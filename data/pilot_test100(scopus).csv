Here we investigated the synergetic effect of stress and environmental enrichment on the immune response of Long-Evans rats. Subjects (n = 46) were assigned to 5 treatment groups: acute compared with chronic stress with or without environmental enrichment, plus an unmanipulated control group. Animals also were classified as active, passive, and flexible copers according to back-test assessment. Rats were exposed to enrichment in an open-field containing objects in different areas for 30 min 3 times each week, thus modeling the effects of a temporary increase in environmental stimuli. Animals assigned to chronic stress groups were exposed to predator sound stressors for 30 min daily, whereas animals assigned to acute stress groups were exposed once each week. After 7 wk, a dermal punch biopsy was administered to activate the immune response, after which rats were challenged through a forced swim test. Biologic samples were collected to measure corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), oxytocin, testosterone, and the cytokines IL6 and IL10. Rats exposed to chronic stress had lower DHEA:corticosterone ratios, suggesting increased allostatic load. Enrichment exposure modulated these effects, lowering overall corticosterone and testosterone levels and increasing DHEA and oxytocin levels in animals exposed to the predator sound. The immune response was decreased in rats exposed to chronic stress, but the effect of environmental enrichment helped to mitigate the negative influence on cells producing IL6. Combining acute stress and exposure to an enriched environment returned a healthier profile in terms of both immune activation and stress regulation. By using a multidimensional scaling model, we found that a combination of 'good' stress and exposure to brief sessions of enriching stimuli can reliably predict health in Long-Evans rats. © 2019 American Association for Laboratory Animal Science",,"animal; environment; immunization; immunology; immunomodulation; Long Evans rat; physiological stress; rat; Animals; Environment; Immunization; Immunomodulation; Rats; Rats, Long-Evans; Stress, Physiological",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albers, HE., Species, sex, and individual differences in the vasotocin/vasopressin system: relationship to neurochemical signaling in the social behavior neural network (2015) Front Neuroendocrinol, 36, pp. 49-71. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2014.07.001; Anisman, H., Cascading effects of stressors and inflammatory immune system activation: implications for major depressive disorder (2009) J Psychiatry Neurosci, 34, pp. 4-20; Aschbacher, K, O'Donovan, A, Wolkowitz, OM, Dhabhar, FS, Su, Y, Epel, E., Good stress, bad stress, and oxidative stress: insights from anticipatory cortisol reactivity (2013) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 38, pp. 1698-1708. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.02.004; Baier, PC, May, U, Scheller, J, Rose-John, S, Schiffelholz, T., Impaired hippocampus-dependent and -independent learning in IL6-deficient mice (2009) Behav Brain Res, 200, pp. 192-196. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2009.01.013; Bardi, M, Kaufman, C, Franssen, C, Hyer, MM, Rzucidlo, A, Brown, M, Tschirhart, M, Lambert, KG., Paper or plastic?

Recently we have shown that single acute restraint stress (2 h) in rats induces a late anxiety-related behavior (observed ten days after stress), whereas, in the present work, we found that the same stress impaired fear extinction in animals conditioned ten days after stress. Fourteen days of environmental enrichment (EE) prevented the deleterious effect of stress on fear memory extinction. Additionally, we observed that EE prevented the stress-induced increase in AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit phosphorylation in the hippocampus, but not in the basolateral amygdala complex and the frontal cortex, indicating a potential mechanism by which it exerts its protective effect against the stress-induced behavioral outcome. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"AMPA receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; synaptophysin; alpha amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid; acute stress; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; basolateral amygdala; controlled study; data analysis software; environmental enrichment; fear conditioning test; footshock; freezing; frontal cortex; hippocampus; immobilization stress; long term memory; male; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; rat; Western blotting; animal; fear; hippocampus; mental stress; phosphorylation; posttraumatic stress disorder; reinforcement (psychology); alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid; Animals; Extinction, Psychological; Fear; Hippocampus; Phosphorylation; Rats; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological",,"alpha amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid, 77521-29-0; alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid",,,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 2016/03572-3, 2019/00908-9; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 142260/2019-3, 2018/15982-7; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 2012/24002-0, 2018/19599-3, 422523/2016-0","We gratefully thank Guiomar Wiesel for technical assistance.

Technol./Analytics, Getreidemarkt 9/164 AC, A-1060 Vienna, Austria","The use of mass spectrometry based on atmospheric pressure ionisation techniques (atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation, APCI, and electrospray ionisation, ESI) for speciation analysis is reviewed with emphasis on the literature published in and after 1999. This report accounts for the increasing interest that atmospheric pressure ionisation techniques, and in particular ESI, have found in the past years for qualitative and quantitative speciation analysis. In contrast to element-selective detectors, organic mass spectrometric techniques provide information on the intact metal species which can be used for the identification of unknown species (particularly with MS-MS detection) or the confirmation of the actual presence of species in a given sample. Due to the complexity of real samples, it is inevitable in all but the simplest cases to couple atmospheric pressure MS detection to a separation technique. Separation in the liquid phase (capillary electrophoresis or liquid chromatography in reversed phase, ion chromatographic or size-exclusion mode) is particularly suitable since the available techniques cover a very wide range of analyte polarities and molecular mass. Moreover, derivatisation can normally be avoided in liquid-phase separation. Particularly in complex environmental or biological samples, separation in one dimension is not sufficient for obtaining adequate resolution for all relevant species. In this case, multi-dimensional separation, based on orthogonal separation techniques, has proven successful. ESI-MS is also often used in parallel with inductively coupled plasma MS detection. This review is structured in two parts. In the first, the fundamentals of atmospheric pressure ionisation techniques are briefly reviewed. The second part of the review discusses recent applications including redox species, use of ESI-MS for structural elucidation of metal complexes, characterisation and quantification of small organometallic species with relevance to environment, health and food. Particular attention is given to the characterisation of biomolecules and metalloproteins (metallothioneins and phytochelatins) and to the investigation of the interaction of metals and biomolecules. Particularly in the latter field, ESI-MS is the ideal technique due to the softness of the ionisation process which allows to assume that the detected gas-phase ions are a true representation of the ions or ion-biomolecule complexes prevalent in solution. It is particularly this field, important to biochemistry, physiology and medical chemistry, where we can expect significant developments also in the future. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

It has been identified to be a factor both in physiological reward-seeking behavior and in development of addiction. Its expression in the nucleus accumbens in response to chronic stimulation of the reward system triggers neuroplasticity in this system. Although δFosB expression increases in response to many different stimuli, its exact effects differ depending strictly on the brain region and type of neurons in which the expression takes place. Among stimuli known to induce δFosB expression are exercise, sexual activity, calorie-rich foods and stress, but also psychoactive drugs (stimulants, opioids, alcohol, tobacco, propofol), electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotics of both generations and antidepressants. Increased δFosB levels in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons with dominant D1 receptor expression have been associated in mice with stress resilience, but also with increased susceptibility to developing an addiction and higher frequency of risky behaviors. Increased δFosB expression in the same neuron type, but with dominant D2 receptor has been observed after rearing mice in a mentally enriching environment and following high-sucrose drink consumption. Decreased δFosB levels have been demonstrated post mortem in the nucleus accumbens in patients suffering from depression and in the prefrontal cortex after chronic antipsychotic drug administration. The δFosB half-life is exceptionally long - this protein has been shown to last even for several months after cessation of the stimuli - and it accumulates following chronic stimulation. Both its abnormal stability and neuroplasticity-inducing properties could explain the chronic course of addiction.",Addiction; Nucleus accumbens; Stress; δFosB,alcohol; antidepressant agent; dopamine 1 receptor; neuroleptic agent; opiate; propofol; transcription factor FosB; addiction; Article; coping behavior; electroconvulsive therapy; human; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; protein expression; protein function; reward; stimulus response; tobacco,,"alcohol, 64-17-5; opiate, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4; propofol, 2078-54-8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akbarian, S., Sucher, N.J., Bradley, D., Selective alterations in gene expression for NMDA receptor subunits in prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics (1996) J Neurosci, 16, pp. 19-30; Andreazza, A.C., Shao, L., Wang, J.F., Young, L.T., Mitochondrial complex I activity and oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins in the prefrontal cortex ofpatients with bipolar disorder (2010) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 67, pp. 360-368; Ang, E., Chen, J., Zagouras, P., Induction of nuclear factorkappaB in nucleus accumbens by chronic cocaine administration (2001) J Neurochem, 79, pp. 221-224; Arnsten, A.F., Stress signalling pathways that impair prefrontal cortex structure and function (2009) Nat Rev Neurosci, 10, pp. 410-422; Belmaker, R.H., Bipolar disorder (2004) N Engl J Med, 351, pp. 476-486; Bibb, J.A., Chen, J., Taylor, J.R., Effects of chronic exposure to cocaine are regulated by the neuronal protein Cdk5 (2001) Nature, 410, pp. 376-380; Biver, F., Goldman, S., Delvenne, V., Frontal and parietal metabolic disturbances in unipolar depression (1994) Biol Psychiatry, 36, pp. 381-388; Blumberg, H.P., Leung, H.C., Skudlarski, P., A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of bipolar disorder: State - and trait-related dysfunction in ventral prefrontal cortices (2003) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 60, pp. 601-609; Brown, J.R., Ye, H., Bronson, R.T., A defect in nurturing in mice lacking the immediate early gene fosB (1996) Cell, 86, pp. 297-309; Carle, T.L., Ohnishi, Y.N., Ohnishi, Y.H., Proteasome-dependent and - Independent mechanisms for FosB destabilization: Identification of FosB degron domains and implications for DeltaFosB stability (2007) Eur J Neurosci, 25, pp. 3009-3019; Chen, J., Kelz, M.B., Hope, B.T., Chronic Fos-related antigens: Stable variants of deltaFosB induced in brain by chronic treatments (1997) J Neurosci, 17, pp. 4933-4941; Chen, J., Newton, S.S., Zeng, L., Downregulation of the CCAAT-enhancer binding protein beta in deltaFosB transgenic mice and by electroconvulsive seizures (2004) Neuropsychopharmacology, 29, pp. 23-31; Cotter, D., Mackay, D., Chana, G., Reduced neuronal size and glial cell density in area 9 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in subjects withmajor depressive disorder (2002) Cereb Cortex, 12, pp. 386-394; Craddock, N., Jones, I., Genetics of bipolar disorder (1999) J Med Genet, 36, pp. 585-594; Devinsky, O., Morrell, M.J., Vogt, B.A., Contributions of anterior cingulate cortex to behaviour (1995) Brain, 118, pp. 279-306; Dietz, D.M., Kennedy, P.J., Sun, H., δFosb induction in prefrontal cortex by antipsychotic drugs is associated with negative behavioral outcomes (2014) Neuropsychopharmacology, 39, pp. 538-544; Elliott, R., Sahakian, B.J., McKay, A.P., Neuropsychological impairments in unipolar depression: The influence of perceived failure on subsequent performance (1996) Psychol Med, 26, pp. 975-989; Elston, G.N., Cortex, cognition and the cell: New insights into the pyramidal neuron and prefrontal function (2003) Cereb Cortex, 13, pp. 1124-1138; Erwin, B.A., Heimberg, R.G., Marx, B.P., Franklin, M.E., Traumatic and socially stressful life events among persons with social anxiety disorder (2006) J Anxiety Disord, 20, pp. 896-914; Figueiredo, H.F., Bruestle, A., Bodie, B., The medial prefrontal cortex differentially regulates stress-induced c-fos expression in the forebrain depending on type of stressor (2003) Eur J Neurosci, 18, pp. 2357-2364; Galynker, I.I., Cai, J., Ongseng, F., Hypofrontality and negative symptoms in major depressive disorder (1998) J Nucl Med, 39, pp. 608-612; Grueter, B.A., Robison, A.J., Neve, R.L., δFosb differentially modulates nucleus accumbens direct and indirect pathway function (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci u S A, 110, pp. 1923-1928; Hewitt, P.L., Dyck, D.G., Perfectionism, stress, and vulnerability to depression (1986) Cogn Ther Res, 10, pp. 137-142; Keshavan, M.S., Anderson, S., Pettegrew, J.W., Is schizophrenia due to excessive synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex?

We sought to determine whether providing an artificial plant in the holding tank as enrichment influenced anxiety-like behaviors and place-preference choice in adult zebrafish. Fish were housed singly or in social groups of 5 for 3 wk in 1 of 4 experimental housing environments: single-housed enriched (n = 30), single-housed barren (n = 30), group-housed enriched (n = 30), and group-housed barren (n = 30). On week 4, individual fish were selected randomly from each of the experimental housing environments and tested by using novel-tank, light-dark, and place-preference tests. Housing fish singly in a barren environment increased anxiety-like behaviors in the novel-tank and light-dark behavioral tests. Single-housed zebrafish in barren tanks as well as zebrafish group-housed with conspecifics, both with and without plant enrichment, spent more time associating with conspecifics than with the artificial plant enrichment device during the place-preference test. Single-housed fish maintained in enriched tanks displayed no preference between a compartment with conspecifics or an artificial plant.

The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects of EE are only partially understood. In the current report, we describe a link between EE and neuropeptide Y (NPY), based on findings from NPY knockout (KO) mice exposed to EE. Relative to EE-housed wildtype (WT) animals, NPY KO mice displayed altered behaviour as well as molecular and morphological changes in amygdala and hippocampus. Exposure of WT mice to EE reduced anxiety and decreased central glucocorticoid receptor expression, effects which were absent in NPY KO mice. In addition, NPY deletion altered the preference of EE items, and EE-housed NPY KO mice responded to stress with exaggerated hyperthermia, displayed impaired spatial memory, had higher hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels and altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity, effects which were not seen in WT mice. Accordingly, these findings suggest that NPY contributes to the anxiolytic effect of EE and that NPY deletion reverses the beneficial effects of EE into a negative experience. The NPY system could thus be a target for ""enviromimetics"", therapeutics which reproduce the beneficial effects of enhanced environmental stimulation.",,"brain derived neurotrophic factor; glucocorticoid receptor; messenger RNA; neuropeptide Y; animal; animal behavior; animal housing; anxiety; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; fever; genetics; knockout mouse; male; maze test; metabolism; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; pathology; physiology; spatial memory; Animals; Anxiety; Behavior, Animal; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Fever; Housing, Animal; Male; Maze Learning; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Neuronal Plasticity; Neuropeptide Y; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; RNA, Messenger; Spatial Memory",,"brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; neuropeptide Y, 82785-45-3, 83589-17-7; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Neuropeptide Y; Receptors, Glucocorticoid; RNA, Messenger",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nithianantharajah, J., Hannan, A.J., Enriched environments, experience-dependent plasticity and disorders of the nervous system (2006) Nat.

Mice were reared either in a deprived environment and subsequently housed in deprived, minimally enriched, or enriched conditions after the removal of the c-row of vibrissae or reared in an enriched environment before and after vibrissae removal. Levels of vesicular zinc were assessed in deprived and nondeprived barrels 6 h to 14 d after vibrissae removal. We found that housing in enriched environmental conditions resulted in a greater change in vesicular zinc levels than did other housing conditions; however, this effect was dependent on both the magnitude and duration of enrichment. Our data indicate that enriched-environment housing has profound effects on the regulation of vesicular zinc that occurs concurrently with experience-dependent plasticity, suggesting a role for zinc in the multitude of cortical modifications associated with enriched environments.

As both environmental enrichment and prenatal alcohol exposure can individually alter neurotrophin expression, we studied the interaction of prenatal alcohol and postweaning environmental enrichment on brain neurotrophin levels in rats. Methods: Pregnant rats received alcohol by gavage, 0, 4, or 6 g/kg/d (Zero, Low, or High groups), or no treatment (Naïve group), on gestational days 8 to 20. After weaning on postnatal day 21, offspring were housed for 6 weeks in Isolated, Social, or Enriched conditions. Levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were then measured in frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar vermis. Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure increased NGF levels in frontal cortex (High-dose group) and cerebellar vermis (High- and Low-dose groups); increased BDNF in frontal cortex, occipital cortex and hippocampus (Low-dose groups), and increased NT-3 in hippocampus and cerebellar vermis (High-dose). Environmental enrichment resulted in lower NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 levels in occipital cortex and lower NGF in frontal cortex. The only significant interaction between prenatal alcohol treatment and environment was in cerebellar vermis where NT-3 levels were higher for enriched animals after prenatal alcohol exposure, but not for animals housed under Isolated or Social conditions. Conclusions: Both prenatal alcohol exposure and postweaning housing conditions alter brain neurotrophin levels, but the effects appear to be largely independent. Although environmental enrichment can improve functional outcomes, these results do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that rearing in a complex environment ameliorates prenatal alcohol effects on brain neurotrophin levels in rats.

On 3rd and 5th day of postnatal life one group of pups received a subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (50 mkg/kg, LPS group) and another group received an injection of saline (Saline group, controls). The testing at the age of 3-3.5 months in an open field and elevated plus maze showed that the housing in social isolation compared to the standard conditions of living led to increase of anxiety in rats, risk assessment behavior (stretch attend postures) and some decline in locomotor and investigatory activity. The most pronounced changes after social isolation occurred in rats of the LPS group. Housing in the enriched environment in rats of the Saline group did not affect a level of anxiety, but could elicit a weak increase of motor and search activity and a risk assessment behavior (hanging). The females of the LPS group showed a non-adequate reaction in the open field - an increase of anxious behavior. A sucrose preference test revealed the signs of depressive-like behavior in females of the LPS group after social isolation and enriched environment. Housing in the social isolation produced the most increase in the blood corticosterone level in response to additional stress. Thus, the early proinflammatory stress increased the reactivity to negative stressed impacts in adulthood, wherein the females were the most vulnerable. © 2021 Maik Nauka-Interperiodica Publishing.

Insects have evolved a variety of genetic, and likely epigenetic, mechanisms to deal with metal stress. A recurring theme in all these systems is complexity and diversity; even simple, single gene, cases are complex. Of the known gene families, the metallothioneins are perhaps the best understood and provide good examples of how diverse metal response is. Interestingly, there is considerable diversity across taxa in these metal-responsive systems, including duplications to form small gene families and complex expression of single loci. Strikingly, different species have evolved different mechanisms to cope with the same, or similar, stress suggesting both independent derivation of, and plasticity in, the pathways involved. It is likely that some metal-response systems evolved early in evolutionary time and have been conserved, while others have diverged, and still others evolved more recently and convergently. In addition to conventional genetics, insects likely respond to environmental metal through a variety of epigenetic systems, but direct tests are lacking. Ultimately, it is likely that classical genetic and epigenetic factors interact in regulating insect metal responses. In light of this diversity across species, future studies including a broad-based examination of gene expression in non-model species in complex environments will likely uncover additional genes and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. © 2017 Merritt and Bewick.",ABC transporter genes; Antioxidant metabolic enzymes; Epigenetic regulation; Insect metal response; Metallothionein,ABC transporter; alpha tubulin; catalase; chromium; copper; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; glutathione transferase; iron; manganese; metallothionein; reactive nitrogen species; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; thiol group; zinc; antibiotic resistance; carbohydrate metabolism; DNA damage; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; energy yield; environmental exposure; epigenetics; gene control; genetic difference; genetic variability; heavy metal poisoning; insect metal tolerance; lipid metabolism; metal tolerance; nonhuman; oxidative stress; Short Survey; soil pollution,,"alpha tubulin, 78769-62-7; catalase, 9001-05-2; chromium, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; glutathione, 70-18-8; glutathione peroxidase, 9013-66-5; glutathione reductase, 9001-48-3; glutathione transferase, 50812-37-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Achard-Joris, M., Moreau, J.-L., Lucas, M., Baudrimont, M., Mesmer-Dudons N Gonzalez, P., Boudou, A., Bourdineaud, J.-P., Role of metallothioneins in superoxide radical generation during copper redox cycling: defining the fundamental function of metallothioneins (2007) Biochimie, 89, pp. 1474-1488; Alvarez M Schrey, A.W., Richards, C.L., Ten years of transcriptomics in wild populations: what have we learned about their ecology and evolution?

Environmental enrichment, which enhances cognitive stimulation and physical activity, modifies various behaviors and reduces stress responses in adult rodents. We investigated the transgenerational influence of paternal environmental enrichment on offspring behavior and physiological stress response. Adult C57BL/6J male mice (F0) were exposed to either environmental enrichment or standard housing for four weeks and then pair-mated with naïve females. The F2 generation was generated using F1 male offspring. Male and female F1 and F2 offspring were tested for anxiety using the elevated-plus maze and large open field at 8 weeks of age. Depression-related behavior was assessed using the forced-swim test. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function was determined by quantification of serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels at baseline and after forced-swim stress. Paternal environmental enrichment was associated with increased body weights of male F1 and F2 offspring. There was no significant effect on F1 offspring anxiety and depression-related behaviors. There were no changes in anxiety-related behaviors in the F2 offspring, however these mice displayed a reduced latency to immobility in the forced-swim test. Furthermore, F2 females had significantly higher serum corticosterone levels post-stress, but not ACTH. These results show that paternal environmental enrichment exerts a sex-specific transgenerational impact on the behavioral and physiological response to stress. Our findings have implications for the modelling of psychiatric disorders in rodents. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Corticosterone; Environmental enrichment; Epigenetic inheritance; HPA axis; Stress response; Transgenerational,"corticosterone; corticotropin; corticosterone; corticotropin; adult; affect; age; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal housing; animal model; anxiety; Article; body weight; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; corticotropin blood level; depression; elevated plus maze test; environmental enrichment; father; female; forced swim test; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; immobility; latent period; male; mouse; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; open field test; paternal environmental enrichment; progeny; sex difference; stress; animal; blood; C57BL mouse; environment; genetic epigenesis; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; mental stress; pathophysiology; physiological stress; physiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; swimming; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Corticosterone; Depression; Environment; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Housing, Animal; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Stress, Physiological; Stress, Psychological; Swimming",,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; corticotropin, 11136-52-0, 9002-60-2, 9061-27-2; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Corticosterone",,,"University of Texas at Austin, UT; Australian Research Council, ARC; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC: 1083468","We thank Shanshan Li for technical assistance and Dr. Dana Most of the Waggoner Center at the University of Texas at Austin, USA for the valuable comments and scientific editing.

The chicks were housed in same‐sex groups of 10. The bare environments contained wood litter, food, and water, whereas the enriched boxes also contained various objects. In the open field, immobility was lower while feeding, walking, jumping and vocalization were higher in the enriched birds than in those reared in the bare environment. Enrichment also decreased emergence latencies in the hole‐in‐the‐wall box. The increased stimulation provided by environmental enrichment may decrease fearfulness in subsequent fear‐inducing situations and may enhance the ability of animals to adapt to novelty.

More recently, histone mechanisms affecting cell type- and regional-specific chromatin structures have also been shown to contribute to transcriptional programs related to depressive behaviors, as well as responses to antidepressants. Although much emphasis has been placed in recent years on roles for histone posttranslational modifications and chromatin-remodeling events in the etiology of MDD, it has become increasingly clear that replication-independent histone variants (e.g., H3.3), which differ in primary amino acid sequence from their canonical counterparts, similarly play critical roles in the regulation of activity-dependent neuronal transcription, synaptic connectivity, and behavioral plasticity. Here, we demonstrate a role for increased H3.3 dynamics in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) - a key limbic brain reward region - in the regulation of aberrant social stress-mediated gene expression and the precipitation of depressive-like behaviors in mice. We find that molecular blockade of these dynamics promotes resilience to chronic social stress and results in a partial renormalization of stressassociated transcriptional patterns in the NAc. In sum, our findings establish H3.3 dynamics as a critical, and previously undocumented, regulator of mood and suggest that future therapies aimed at modulating striatal histone dynamics may potentiate beneficial behavioral adaptations to negative emotional stimuli.",Chronic social defeat stress;

For example, rats reared in an impoverished condition (IC; reared alone in hanging metal cages), social condition (SC; reared in standard shoebox cages, 2 per cage), or enriched condition (EC; reared in a large metal cage with bedding, 14 novel objects, and 10 cohorts) display clear differences in the amount of drug they consume and/or self-administer through operant responding. Animals reared in an EC consume greater amounts of ethanol compared with rats reared in an IC when provided free access, but it is not known how differential rearing conditions affect operant responding for ethanol. Methods: Twenty-eight male Long-Evans rats were reared in 1 of 3 environments (IC, SC, or EC) during postnatal days 21 to 111. At the conclusion of the rearing period, all rats underwent sucrose/ethanol fading and then were tested for lever press responding for 10% ethanol as well as ethanol preference. Results: Rats reared in an IC responded for 10% ethanol at significantly higher rates than SC and EC rats. A greater percentage of IC rats were able to switch lever responding when the ethanol availability was changed to a second lever. Lastly, the IC group was the only one to display a clear preference for 10% ethanol when both this fluid and water were available. Conclusion: Rats reared in an IC show greater proclivity to respond operantly for 10% ethanol compared with rats raised in either SC or EC (which did not differ from each other). These findings agree with a number of studies that have shown isolate reared animals to consume greater amounts of ethanol compared with their socially reared counterparts yet contrast some studies showing EC animals consume greater amounts of ethanol than IC rats. The current findings illustrate that rearing environment also plays an important role in an animal's proclivity to respond for ethanol. © 2007 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.",Alcohol; Environmental Enrichment; Isolation; Social Environment,"alcohol; alcohol consumption; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; controlled study; drinking behavior; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; rearing; social environment; Alcoholism; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Central Nervous System Depressants; Conditioning, Operant; Ethanol; Male; Rats; Rats, Long-Evans; Social Environment; Social Isolation; Animalia; Rattus",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; Central Nervous System Depressants; Ethanol, 64-17-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bardo, M.T., Klebaur, J.E., Valone, J.M., Deaton, C., Environmental enrichment decreases intravenous self-administration of amphetamine in female and male rats (2001) Psychopharmacology, 155, pp. 278-284; Bardo, M.T., Valone, J.M., Robinet, P.M., Shaw, W.B., Dwoskin, L.P., Environmental enrichment enhances the stimulant effect of intravenous amphetamine: Search for a cellular mechanism in the nucleus accumbens (1999) Psychobiology, 27, pp. 292-299; Bruning, J.L., Kintz, B.L., (1977) Computational Handbook of Statistics., , Scott Foresman and Company, Glenview, IL; Cain, M.E., Green, T.A., Bardo, M.T., Environmental enrichment decreases responding for visual novelty (2006) Behav Processes, 73, pp. 360-366; Deatherage, G., Effects of housing density on alcohol intake in the rat (1972) Physiol Behav, 9, pp. 55-57; Del Arco, A., Segovia, G., Garrido, P., De Blas, M., Mora, F., Stress, prefrontal cortex and environmental enrichment: Studies on dopamine and acetylcholine release and working memory performance in rats (2007) Behav Brain Res, 176, pp. 267-273; Ding, Y., Kang, L., Li, B., Ma, B., Enhanced cocaine self-administration in adult rats with adolescent isolation experience (2005) Pharmacol Biochem Behav, 82, pp. 673-677; Djouma, E., Card, K., Lodge, D.J., Lawrence, A.J., The CRF1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin, reverses isolation-induced up-regulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens of fawn-hooded rats (2006) Eur J Neurosci, 23, pp. 3319-3327; Fulford, A.J., Marsden, C.A., Effect of isolation-rearing on conditioned dopamine release in vivo in the nucleus accumbens of the rat (1998) J Neurochem, 70, pp. 384-390; Gonzales, R.A., Job, M.O., Doyon, W.M., The role of mesolimbic dopamine in the development and maintenance of ethanol reinforcement (2004) Pharmacol Ther, 103, pp. 121-146; Green, T.A., Gehrke, B.J., Bardo, M.T., Environmental enrichment decreases intravenous amphetamine self-administration in rats: Dose-response functions for fixed- and progressive-ratio schedules (2002) Psychopharmacology, 162, pp. 373-378; Hall, F.S., Huang, S., Fong, G.W., Pert, A., Linnoila, M., Effects of isolation-rearing on voluntary consumption of ethanol, sucrose, and saccharin solutions in Fawn Hooded and Wistar rats (1998) Psychopharmacology, 139, pp. 210-216; Hall, F.S., Wilkinson, L.S., Humby, T., Inglis, W., Kendall, D.A., Marsden, C.A., Robbins, T.W., Isolation rearing in rats: Pre- and post-synaptic changes in striatal dopaminergic systems (1998) Pharmocol Biochem Behav, 59, pp. 859-872; Hill, S.Y., Powell, B.J., Cocaine and morphine self-administration: Effects of differential rearing (1976) Pharmacol Biochem Behav, 5, pp. 701-704; Karim, A., Arslan, M.I., Isolation modifies the behavioral response in rats (2000) Bangladesh Med Res Counc Bull, 26, pp. 27-32; Kazmaier, K., Butcher, R.E., Senter, R.J., Stutz, R.M., Rearing conditions and ethanol consumption by rats (1973) J Stud Alcohol, 34, pp. 520-524; Kiianmaa, K., Hyytiä, P., Samson, H.H., Engel, J.A., Svensson, L., Söderpalm, B., Larsson, A., Ryabinin, A.E., New neuronal networks involved in ethanol reinforcement (2003) Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 27, pp. 209-219; Koob, G., Le Moal, M., Drug addiction, dysregulation of reward, and allostasis (2001) Neuropsychopharmacology, 24, pp. 97-129; Lapiz, M.D., Fulford, A., Muchimapura, S., Mason, R., Parker, T., Marsden, C.A., Influence of postweaning social isolation in the rat on brain development, conditioned behavior, and neurotransmission (2003) Neurosci Behav Physiol, 33, pp. 13-29; Lesage, M.G., Stafford, D., Glowa, J.R., Preclinical research on cocaine self-administration: Environmental determinants and their interaction with pharmacological treatment (1999) Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 23, pp. 717-741; Lodge, D.J., Lawrence, A.J., The effect of isolation rearing on volitional ethanol consumption and central CCK/dopamine systems in Fawn-Hooded rats (2003) Behav Brain Res, 141, pp. 113-122; Murtha, S., Pappas, B.A., Raman, S., Neonatal and adult forebrain norepinephrine depletion and the behavioral and cortical thickening effects of enriched/impoverished environment (1990) Behav Brain Res, 39, pp. 249-261; (1996) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals., , National Institute of Health.

We assessed the effect of an environmental enrichment (EE) protocol (24 h/day over a period of two months) on anxiety-related behaviors when aged Wistar rats (21 months old) were confronted with cat odor stimuli. Owing to the relationship between GABAergic interneurons and the anxiety-related neuronal network, we examined changes in the expression of Parvalbumin (PV) and 67 kDa form of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-67) immunoreactive cells in different brain regions involved in stress response. Behavioral results revealed that enriched rats traveled further and made more grooming behaviors during the habituation session. In the cat odor session, they traveled longer distances and they showed more active interaction with the odor stimuli and less time in freezing behavior. Zone analysis revealed that the enriched group spent more time in the intermediate zone according to the proximity of the predator odor. Regarding the neurobiological data, the EE increased the expression of PV-positive cells in some medial prefrontal regions (cingulate (Cg) and prelimbic (PL) cortices), whereas the GAD-67 expression in the basolateral amygdala was reduced in the enriched group. Our results suggest that EE is able to reduce anxiety-like behaviors in aged animals even when ethologically relevant stimuli are used. Moreover, GABAergic interneurons could be involved in mediating this resilient behavior. © 2016 IBRO.",Aging; Cat odor; Environmental enrichment; GABA; Parvalbumin; Wistar rat,"glutamate decarboxylase 67; parvalbumin; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; fragrance; glutamate decarboxylase; glutamate decarboxylase 1; parvalbumin; aged; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety disorder; Article; basolateral amygdala; cat odor; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; coping behavior; environmental enrichment; GABAergic system; habituation; immunohistochemistry; interneuron; nerve cell network; nonhuman; odor; prelimbic cortex; priority journal; protein expression; rat; stimulus response; stress; therapy effect; treatment duration; aging; animal; animal housing; anxiety; cat; environment; exploratory behavior; grooming; interneuron; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; physical stimulation; physiology; predation; psychological resilience; psychology; therapy; Wistar rat; Aging; Animals; Anxiety; Cats; Environment; Exploratory Behavior; GABAergic Neurons; Glutamate Decarboxylase; Grooming; Housing, Animal; Immunohistochemistry; Interneurons; Models, Animal; Odorants; Parvalbumins; Physical Stimulation; Predatory Behavior; Rats, Wistar; Resilience, Psychological",,"parvalbumin, 56094-12-3, 83667-75-8; glutamate decarboxylase, 9024-58-2; Glutamate Decarboxylase; glutamate decarboxylase 1; Parvalbumins",,,"Ministério da Educação e Ciência, MEC; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: AP2010-1654","We would like to thank Daniel Grace for revising the English text of this manuscript and Piedad Burgos, Begoña Diaz and Juan Gómez Repiso for their technical assistance.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an extracellular signaling phospholipid with important neural regulatory properties mediated by specific G protein-coupled receptors, LPA1-5. LPA1 is highly expressed in the developing neurogenic ventricular zone wherein it is required for normal embryonic neurogenesis, and, by extension may play a role in adult neurogenesis as well. By means of the analyses of a variant of the original LPA1-null mutant mouse, termed the Malaga variant or ""maLPA1-null,"" which has recently been reported to have defective neurogenesis within the embryonic cerebral cortex, we report here a role for LPA1 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Proliferation, differentiation and survival of newly formed neurons are defective in the absence of LPA1 under normal conditions and following exposure to enriched environment and voluntary exercise. Furthermore, analysis of trophic factors in maLPA1-null mice demonstrated alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin growth factor 1 levels after enrichment and exercise. Morphological analyses of doublecortin positive cells revealed the anomalous prevalence of bipolar cells in the subgranular zone, supporting the operation of LPA1 signaling pathways in normal proliferation, maturation and differentiation of neuronal precursors. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.",Adult neurogenesis; Doublecortin; GPCR; Hippocampus; LPA1 receptor; Lysophosphatidic acid; maLPA1-null mouse; Plasticity,"lysophosphatidic acid receptor; somatomedin; animal experiment; article; brain cortex; brain nerve cell; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; dentate gyrus; embryo development; hippocampus; morphology; mouse; mutant; nervous system development; nonhuman; priority journal; Animals; Apoptosis; Behavior, Animal; Biological Markers; Dentate Gyrus; Gene Deletion; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Neurogenesis; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Random Allocation; Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid; Mus",,"Biological Markers; Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid",,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: R29MH051699; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R01NS048478",,,,,,,,,,,"Åberg, M.A.I., Åberg, N.D., Palmer, T.D., Alborn, A., Carlsson-Skwirut, C., Bang, P., Rosengren, L.E., Eriksson, P.S., IGF-I has a direct proliferative effect in adult hippocampal progenitor cells (2003) Mol.

Our study was designed to determine possible benefits of pre-exposure to EE in preventing functional deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the prefrontal cortex. To examine the benefit of EE, adult male rats were placed in an enriched environment for 15 days. Enrichment was provided through social interaction, exercise, olfactory stimulation, and new objects/toys to explore. Following enrichment, experimental and age-matched controls were subjected to a moderate medial prefrontal cortex injury via controlled cortical impact. After one week recovery, animals were behaviorally tested to assess memory, anxiety, and sensory neglect. Lesion-induced deficits in spatial memory (Morris water maze) were significantly attenuated in EE pre-exposed rats 18-21 days following injury. In addition, TBI-induced sensory neglect was significantly reduced in EE rats relative to non-enriched animals. No differences in anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze (EPM) were detected. The behavioral data suggest that EE is neuroprotective when applied prior to TBI, resulting in improved recovery following injury. © 2013 Johnson.",Controlled cortical impact; Environmental enrichment; Morris water maze; Sensory neglect; Traumatic brain injury,adult animal; age; animal behavior; animal experiment; anxiety; article; controlled study; environmental enrichment; exercise; experimental test; functional disease; male; memory; Morris water maze; nerve stimulation; neuroprotection; nonhuman; olfactory system; prefrontal cortex; rat; sensory dysfunction; sensory neglect; social interaction; spatial memory; traumatic brain injury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Barnett, V., Lewis, T., (1994) Outliers In Statistical Data, , third ed.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that enriched environment (EE) treatment can promote structural and behavioral plasticity in the brain and dampen stress-induced alterations of neuroplasticity. Here, we have examined whether short term exposure to EE is able to produce antidepressant-like effects. Our results show that housing adult mice in an EE cage for 7 days led to antidepressant-like behavioral profiles and a significant increase in the number of dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These EE-induced antidepressant-like effects are primarily attributed to increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression through a hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-mediated transcriptional mechanism. Blockade of HIF-1α synthesis by lentiviral infection with HIF-1α small hairpin RNAs completely blocked the increase in expression of VEGF and the antidepressant-like effects induced by EE. Moreover, no significant antidepressant-like effects were observed with EE treatment in VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1) knock-out mice. The increase in HIF-1αexpression in the hippocampus induced by EE was associated with a decrease in endogenous levels of microRNA-107 (miR-107). Overexpression of miR-107 in the hippocampus completely blocked EE-induced HIF-1α expression and the antidepressant-like effects. These results support a model in which the down-regulation of miR-107, acting through HIF-1α, mediates VEGF-dependent spinogenesis to underlie the EE-induced antidepressant-like effects. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Adult mice; Behavioral profiles; CA1 pyramidal neuron; Dendritic spine; Down-regulation; Endogenous level; Hairpin RNA; Hypoxia-inducible factor 1; Knock outs; Neuroplasticity; Over-expression; Short-term exposure; Stress-induced; Transcriptional mechanisms; Vascular endothelial growth; Vascular endothelial growth factor; RNA; Brain; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; microRNA 107; vasculotropin; vasculotropin receptor 2; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell count; controlled study; dendritic spine; depression; environmental enrichment; female; hippocampal CA1 region; mouse; nerve cell differentiation; newborn; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein synthesis; signal transduction; therapy effect; Animals; Antidepressive Agents; Brain; Corticosterone; Environment; Golgi Apparatus; Hippocampus; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Lentivirus; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; MicroRNAs; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Synapses; Transcription, Genetic; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Mus",,"vasculotropin, 127464-60-2; Antidepressive Agents; Corticosterone, 50-22-6; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; MIRN107 microRNA, mouse; MicroRNAs; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wong, M.L., Licinio, J., Research and treatment approaches to depression (2001) Nat.

These interventions show an array of methodologies and sometimes unclear collective conclusions, hampering clinical interpretations. Here we discuss environmental enrichment, exercise and stress interventions to illustrate how different protocols can affect the interpretations of environmental factors in disease. We use Huntington's disease (HD) as an example because its mouse models exhibit excellent validity and HD was the first genetic animal model in which environmental stimulation was found to be beneficial. We make a number of observations and recommendations. Firstly, environmental enrichment and voluntary exercise generally show benefits across laboratories and mouse models. However, the extent to which these environmental interventions have beneficial effects depends on parameters such as the structural complexity of the cage in the case of enrichment, the timing of the intervention and the nature of the control conditions. In particular, clinical interpretations should consider deprived control living conditions and the ethological relevance of the enrichment. Secondly, stress can have negative effects on the phenotype in mouse models of HD and other brain disorders. When modeling stress, the effects of more than one type of experimental stressor should be investigated due to the heterogeneity and complexity of stress responses. With stress in particular, but ideally in all studies, both sexes should be used and the randomized group sizes need to be sufficiently powered to detect any sex effects. Opportunities for clinical translation will be guided by the 'environmental construct validity' of the preclinical data, including the culmination of complementary protocols across multiple animal models. Environmental interventions in mouse models of HD provide illustrative examples of how valid preclinical studies can lead to conclusions relevant to clinical populations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive activity; Construct validity; Diet; Environmental enrichment; Environmental modifiers; Exercise; Experience-dependent plasticity; Face validity; Gene-environment interactions; Housing conditions; Huntington's disease; Lifestyle; Mouse models; Neurodegenerative disorders; Neurological disease; Physical activity; Polyglutamine disease; Predictive validity; Psychiatric disorders; Sensory stimulation; Stress; Tandem repeat disorders; Transgenic mice,"acute stress; Alzheimer disease; animal housing; autosomal dominant inheritance; CAG repeat; cage; cognition; construct validity; depression; disease course; emotionality; energy metabolism; environmental enrichment; environmental factor; environmental impact; epilepsy; exercise; exploratory behavior; genotype environment interaction; gnawing; Huntington chorea; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; immobilization stress; lifestyle; motor performance; multiple sclerosis; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; nesting; nonhuman; phenotype; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; Review; running; schizophrenia; sex difference; somatosensory stimulation; stress; thermoregulation; treadmill; animal; animal housing; disease model; genetics; Huntington chorea; mental stress; motor activity; psychology; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gene-Environment Interaction; Housing, Animal; Huntington Disease; Motor Activity; Stress, Psychological",,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC: 140100588; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC: 1047674, 1083468, 1085977","We thank past and present members of the Hannan Laboratory for useful discussions.

Studies on boldness in crustaceans typically focus on their behavior, while relatively few studies have focused on the formation and maintenance of and change in boldness, such as energy metabolism and neurotransmission. In this study, we measured the boldness of swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) and analyzed the relationship between boldness and oxygen consumption rate, energy concentration, and the relative expression of en-ergy-metabolism-related and 5-HT genes in mRNA. The results showed that boldness remained stable across repeated tests but changed under dangerous conditions. Swimming crabs could be divided into bold and shy individuals. Bold individuals consumed oxygen at a significantly higher rate than shy individuals. Lactate and glucose concentrations in hemolymph were significantly lower in bold individuals than in shy individuals, and mRNA relative expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and 5-HT genes was significantly higher in bold than in shy individuals. Preliminary results indi-cate that energy metabolism and neurotransmitters may underlie the formation and maintenance of personality characteristics of swimming crabs. Swimming crabs also exhibit behavioral flexibility in order to cope with risks. This may be an adaptation to their complex environments. © 2022 by the authors.

There is no consensus on the nature of wheel-running activity or its underlying causes, however. Here, we will begin by systematically reviewing how running wheel availability affects physical activity and other aspects of energy balance in laboratory rodents. While wheel running and physical activity in the absence of a wheel commonly correlate in a general sense, in many specific aspects the two do not correspond. In fact, the presence of running wheels alters several aspects of energy balance, including body weight and composition, food intake, and energy expenditure of activity. We contend that wheel-running activity should be considered a behavior in and of itself, reflecting several underlying behavioral processes in addition to a rodent's general, spontaneous activity. These behavioral processes include defensive behavior, predatory aggression, and depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. As it relates to energy balance, wheel running engages several brain systems-including those related to the stress response, mood, and reward, and those responsive to growth factors-that influence energy balance indirectly. We contend that wheel-running behavior represents factors in addition to rodents' tendency to be physically active, engaging additional neural and physiological mechanisms which can then independently alter energy balance and behavior. Given the impact of wheel-running behavior on numerous overlapping systems that influence behavior and physiology, this review outlines the need for careful design and interpretation of studies that utilize running wheels as a means for exercise or as a measurement of general physical activity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Brain; Energy balance; Reward; Running wheel; Wheel-running activity,"endocannabinoid; escitalopram; animal behavior; body composition; body weight; circadian rhythm; conditioning; coping behavior; cross allergy; energy balance; energy expenditure; environmental enrichment; epigenetics; estrus cycle; exercise; food availability; food intake; forced swimming test; homeostasis; immobilization; metabolism; motivation; nervous system development; nonhuman; physical activity; priority journal; review; reward; treadmill; Animals; Brain; Cricetinae; Eating; Energy Metabolism; Environment; Female; Humans; Male; Mice; Motor Activity; Obesity; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Rats; Reward; Rodentia; Running",,"escitalopram, 128196-01-0, 219861-08-2",,,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: P30DK050456; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R01NS055859",,,,,,,,,,,"Adachi, M., Barrot, M., Autry, A.E., Theobald, D., Monteggia, L.M., Selective loss of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the dentate gyrus attenuates antidepressant efficacy (2008) Biol.

Therefore, it has been theorized that RNA viruses require high error rates for survival, and that a virus with high fidelity would be less able to cope in complex environments. We previously isolated and characterized poliovirus with a mutation in the viral polymerase, 3D-G64S, which confers resistance to mutagenic nucleotide analogs via increased fidelity. The 3D-G64S virus was less pathogenic than wild-type virus in poliovirus-receptor transgenic mice, even though only slight growth defects were observed in tissue culture. To determine whether the high-fidelity phenotype of the 3D-G64S virus could decrease its fitness under a defined selective pressure, we compared growth of the 3D-G64S virus and 3D wild-type virus in the context of a revertible attenuating point mutation, 2C-F28S. Even with a 10-fold input advantage, the 3D-G64S virus was unable to compete with 3D wild-type virus in the context of the revertible attenuating mutation; however, in the context of a non-revertible version of the 2C-F28S attenuating mutation, 3D-G64S virus matched the replication of 3D wild-type virus. Therefore, the 3D-G64S high-fidelity phenotype reduced viral fitness under a defined selective pressure, making it likely that the reduced spread in murine tissue could be caused by the increased fidelity of the viral polymerase. © 2005 Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard.",,"virus RNA;

Specifically, several members of the FGF family have been shown to be dysregulated in individuals with major depression. In this review, we will introduce the FGF system in terms of structure and function during development, in adulthood, and in various regions and cell types. We will also review the FGF system as a mediator of neural plasticity. Furthermore, this review will summarize animal as well as human studies. The majority of animal studies have focused on stress, environmental enrichment, pharmacological manipulations, and the hippocampus. By contrast, human studies have focused on volumetric measurements, antidepressant literature, and, most recently, post-mortem microarray experiments.

The psychosocial predictors reviewed include novelty-pre-exposure, control-helplessness, restraint, Type A behavior, life change, bereavement, denial, social support and contact, voodoo, psychiatric illness, mother infant separation, submission-defeat, housing, handling and environmental enrichment. Four of these predictors, controllability-helplessness, pre-exposure-novelty, depressive affect and physical restraint are repeatedly cited in both human and animal studies and their importance is critically evaluated. Methodological and substantive recommendations for future research are made and a discussion of possible mechanisms is presented. © 1985.",,"bereavement; canada; child; etiology; fatality; geographic distribution; heart; heart disease; human; injury; life event; methodology; personality; psychological aspect; psychosocial environment; restraint; short survey; social aspect; sudden death; sudden infant death syndrome; Adaptation, Psychological; Animal; Arousal; Arrhythmia; Death, Sudden; Electrocardiography; Heart Arrest; Human; Life Change Events; Medicine, Traditional; Risk; Social Environment; Social Support; Sudden Infant Death; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Type A Personality; Wounds and Injuries",,,,,"Medical Research Council Canada, MRC","Acknowledgements-1 am grateful to Audrey Bennet, Mike Feuerstein, James Lawler.

Box 1870, 5817 Bergen, Norway","Behaviour represents a reaction to the environment as fish perceive it and is therefore a key element of fish welfare. This review summarises the main findings on how behavioural changes have been used to assess welfare in farmed fish, using both functional and feeling-based approaches. Changes in foraging behaviour, ventilatory activity, aggression, individual and group swimming behaviour, stereotypic and abnormal behaviour have been linked with acute and chronic stressors in aquaculture and can therefore be regarded as likely indicators of poor welfare. On the contrary, measurements of exploratory behaviour, feed anticipatory activity and reward-related operant behaviour are beginning to be considered as indicators of positive emotions and welfare in fish. Despite the lack of scientific agreement about the existence of sentience in fish, the possibility that they are capable of both positive and negative emotions may contribute to the development of new strategies (e. g. environmental enrichment) to promote good welfare. Numerous studies that use behavioural indicators of welfare show that behavioural changes can be interpreted as either good or poor welfare depending on the fish species. It is therefore essential to understand the species-specific biology before drawing any conclusions in relation to welfare. In addition, different individuals within the same species may exhibit divergent coping strategies towards stressors, and what is tolerated by some individuals may be detrimental to others. Therefore, the assessment of welfare in a few individuals may not represent the average welfare of a group and vice versa. This underlines the need to develop on-farm, operational behavioural welfare indicators that can be easily used to assess not only the individual welfare but also the welfare of the whole group (e. g. spatial distribution). With the ongoing development of video technology and image processing, the on-farm surveillance of behaviour may in the near future represent a low-cost, noninvasive tool to assess the welfare of farmed fish. © 2011 The Author(s).",Appraisal; Aquaculture; Fish behaviour; Mental states; Operational welfare indicators; Stress; Well-being,"animal; animal behavior; animal welfare; fish; food industry; physiology; review; Animal Welfare; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Fisheries; Fishes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alanärä, A., Brännäs, E., Dominance in demand-feeding behaviour in Arctic charr and rainbow trout: the effect of stocking density (1996) J Fish Biol, 48, pp. 242-254; Alanärä, A., Winberg, S., Brännäs, E., Kiessling, A., Höglund, E., Elofsson, U., Feeding behaviour, brain serotonergic activity levels, and energy reserves of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) within a dominance hierarchy (1998) Can J Zool, 76, pp. 212-220; Almazán-Rueda, P., (2004) Towards assessment of welfare in African catfish Clarias gariepinus: The first step, p. 160. , PhD thesis, Wageningen University; Almazán-Rueda, P., Schrama, J.W., Verreth, J.A.J., Behavioural responses under different feeding methods and light regimes of the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) juveniles (2004) Aquaculture, 231, pp. 347-359; Almazán-Rueda, P., van Helmond, A.T.M., Verreth, J.A.J., Schrama, J.W., Photoperiod affects growth, behaviour and stress variables in Clarias gariepinus (2005) J Fish Biol, 67, pp. 1029-1039; Almeida, O.G., Kulczykowska, E., Oliveira, R.F., Changes in brain Arginine-vasotocin and Isotocin levels in dominants and subordinates males of cichlid fish.

Environmental enrichment (EE) has been proposed to minimize these effects. The vast number of methodological variations in animal studies underscores the lack of systematicity in the studies and the need for a detailed understanding of how enrichment interacts with other variables. Here we evaluate the effects of environmental enrichment in male and female Wistar rats exposed to adverse early life experiences (prenatal, postnatal, and combined) on emotional (elevated plus maze), social (social interaction chamber), memory (Morris water maze) and flexibility tasks. Our results—collected from PND 51 to 64—confirmed: 1) the positive effect of environmental enrichment (PND 28–49) on anxiety-like behaviors in animals submitted to ELSs. These effects depended on type of experience and type of enrichment: foraging enrichment reduced anxiety-like behaviors in animals with prenatal and postnatal stress but increased them in animals without ELSs. This effect was sex-dependent: females showed lower anxiety compared to males. Our data also indicated that females exposed to prenatal and postnatal stress had lower anxious responses than males in the same conditions; 2) no differences were found for social interactions; 3) concerning memory, there was a significant interaction between the three factors: A significant interaction for males with prenatal stress was observed for foraging enrichment, while physical enrichment was positive for males with postnatal stress; d) regarding cognitive flexibility, a positive effect of EE was found in animals exposed to adverse ELSs: animals with combined stress and exposed to physical enrichment showed a higher index of cognitive flexibility than those not exposed to enrichment. Yet, within animals with no EE, those exposed to combined stress showed lower flexibility than those exposed to both prenatal stress and no stress. On the other hand, animals with prenatal stress and exposed to foraging-type enrichment showed lower cognitive flexibility than those with no EE. The prenatal stress-inducing conditions used here 5) did not induced fetal or maternal problems and 6) did not induced changes in the volume of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

We briefly review the literature, and successively present the main results from our laboratory concerning the behavioral effects of prenatal stress, differential rearing conditions, and postnatal handling. We show that submitting primiparous DA/HAN rats to an acute emotional stress (exposure to a cat) at gestational day 10, 14, or 19 leads to greatly increased mortality of pups and to decreased body weight of surviving animals. The effects of such a stressor on emotional reactivity are less obvious. Cognitive processes are impaired depending on the learning task. Enriched environments restore abnormal behaviors (emotional reactivity, motor skills, motor and spatial learning) due to brain trauma or genetic deficiencies. In any case, environmental enrichment does prevent or slow down aging effects. The effects of postnatal handling noted when using classical tests of emotional reactivity also are clear when defensive reaction paradigms are used. Furthermore, pregnant females that are early handled are less anxious than nonhandled females. We hypothesize that, when subjected to a stressor, the offspring of early-handled females would be protected from the deleterious effects of this stress compared to pups of nonhandled females. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",B6CBA; BALB/c; C57BL/6; DA/HAN; Emotional reactivity; Enriched environment; Ethoexperimental approach; Handling; Learning; Lurcher; Prenatal stress,"animal behavior; animal experiment; anxiety; article; body weight; cat; cognition; controlled study; emotion; emotional stress; environmental enrichment; exploratory behavior; learning; maze test; mother child relation; motor development; nervous system development; nonhuman; postnatal development; pregnancy; prenatal development; rat; stress; survival rate; Animals; Arousal; Behavior, Animal; Cognition; Emotions; Female; Pregnancy; Rats; Rodentia; Time Factors; Animalia; Felis catus; Rodentia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamec, R., Transmitter systems involved in neural plasticity underlying increased anxiety and defense-Implications for understanding anxiety following traumatic stress (1997) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 21, pp. 755-765; Archer, J., Tests for emotionality in rats and mice: A review (1973) Animal Behaviour, 21, pp. 205-235; Archer, J.E., Blackman, D.E., Prenatal psychological stress and offspring behavior in rats and mice (1971) Developmental Psychobiology, 4, pp. 193-248; Barlow, S.M., Knight, A.F., Sullivan, F.M., Delay in postnatal growth and development of offspring produced by maternal restraint stress during pregnancy in the rat (1978) Teratology, 18, pp. 211-218; Bassett, J.R., Cairncross, K.D., Myocardial sensitivity to catecholamines following exposure of rats to irregular signaled foot shock (1976) Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior, 4, pp. 27-33; Batuev, A.S., Vinogradova, E.P., Polyakova, O.N., The effect of prenatal stress on rat offspring anxiety (1996) Zhurnal Vysshei Nervnoi Deiatelnosti Imeni I.

Maternal separation (MS) is a valid animal model of ELS that produces detrimental effects on brain and behavior of experimental animals. Positive environmental stimuli have been shown to counteract the behavioral deficits of ELS and enhance neuroplasticity. Recent data indicate that music may serve as a form of environmental enrichment in experimental animals. However, the underlying mechanisms through which musical enrichment exerts its effects are poorly understood. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were submitted to a 3 h MS protocol during postnatal days (PND) 2–14, while another group was left undisturbed. Half of the animals within each group were exposed from PND 21 to PND 76 for 12 h/day to Mozart K. 448. At approximately three months of age, elevated plus maze procedure, forced swim test and social approach task were applied to test whether music exposure can mitigate the effects of MS stress on animal emotional behaviors. Moreover, we investigated the effects of these treatments on dendritic spine density in the CA1 region of hippocampus. As expected, MS rats showed decreased sociability, increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and decreased mature dendritic spines in the CA1 region of hippocampus in adulthood. Musical enrichment reversed these effects. Our results suggest that musical enrichment can reverse the negative effects of MS on anxiety, depression, and sociability in adult rats and modulate neuronal plasticity and provide additional data for a new therapeutic intervention to rescue emotional symptoms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Early life stress; Enriched environment; Golgi-cox stain; Mozart music; Neuroplasticity; Spine formation,"adult; adulthood; animal experiment; animal model; anxiety; article; controlled study; dendritic spine; early life stress; environmental enrichment; female; forced swim test; Golgi stain; hippocampal CA1 region; male; maternal deprivation; music; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; animal; animal behavior; anxiety; anxiety disorder; brain; dendritic spine; depression; disease model; drug effect; exploratory behavior; hippocampus; mental stress; metabolism; music; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; newborn; physiology; psychology; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Dendritic Spines; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Disease Models, Animal; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Hippocampus; Male; Maternal Deprivation; Music; Neurogenesis; Neuronal Plasticity; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stress, Psychological",,,,,,This study was supported by the Department of Psychology and the Department of Biology of the University of Crete .,,,,,,,,,,"Heim, C., Newport, D.J., Mletzko, T., Miller, A.H., Nemeroff, C.B., The link between childhood trauma and depression: insights from HPA axis studies in humans (2008) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 33, pp. 693-710; Scott, K.M., Mclaughlin, K.A., Smith, D.A.R., Ellis, P.M., Childhood maltreatment and DSM-IV adult mental disorders: comparison of prospective and retrospective findings (2012) Br.

Such programs are designed to promote normal behavior, 280reduce stress, and improve NHPs’ ability to cope with stress, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the animals’ mental and physical health. Once considered “extra,” these programs are now a fundamental part of animal care. This progress is, in large part, a result of increased research efforts examining behavioral needs of NHPs and how these needs might be met in captivity. With Macaca being the most commonly used genus of NHP in biomedical research (Carlsson et al. 2004), a great deal of research has focused on finding optimal behavioral management strategies for macaque species. Such research has led to innovations in socialization and rearing strategies, identification of efficacious enrichment tools and techniques, and an increased understanding of the role of positive reinforcement training (PRT) in promoting welfare. Macaque behavioral managers now have a large toolbox of techniques they can utilize to improve captive welfare; however, the optimal strategies for any given program vary based on facility size, resources, and research goals. In this chapter, we discuss many of these behavioral management tools, including socialization, environmental enrichment, and PRT. We further provide our recommendations for a successful macaque behavioral management program, recognizing that limitations common to most primate facilities (e.g., funding, staff, time, etc.) often impact management decisions. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrews, M.W., Rosenblum, L.A., Effects of change in social content of video rewards on response patterns of bonnet macaques (2001) Learning and Motivation, 32 (4), pp. 401-408; Baker, K.C., Survey of 2014 behavioral management programs for laboratory primates in the United States (2016) American Journal of Primatology, 78, pp. 780-796; Baker, K.C., Bloomsmith, M., Neu, K., Positive reinforcement training moderates only high levels of abnormal behavior in singly housed rhesus macaques (2009) Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 12 (3), pp. 236-252; Baker, K.C., Bloomsmith, M.A., Oettinger, B., Benefits of pair housing are consistent across a diverse population of rhesus macaques (2012) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 137 (3-4), pp. 148-156; Baker, K.C., Bloomsmith, M.A., Oettinger, B., Comparing options for pair housing rhesus macaques using behavioral welfare measures (2014) American Journal of Primatology, 76, pp. 30-42; Baker, K.C., Crockett, C.M., Lee, G.H., Pair housing for female longtailed and rhesus macaques in the laboratory: Behavior in protected contact versus full contact (2012) Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 15 (2), pp. 126-143; Baker, K.C., Weed, J.L., Crockett, C.M., Survey of environmental enhancement programs for laboratory primates (2007) American Journal of Primatology, 69 (4), pp. 377-394; Bayne, K., Dexter, S., Mainzer, H., The use of artificial turf as a foraging substrate for individually housed rhesus monkeys (1992) (Macaca Mulatta).

Here, we extended this evidence by using a shorter postweaning rearing period (1 month) and including additional evaluations. First, in order to obtain a better characterization of the exploratory strategies among rearing conditions we analyzed in detail the spontaneous activity at the first minute and during the 10-min session. Second, we asked whether the changes in open-field activity were related with basal anxiety levels in the elevated plus-maze. Third, behavior in the forced-swimming test was analyzed and afterward, the tissue levels of hippocampal norepinephrine and serotonin were assessed. The possible relationship between neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behavior were explored through correlation analyses. We found that rearing conditions (i) differed on locomotor habituation and on sensory-motor exploration at the first minute and during the 10-min session without modifying the plus-maze behavior; (ii) affected differentially the grooming time, its sequential components, and the relationship between grooming and locomotor parameters; (iii) modified forced-swimming behavior and the hippocampal concentration of norepinephrine, serotonin, and its turnover; and (iv) produced different correlation patterns between both neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behaviors. Overall, environmental enrichment accelerated open-field habituation and led to behavioral and neurochemical antidepressant-like effects. In contract, isolation rearing strongly impaired habituation and simple information processing, but showed marginal effects on depressive-like behavior and on hippocampal neurochemistry. The current results suggest that differential rearing is not only a useful procedure to study behavioral plasticity or rigidity in response to early experience, but also to modeling some developmental protective or risk factors underlying depressive disorders. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The present study investigated alternative pathological mechanisms using a combination of multiple environmental approaches with biochemical and molecular tools. The aim of the present study was to evaluate blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity in socially manipulated animal housing conditions. Multiple environmentally related models were employed in the current study. The main model proposed (chronically isolated rats) was biochemically validated using the level of peripheral corticosterone. The current study examined and compared the mRNA levels of certain inflammatory and BBB markers in the hippocampal tissue of chronically isolated rats, including claudin 5 (cldn5) and tight junction protein (tjp). Animals were divided into four groups: I) Standard housed rats (controls); ii) chronically isolated rats; iii) control rats treated with fluoxetine, which is a standard selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; and iv) isolated rats treated with fluoxetine. To further examine the effect of environmental conditions on BBB markers, the current study assessed BBB markers in enriched environmental (EE) housing and short term isolation conditions. The results demonstrated a significant increase in cldn5 and tjp levels in the chronically isolated group. Despite some anomalous results, alterations in mRNA levels were further confirmed in EE housing conditions compared with chronically isolated rats. This trend was also observed in rats subjected to short term isolation compared with paired controls. Additionally, levels of IL 6, an inflammatory marker associated with neuroinflammation, were markedly increased in the isolated group. However, treatment with fluoxetine treat¬ment reversed these effects. The results indicated that BBB integrity may be compromised in stress related disorders, highlighting a need for further functional studies on the kinetics of BBB in stress related models. © 2020, Spandidos Publications.

However, due to different protocols of stimulation and measurement, the magnitude as well as the appearance of the startle response is inconsistent. New method: We postulate that the startle probability and not merely the amplitude may bare information that will form a consistent physiological measure of anxiety. Results: To examine the proof-of-concept of our suggested probability model, we evaluated the effects of acute (single) versus chronic (14 days) MPH administration on both startle amplitude and probability. We found that both acute and chronic MPH administration has yielded similar effects on startle amplitude. However, acute MPH increased the startle's probability while chronic MPH decreased it. Next, we evaluated the effects of acute versus chronic stress on the startle's parameters and found a complementary effect. Explicitly, acute stress increased the startle's probability while chronic stress increased the startle amplitude. In contrast, enriched environment had no significant effects. Finally, to further validate the probability measure, we show that Midazolam had significant anxiolytic effects. In the second part, we investigated the acoustic startle response parameters (e.g. background noise and pulse duration), to better understand the interplay between these parameters and the startle amplitude versus probability. Conclusions: We show that the probabilistic element of the startle response does not only point to deeper physiologic relationships but may also serve as “hidden variables” congruent but not entirely identical to the commonly researched amplitude of the startle response. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Amplitude; Methylphenidate; Midazolam; Probability; Startle response; Stress,"methylphenidate; midazolam; central stimulant agent; methylphenidate; acute stress; anxiety; Article; chronic stress; drug efficacy; elevated plus maze test; environment; male; nonhuman; priority journal; probability; rat; startle reflex; animal; drug effect; mental stress; pathophysiology; physiology; startle reflex; statistical model; Wistar rat; Animals; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Male; Methylphenidate; Models, Statistical; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reflex, Startle; Stress, Psychological",,"methylphenidate, 113-45-1, 298-59-9; midazolam, 59467-70-8; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Methylphenidate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abanoz, Y., Abanoz, Y., Gunduz, A., Uludag, M., Ornek, N.I., Uzun, N., Unalan, H., Kiziltan, M., Pattern of startle reflex to somatosensory stimuli changes after spinal cord injury (2016) J.

Environmental stress includes but not limited to being separated from dams, adapting to novel surroundings, struggling for rank and housing conditions. These factors interacting with genetic background can reduce the growth performance, decrease immune response and elevate cortisol concentration of an animal leading to compromised productivity in mass. This study was carried out so as to investigate the effects of different seasons on the growth performance, blood characteristics and immune responses in fattening pigs. Crossbred barrows of approximately 85 kg body weight were divided into 4 groups for each season (6 pigsx3 pensx4 seasons) and the diet was given for 4 weeks. The blood samples were collected from 4 pigs in each pen 2 h after the last feeding, the temperature inside was 23.8, 35.7, 22.1 and 11.8°C in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively when blood samples were collected. Summer significantly lowered (p<0.05) Average Daily Gain (ADG) and feed efficiency as well as concentrations of platelets, Immunoglobulin M (IgM), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) compared with other seasons. Summer also significantly increased (p<0.05) concentrations of leukocytes, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and cortisol compared with other seasons. Therefore, these results indicated that the different seasons enhanced growth performance, blood characteristics and immune responses and summer was more stressful than spring, autumn and winter in fattening pigs. © 2013 Academic Journals Inc.",Blood characteristics; Growth performance; Immune responses; Pigs; Seasons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arnone, M., Dantzer, R., Does frustration induce aggression in pigs?

Since it has been proposed that these changes might be permanent, we examined whether environmental complexity aid to recover the structural dendritic impairment induced by neonatal maternal deprivation in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat. In addition, the anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated plus-maze. Repeated maternal separation between postnatal days 6-21 (3 hours daily) significantly reduced the dendritic material in layer II/III pyramidal neurons and induced anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, environmental stimulation (twice a day, 1 h each) during 12 consecutive days (postnatal days 23-35) failed to recover the neuronal and behavioral disorders induced by neonatal maternal separation. The results demonstrated that (i) neonatal maternal separation severely altered pyramidal dendritic outgrowth in close association with anxiety-like behavior assessed in the elevated plus maze, and (ii) postweaning environmental complexity was unable to recover neither the prefrontocortical neuronal impairment nor the novelty-induced anxiety-like behavior triggered by early maternal deprivation.",Dendritic impairment; Elevated-plus maze; Environmental complexity; Maternal separation; Medial prefrontal cortex,"anxiety; article; behavior disorder; controlled study; dendritic cell; female; maternal deprivation; nonhuman; prefrontal cortex; pyramidal nerve cell; rat; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Anxiety; Dendrites; Environment; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Male; Maternal Deprivation; Maze Learning; Prefrontal Cortex; Pregnancy; Pyramidal Cells; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Weaning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andreatini, R., Bacellar, L.F.S., Animal models: Trait or state measure?

Here we describe a novel behavioral approach, which has enabled us to investigate similar affective biases in rodents. In our affective bias test (ABT), rats encounter two independent positive experiences-the association between food reward and specific digging substrate-during discrimination learning sessions. These are performed on separate days under either neutral conditions or during a pharmacological or affective state manipulation. Affective bias is then quantified using a preference test where both previously rewarded substrates are presented together and the rat's choices recorded. The absolute value of the experience is kept consistent and all other factors are counterbalanced so that any bias at recall can be attributed to treatment. Replicating previous findings from studies in healthy volunteers, we observe significant positive affective biases following acute treatment with typical (fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine) and atypical antidepressants (agomelatine, mirtazapine), and significant negative affective biases following treatment with drugs associated with inducing negative affective states in humans (FG7142, rimonabant, 13-cis retinoic acid). We also observed that acute psychosocial stress and environmental enrichment induce significant negative and positive affective biases, respectively, and provide evidence that these affective biases involve memory consolidation. The positive and negative affective biases induced in our test also mirror the antidepressant and pro-depressant effects of these drugs in patients suggesting our test has both translational and predictive validity. Our results suggest that cognitive affective biases could contribute to drug-or stress-induced mood changes in people and support the hypothesis that a cognitive neuropsychological mechanism contributes to antidepressant drug efficacy. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Increasing evidence has shown that the hippocampus, which is implicated in a range of cognitive functions, including learning and memory, is one of the most susceptible brain areas to the effects of enriched rearing. Recent work also suggests that the hippocampus is functionally segregated; lesion studies have shown that the dorsal hippocampus is important for spatial learning, whereas the ventral part is critical in emotional behaviour in rats. We investigated the effects of differential housing environments on anxiety-related behaviour and neurotrophin levels in dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and other brain regions. Ninety-six male and female C57BL/6 mice were reared in EC or standard housing condition (SC) for 4 months after weaning. Thereafter sixty-four animals were tested in the elevated plus-maze, open-field, novel-objects exploration and food neophobia. Thirty-two animals remained as untested. Subsequently, brain nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analysed in selected brain regions of the tested and non-tested animals. Differential housing influenced anxiety-related behaviour in the plus-maze and brain neurotrophins. Baseline levels of BDNF and NGF protein were differently distributed in dorsal and ventral parts of hippocampus in both male and female mice, with levels in the dorsal hippocampal being consistently higher than those in ventral hippocampus. Exposure to behavioural testing induced complex changes on neurotrophin levels in selected brain regions. This study demonstrates for the first time the differential distribution of normal levels of neurotrophin protein in dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice, and these levels can be affected by environmental enrichment and have an impact on emotional behaviour. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, compared to RLA/Verh rats, RLA/Verh rats are (behaviorally and physiologically) less anxious or reactive to stressors, show increased novelty (sensation)-seeking behaviour as well as a higher preference for rewarding substances, and are usually less efficient in learning tasks not involving shock administration. The present article reviews evidence showing that neonatal handling and/or environmental enrichment leads to enduring effects (their magnitude frequently depending upon the rat line) on those behaviors. For example, it has been found that neonatal handling reduces most of the (behavioral and physiological) signs of emotionality/anxiety in RLA/Verh rats, while environmental enrichment increases their novelty seeking (also the case with RHA/verh rats), saccharin and ethanol intake, and sensitivity to amphetamine. Finally, initial results (currently being further elaborated upon) support a preventive action of both environmental treatments on age-related impairments in learning a spatial, water maze task as well as on hippocampal neuronal atrophy.",Age-related deficit; Anxiety; Enriched environment; Hippocampus; Neonatal handling; Novelty/reward seeking; Reactivity to stress; Roman high- and low-avoidance rats; Spatial learning,"adolescent; aged; aging; alcohol consumption; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; avoidance behavior; brain atrophy; breeding; cognitive defect; controlled study; emotionality; environment; evolution; genetic selection; hippocampus; learning; maze test; newborn; newborn care; nonhuman; rat; reward; strain difference; stress; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Emotions; Environment; Exploratory Behavior; Handling (Psychology); Hippocampus; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Stress, Psychological; Animalia; Hippocampus hippocampus; Roman",,,,,"Comissió Interdepartamental de Recerca i Innovació Tecnològica, CIRIT: GRQ 94-2005",This work was supported by the FISss (95/1779) and CIRIT (GRQ 94-2005).

We analyzed adolescent vs. adult (mice) differences in the influence of EE on ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). The effects of these treatments on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the prefrontal cortex were examined in a separate group of animals. Ethanol-induced CPP was found in adults, and it was similar in EE and in animals reared under standard housing conditions (SC). Adolescents kept under EE, but not those in SC, exhibited CPP. Among SC, but not among EE, adolescents, BDNF levels were significantly lower in those treated with ethanol than in those given vehicle. These results indicate that, compared to adults, adolescent exhibited reduced sensitivity to ethanol's rewarding effects, yet the youth but not the adults exhibited sensitivity to the promoting effect of EE upon CPP by ethanol. Ethanol significantly reduced BDNF levels in adolescents reared under standard housing conditions, but not in adult mice nor in adolescents given EE housing conditions. The present results add to the plethora of adolescent-specific responses to ethanol or to environmental stimuli that may put the youth at risk for escalation of ethanol intake. © 2017 The Author(s).",,alcohol; brain derived neurotrophic factor; central depressant agent; age; animal; conditioning; depth perception; drinking behavior; drug effect; environment; metabolism; mouse; physiology; prefrontal cortex; reward; Age Factors; Alcohol Drinking; Animals; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Central Nervous System Depressants; Conditioning (Psychology); Environment; Ethanol; Mice; Prefrontal Cortex; Reward; Space Perception,,"alcohol, 64-17-5; brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Central Nervous System Depressants; Ethanol",,,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP: 470070/2012-9; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES: 2012/10260–7, 2015/02397-0; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCyT; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, FonCyT","This work was supported by a fellowship (Programa PVE CAPES) provided to RMP by CAPES, and by Grants 2012/10260–7, 2015/02397-0 São Paulo Research Foundation (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo - FAPESP), 470070/2012-9, National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - CNPq), PIP 2013–2015 Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) and PICT 2012-0436 Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (FONCyT).

Therefore, NHPs are usually a critical component in translational research projects aimed at developing therapeutics, vaccines, devices or other interventions aimed at preventing, curing or ameliorating human disease. NHPs are often used in conjunction with other animal models, such as rodents, and results obtained using NHPs must often be used as the final criterion for establishing the potential efficacy of a pharmaceutical or vaccine before transition to human clinical trails. In some cases, NHPs may be the only relevant animal models for a particlular translational study. This issue of the ILAR journal brings together, in one place, articles that discuss the use of NHP models for studying human diseases that are highly prevalent and that cause extraordinary human suffering and financial and social burdens. Topics covered in detail include: tuberculosis; viral hepatitis; HIV/AIDS; neurodegenerative disorders; Substance abuse disorders; vision and prevention of blindness; disorder associated with psychosocial processes, such as anxiety, depression and loneliness; cardiovascular disease; metabolic disease, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; respiratory disease; and female reproduction, prenatal development and women's health. Proper husbandry of NHPs that reduces stress and maintains animal health is critical for the development of NHP models. This issue of the journal includes a review of procedures for environmental enrichment, which helps assure animal health and wellbeing. Taken together, these articles provide detailed reviews of the use of NHP models for translational investigations and discuss successes, limitations, challenges and opportunities associated with this research. © The Author(s) 2017.

The website for the US National Primate Research Centers (NPRCs) includes short discussions of the use of NHPs to study several different diseases (https://www.nprcresearch.org). In response to a request by members of the US Congress, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a workshop in December of 2016 entitled, “NIH Workshop on Ensuring the Continued Responsible Oversight of Research with Nonhuman Primates.” The final report can be accessed at https://www.cnprc.ucdavis. edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NIH-NHP-Workshop-Report. pdf. This report contains brief comments on some aspects of the use of NHPs for translational research and concludes: “The NIH remains confident that the oversight framework for the use of nonhuman primates in research is robust and has provided sufficient protections to date.” A more detailed report published by the Scientific Committee on Health, the Environment and Emerging Risks of the European Union (The SCHEER Report) discusses the same conclusion from the European perspective, and, in addition, provides information about several aspects of the use of NHPs for translational research (SCHEER 2017).","I thank the many practitioners of NHP-based research with whom I had conversations over many years at the NIH.

Reports show that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is regulated by certain factors, such as exposure to an enriched environment, physical activity, aging and stress. The relationship between the change in the task of chewing as one oral environmental factor, and the mechanisms of hippocampal neuron generation are unclear. Objective: We examined whether cell proliferation varies by chewing tasks with different food textures in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus. Methods: Wistar rats were divided into two groups, one was fed a solid diet, known as the hard-diet feeding group, and the soft-diet feeding group, which was fed a powder diet containing the same components as the solid one for 3, 7, 16 and 24 weeks. Thymidine analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used as a marker of cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Results: The results of this study indicated that the total number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus significantly decreased with aging and were significantly fewer in the soft-diet feeding group than in hard-diet feeding group in 7-, 16- and 24-week-old rats after the BrdU injection. The change of BrdU-positive cell expression between soft and hard diets in 3- and 24-week-old rats was not observed in the olfactory bulb. Conclusion: It has been suggested that cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus is characteristically suppressed by soft diet feeding. Copyright © 2005 S.

Recent studies suggest beneficial effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on HD progression possibly through the serotonergic system. We investigated the potential effectiveness of EE in correcting the affective-like phenotype of female R6/1 HD mice. In addition to a behavioural battery of tests assessing depression and anxiety-related endophenotypes, we recorded physiological measures, including body temperature regulation and defecation rate as indices of stress reactivity. Finally, following identification of changes in serotonin (5-HT) receptor gene expression we measured the function of 5-HT1A auto- and hetero-receptors. We found that 8-week-old female HD mice exhibited higher immobility time in the forced swimming test and a decreased preference for saccharin solution. EE did not correct those depressive-like behaviours but reduced anxiety-related measures in unconditioned approach/avoidance conflict situations. Defecation rate in a large open field and change in temperature during exposure to the tail suspension test were both enhanced in HD compared to wild-type animals. Despite the enhanced hypothermic response to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT exhibited by HD mice, we found a reduction in 5-HT1A receptor-mediated stimulation of [35S]GTP-γ-S binding in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the hippocampus of HD animals. EE did not change 5-HT1A receptor function. Our data suggest that early EE has beneficial effects on the anxiety-like, but not on depression-like, behaviours in HD. This is the first evidence that these affective endophenotypes can be dissociated via this form of environmental stimulation. As 5-HT1A receptor dysfunction was not affected by EE, this receptor is unlikely to underlie the anxiety-related phenotype of HD. However, the specific regulatory role of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor in mediating depressive-like behaviour in HD remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, by comparing in vivo and in vitro results, our findings suggest that 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia could be mediated by other targets besides the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, including hippocampal 5-HT7 receptors. © 2012 The Physiological Society.",,"2 dipropylamino 8 hydroxytetralin;

Animals were divided into the following groups: control, control + EE, meningitis, and meningitis + EE. EE began at 21 days and continued until 60 days of age (adulthood). EE consisted of a large cage with three floors, ramps, running wheels, and objects of different shapes and textures. At 60 days, animals were randomized and subjected to habituation to the open-field task and the step-down inhibitory avoidance task. After the tasks, the hippocampus and CSF were isolated for analysis.Results: The meningitis group showed no difference in performance between training and test sessions of the open-field task, suggesting habituation memory impairment; in the meningitis + EE group, performance was significantly different, showing preservation of habituation memory. In the step-down inhibitory avoidance task, there were no differences in behavior between training and test sessions in the meningitis group, showing aversive memory impairment; conversely, differences were observed in the meningitis + EE group, demonstrating aversive memory preservation. In the two meningitis groups, IL-4, IL-10, and BDNF levels were increased in the hippocampus, and BDNF levels in the CSF.Conclusions: The data presented suggest that EE, a non-invasive therapy, enables recovery from memory deficits caused by neonatal meningitis. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Psiquiatria.",BDNF; Cytokines; Environmental enrichment; Pneumococcal meningitis,"brain derived neurotrophic factor; ceftriaxone; chemokine; cytokine; cytokine induced neutrophil chemoattractant; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor alpha; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cytokine; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cerebrospinal fluid; cerebrospinal fluid culture; cognitive defect; controlled study; environmental enrichment; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; experimental behavioral test; fluid therapy; hippocampus; male; memory; memory disorder; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; open field test; pneumococcal meningitis; rat; somatosensory stimulation; Streptococcus pneumoniae; training; animal; blood; brain; Cognition Disorders; convalescence; disease model; environmental exposure; evaluation study; Memory Disorders; Meningitis, Pneumococcal; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; pathophysiology; physiology; reproducibility; treatment outcome; Wistar rat; Animals; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cognition Disorders; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Environmental Exposure; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Male; Memory Disorders; Meningitis, Pneumococcal; Neurogenesis; Neuronal Plasticity; Rats, Wistar; Recovery of Function; Reproducibility of Results; Treatment Outcome",,"brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; cytokine induced neutrophil chemoattractant, 124147-28-0; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cytokines",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kim, K.S., Acute bacterial meningitis in infants and children (2010) Lancet Infect Dis, 10, pp. 32-42; Grandgirard, D., Leib, S.L., Meningitis in neonates: Bench to bedside (2010) Clin Perinatol, 37, pp. 655-676; Ramakrishnan, M., Ulland, A.J., Steinhardt, L.C., Moisi, J.C., Were, F., Levine, O.S., Sequelae due to bacterial meningitis among African children: A systematic literature review (2009) BMC Med, 7, p. 47; Sellner, J., Täuber, M.G., Leib, S.L., Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of bacterial CNS infections (2010) Handbook of Clinical Neurology, pp. 1-16. , In: Karen LR, Allan RT, editors, New York: Elsevier; Koppe, U., Suttorp, N., Opitz, B., Recognition of Streptococcus pneumoniae by the innate immune system (2012) Cell Microbiol, 14, pp. 460-466; Barichello, T., Generoso, J.S., Milioli, G., Elias, S.G., Teixeira, A.L., Pathophysiology of bacterial infection of the central nervous system and its putative role in the pathogenesis of behavioral changes (2013) Rev Bras Psiquiatr, 35, pp. 81-87; Klein, M., Koedel, U., Pfister, H.W., Oxidative stress in pneumococcal meningitis: A future target for adjunctive therapy?

Not only are actions imitated, but they may also be reapplied in variable future situations, suggesting an explicit knowledge of the purpose of the behaviours. Social learning thus enables animals to learn about their complex environments rapidly and efficiently, aiding survival. However, little is known of the processes underlying information transmission and the complexity of information that can be exchanged. We used shoals of guppies to investigate how animals decide which individual to copy, and the extent of information that can be transferred. Naïve guppies followed the first fish to move. However, although the speed and accuracy of foraging increased significantly during training, the first fish to move was not always the trained (knowledgeable) guppy. No significant difference was found between the number of guppies entering areas of varying food quality, supporting the hypothesis that these fish learn foraging locations by following and suggesting that leaders forage without considering the reduced personal reward arising from sharing a low-quality patch with followers. Animals that learn by copying thus appear limited in the amount of information they can receive, highlighting a selection pressure for more extensive means of transmitting information in complex environments. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Boldness; Dominance; Guppy; Information transfer; Poecilia reticulata; Social foraging,cyprinid; dominance; foraging behavior; freshwater ecosystem; future prospect; social behavior; Animalia; Cyprinodontiformes; Poecilia reticulata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrahams, M.V., Foraging guppies and the ideal free distribution: the influence of information on patch choice (1989) Ethology, 82, pp. 116-126; Benskin, C.M.W.H., Mann, N.I., Lachlan, R.F., Slater, P.J.B., Social learning directs feeding preferences in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata (2002) Animal Behaviour, 64, pp. 823-828; Brown, G.E., Godin, J.G.J., Chemical alarm signals in wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) (1999) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77, pp. 562-570; Brown, G.E., Godin, J.G.J., Pedersen, J., Fin-flicking behaviour: a visual antipredator alarm signal in a characin fish, Hemigrammus erythrozonus (1999) Animal Behaviour, 58, pp. 469-475; Bumann, D., Krause, J., Rubenstein, D., Mortality risk of spatial positions in animal groups: the danger of being in the front (1997) Behaviour, 134, pp. 1063-1076; Croft, D.P., Krause, J., James, R., Social networks in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 271, pp. S516-S519; Curio, E., Ernst, U., Vieth, W., Adaptive significance of avian mobbing .2.

It ensures housing of laboratory animals in environments with space and complexity that enable the expression of their normal behavioral repertoire. Auditory enrichment by exposure to classical music decreases abnormal behaviors and endocrine stress responses in humans, non-humans primates, and rodents. However, little is known about the role of auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish. Given the growing importance of zebrafish for neuroscience research, such studies become critical. To examine whether auditory enrichment by classical music can affect fish behavior and physiology, we exposed adult zebrafish to 2 h of Vivaldi's music (65-75 dB) twice daily, for 15 days. Overall, zebrafish exposed to such auditory stimuli were less anxious in the novel tank test and less active, calmer in the light-dark test, also affecting zebrafish physiological (immune) biomarkers, decreasing peripheral levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the activity of some CNS genes, without overt effects on whole-body cortisol levels. In summary, we report that twice-daily exposure to continuous musical sounds may provide benefits over the ongoing 50-55 dB background noise of equipment in the laboratory setting. Overall, our results support utilizing auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish to reduce stress and improve welfare in this experimental aquatic organism. © 2018 Barcellos et al.",Anxiety; Auditory enrichment; Exploratory behavior; Fish welfare; Immune genes; Stress,brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; complementary DNA; gamma interferon; hydrocortisone; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; tumor necrosis factor; adult; animal experiment; anxiety; Article; auditory stimulation; behavior; controlled study; DNA extraction; experimental behavioral test; female; gene expression; light-dark test; male; mRNA expression level; nervous system inflammation; noise; nonhuman; physiology; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; sound; stress; zebra fish,,"gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hydrocortisone, 50-23-7",,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 16-04-00851; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 301992/2014-2, 307900/2016-9; Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Econômico, Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação, SDECTI","The following grant information was disclosed by the authors: Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Econômico, Ciência e Tecnologia (SDECT).

Although none of the specific brain circuits has been identified yet, research including neuroimaging, post mortem studies and animal models has pointed out important regions for the physiopathology of the disease. At the same time, some neuronal processes including the stress response, the immune response, the synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity involved in the physiopatology of depression have been identified. So, several neurohormonal, neuronal and neurotrophic processes have been intensely studied in order to understand the onset and progression of depression. Among these, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the monoaminergic transmission, the neurotrophic mechanisms, neurogenesis and cytokines have been studied as important factors in depression. Recent research suggests that environment exerts a determining effect on the function of these processes. Adverse events during early development stages are able to modify gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, becoming important factors of susceptibility. On the other hand, enriched environments also modify several neurological processes, acquiring an important role in the development of the disease.",Cytokines; Depression; Environment; Epigenetics; Genetics;

A new nanoporous material, namely, magnetically covalent organic polymer (MCOP, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-COP) was synthesized in this work and was used for magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE). The combination of MSPE with high-performance liquid chromatography separation together with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) was established as an effective method for the determination of four sulfonamide (SA) residues in surface water surrounding a cattle farm. The synthesized magnetic material was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, magnetic properties measurement system (MPMS), and nitrogen gas porosimetry. The material possessed many attractive features, such as a unique microporous structure, a larger specific surface area (137.93 m2·g-1) than bare Fe3O4 (24.84 m2·g-1), high saturation magnetization (50.5 emu·g-1), open adsorption sites, and high stability. The influencing parameters, including pH, the used amount of MCOPs, the type of eluent, adsorption solution, and desorption time, were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the method conferred good linearity ranges (R2 ≥ 0.9990), low detection limits (S/N = 3, LOD, 0.10-0.25 μg·L-1), and satisfactory recoveries (79.7% to 92.2%). The enrichment factor (EF) for the four SAs was 34.13-38.86. The relative standard deviations of intraday (n = 5) and of interday (n = 3) were less than 4.8% and 8.9%, respectively. The equilibria between extraction and desorption for SAs could be reached within 150 s. The proposed method was sensitive and convenient for detecting SA residues in complex environmental matrices, and the successful application of the new MCOPs as an adsorbent was demonstrated. © 2022 Yuqin Yang et al.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arroyo-Manzanares, N., Gámiz-Gracia, L., García-Campaña, A.M., Alternative sample treatments for the determination of sulfonamides in milk by HPLC with fluorescence detection (2014) Food Chemistry, 143, pp. 459-464. , 2-s2.0-84884550004;

This three-step randomised controlled trial in male C57BL/6 mice investigated the effect of supplementing the environment with one or more hemp ropes. In part 1, the effect of a hemp rope on aggressive and social behaviour, stress and anxiety levels was assessed by social interaction test, elevated plus maze behaviour, and faecal corticosterone metabolites, respectively (n = 224 mice). In part 2, the effect of 1, 2 or 7 hemp ropes on aggressive behaviour in mice subjected to routine handling was evaluated by assessing the number of wounded companion animals and wounds per animal (n = 224). In part 3, climbing activity in the rope and amount of material shredded from the rope was assessed (n = 56). Mice housed with one hemp rope engaged in social behaviour for longer time than mice housed without a hemp rope, while no difference was detected in stress and anxiety levels. No difference was seen in the number of wounded animals or wounds per animal when adding 1, 2 or 7 hemp ropes to the existing environment in mice undergoing minimal human handling. The mice continuously shredded and climbed the rope, even when provided with a new rope, although time spent climbing decreased slightly over time. Thus, a hemp rope can be used as additional environmental enrichment amongst male C57BL/6 mice. © 2017 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Aggression; Animal welfare; Environmental enrichment; Mice; Stress; Wounds,corticosterone; aggression; animal experiment; animal model; animal welfare; anxiety; Article; C57BL/6N mouse; climbing; controlled study; elevated plus maze test; environmental enrichment; female; hemp rope; male; mouse; nonhuman; social behavior; social interaction; stress; wound,,"corticosterone, 50-22-6",,,,"This project was funded by CALAR, Centre of Applied Laboratory Animal Research.

We address the management of several feeding issues that cat owners may face, such as obesity, pickiness, begging for food, and feeding in multi-cat households. Food puzzles are one way to provide environmental enrichment for cats, and food can be used in multiple ways for behavior modification in the clinical setting, including counterconditioning and differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Domestic cats; Feeding behavior; Food puzzles; Foraging; Mental health; Predation,"animal behavior; animal hunting; anticipation; behavior assessment; behavior change; behavior therapy; body weight; cat; counterconditioning therapy; domestic animal; emotion; food fussiness; food preference; food-seeking behavior; foraging behavior; generalized anxiety disorder; hunger; impulsiveness; mental health; nonhuman; obesity; Review; separation anxiety; social interaction; veterinary behavior therapy; wellbeing; animal; animal food; cat; nutritional requirement; physiology; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cats; Nutritional Requirements",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: TL1 TR001861; Maddie's Fund; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS: UL1TR001860","Dr. Delgado was supported by funding from Maddie’s Fund and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through grant number UL1 TR001860 and linked award TL1 TR001861 to MD.

A major challenge in conducting conditioning studies in humans is the ability to strongly manipulate or simulate the environmental contexts that are associated with conditioned emotional behaviors. In this regard, virtual reality (VR) technology is a promising tool. Yet, adapting this technology to meet experimental constraints requires special accommodations. Here we address the methodological issues involved when conducting fear conditioning in a fully immersive 6-sided VR environment and present fear conditioning data. In the real world, traumatic events occur in complex environments that are made up of many cues, engaging all of our sensory modalities. For example, cues that form the environmental configuration include not only visual elements, but aural, olfactory, and even tactile. In rodent studies of fear conditioning animals are fully immersed in a context that is rich with novel visual, tactile and olfactory cues. However, standard laboratory tests of fear conditioning in humans are typically conducted in a nondescript room in front of a flat or 2D computer screen and do not replicate the complexity of real world experiences. On the other hand, a major limitation of clinical studies aimed at reducing (extinguishing) fear and preventing relapse in anxiety disorders is that treatment occurs after participants have acquired a fear in an uncontrolled and largely unknown context. Thus the experimenters are left without information about the duration of exposure, the true nature of the stimulus, and associated background cues in the environment. In the absence of this information it can be difficult to truly extinguish a fear that is both cue and context-dependent. Virtual reality environments address these issues by providing the complexity of the real world, and at the same time allowing experimenters to constrain fear conditioning and extinction parameters to yield empirical data that can suggest better treatment options and/or analyze mechanistic hypotheses. In order to test the hypothesis that fear conditioning may be richly encoded and context specific when conducted in a fully immersive environment, we developed distinct virtual reality 3-D contexts in which participants experienced fear conditioning to virtual snakes or spiders. Auditory cues co-occurred with the CS in order to further evoke orienting responses and a feeling of ""presence"" in subjects. Skin conductance response served as the dependent measure of fear acquisition, memory retention and extinction. © 2010 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",,,,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: F32MH078471; National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA: R01DA027802",,,,,,,,,,,"Mineka, S., Zinbarg, R., A contemporary learning theory perspective on the etiology of anxiety disorders: It's not what you thought it was (2006) Amer.

These convulsions occur due to abnormally increased signalling of interleukin-1 beta, resulting in increased neuronal hyper-excitability. Furthermore, exposure to prenatal stress has been shown to exacerbate seizure duration, elicit anxiety-like behaviour and corticosterone levels. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide with anxiolytic, social bonding, and stress regulation effects. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess whether oxytocin can attenuate the anxiety-like behaviour and increased corticosterone in rat offspring exposed to prenatal stress and FS. Method: Sprague Dawley rats were mated. On GND14, prenatal stress was induced on pregnant dams for 1 hr/7 days. On PND 14, rat pups were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 200 μg/kg, i.p.) followed 2.5 h later by an i.p. injection of kainic acid (KA, 1.75 mg/kg). Oxytocin (1 mg/kg) was induced via different routes (intraperitoneal or intranasal) as well an enriched environment between PND 22–26. The enriched environment included larger cages (1560 cm2) with only 4 pups per cage, compared to those groups not receiving enrichment (646 cm2), as well as cardboard rolls and plastic toys. On PND 27–33 the light/dark box and elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behaviour. On PND 34 all rats were euthanized using a sharp guillotine, trunk blood and hypothalamic tissue were collected for neurochemical analysis (ELISA kit). Results: Our findings confirmed that exposure to both prenatal stress and febrile seizures resulted anxiety-like behaviour and significantly higher plasma corticosterone concentrations compared to their counterparts. Environmental enrichment was significantly effective in attenuating the increased basal corticosterone levels and anxiety-like behaviour seen in the prenatally stressed FS rat. Although direct administration of oxytocin showed higher significance in reducing corticosterone plasma levels when compared to the enriched environment. Furthermore, hypothalamic oxytocin levels were not significant in rat exposed to environmental enrichment while oxytocin treatment showed a significant effect when compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: Therefore, oxytocin administration during early postnatal development shows great potential in reversing the effects of prenatal stress and its subsequent exacerbation of FS. © 2022 The Authors",Anxiety; Corticosterone; Environmental enrichment; Febrile seizures; Oxytocin; Prenatal stress,anxiolytic agent; corticosterone; interleukin 1beta; kainic acid; lipopolysaccharide; neuropeptide; oxytocin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety; Article; autopsy; behavioral synchrony; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; disease exacerbation; elevated plus maze test; environmental enrichment; environmental exposure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; estrus cycle; febrile convulsion; female; hypothalamic tissue; male; nonhuman; postnatal development; pregnancy; prenatal stress; rat; social bonding; training,,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; kainic acid, 487-79-6; oxytocin, 50-56-6, 54577-94-5",,"Sigma Aldrich, United StatesElabscience, China","Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences, PCHS; Inyuvesi Yakwazulu-Natali, UKZN","This work is based on the research supported in part by the University of KwaZulu-Natal , College of Health Sciences.",,,,,,,,,,"Blier, P., De Montigny, C., Serotonin and drug-induced therapeutic responses in major depression, obsessive–compulsive and panic disorders (1999) Neuropsychopharmacology, 21, pp. 91S-98S; Blume, A., Bosch, O.J., Miklos, S., Torner, L., Wales, L., Waldherr, M., Neumann, I.D., Oxytocin reduces anxiety via ERK1/2 activation: local effect within the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (2008) Eur.

But here we studied the possibility whether the pre-exposure of enriched environment might affect the behavioral deficits produced as a post-treatment to chronic restraint stress. Behavioral parameters, associated with chronic stress such as depression, anxiety and memory were monitored before and after stress treatment, in socially enriched and socially non-enriched conditions. According to the results the rats that were pre-exposed to socially enriched conditions indicated an anti-depressive and anxiolytic activity after repeated stress procedure as compared to the rats of socially non-enriched environment. Furthermore, improvement and retention of short term and long term memory was observed in enriched rats before and after restraint stress procedure. This study can be related to the beneficial role of earlier exposure to enriched environment that may affect the behaviors related to response of brain to stress stimuli and prevention of behavioral deficits that may lead to various psychological abnormalities that are related to prolonged stress exposures. © 2017 PVJ.",Anxiety;

Concurrently, in a high (HAB) and low (LAB) trait anxiety mouse model, Tmem132d was found to show increased expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) of HAB as compared to LAB mice. To understand the molecular underpinnings underlying the differential expression, we sequenced the gene and found two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter differing between both lines which could explain the observed mRNA expression profiles using gene reporter assays. In addition, there was no difference in basal DNA methylation in the CpG Island that encompasses the HAB vs. LAB Tmem132d promoter region. Furthermore, we found significantly higher binding of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) to the proximal HAB-specific SNP (rs233264624) than the corresponding LAB locus in an oligonucleotide pull-down assay, suggesting increased transcription. Virus mediated overexpression of Tmem132d in the aCC of C57BL/6 J mice could confirm its role in mediating an anxiogenic phenotype. To model gene-environmental interactions, HAB mice exposed to enriched environment (HAB-EE) responded with decreased anxiety levels but, had enhanced Tmem132d mRNA expression as compared to standard-housed HAB (HAB-SH) mice. While LAB mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (LAB-UCMS) exhibited higher anxiety levels and had lower mRNA expression compared to standard-housed LAB (LAB-SH) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed significantly higher binding of POLR2A to rs233264624 in HAB-EE, while LAB-UCMS had lower POLR2A binding at this locus, thus explaining the enhanced or attenuated expression of Tmem132d compared to their respective SH controls. To further investigate gene-environment interactions, DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina 450 K BeadChip in 74 panic disorder patients. Significant methylation differences were observed in two CpGs (cg26322591 and cg03283235) located in TMEM132D depending on the number of positive life events supporting the results of an influence of positive environmental cues on regulation of Tmem132d expression in mice. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"genomic DNA; messenger RNA; RNA polymerase II; membrane protein; RNA polymerase II; allele; animal experiment; animal model; anterior cingulate; anxiety disorder; Article; chromatin immunoprecipitation; CpG island; DNA methylation; exon; gene; gene control; gene expression; genotype environment interaction; heterozygote; intron; mouse; nonhuman; panic; promoter region; single nucleotide polymorphism; TMEM132D gene; animal; animal behavior; anxiety; brain; C57BL mouse; disease model; female; genetics; genotype environment interaction; male; metabolism; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animals; Anxiety; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic; RNA Polymerase II",,Membrane Proteins; RNA Polymerase II,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gross, C., Hen, R., The developmental origins of anxiety (2004) Nat.

However, there is still little information about the molecular underpinnings of these effects on rats subjected to experimental models of depression. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of EE on rats exposed to the learned helplessness paradigm (LH), a well-known model of the disease. We found that a 21 day exposure to EE reverts helplessness behavior to normal in LH animals. Inmunohistochemical labeling showed that this effect was accompanied by normalization of two structural proteins of hippocampal neurons to control values: the light neurofilament subunit (NFL) and the postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) protein, which were decreased in LH animals housed in standard cages. The decrease in the presynaptic protein synaptophysin (SYN) observed in LH animals remained unchanged after exposure to EE. There was no increase in neurogenesis as measured by quantification of double-labeled cells with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and the neuronal marker β-tubulin class III. These results show that EE may have behavioral and synaptic effects on animals exposed to an experimental model of depression, and that such actions seem to be independent from neurogenesis. © 2009 IBRO.",cytoskeleton; major depression; plasticity; stress; synaptogenesis,"beta tubulin; broxuridine; neurofilament protein; postsynaptic density protein 95; synaptophysin; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; brain nerve cell; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytoskeleton; depression; environmental enrichment; hippocampus; image analysis; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; learning; male; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; synapse; Animals; Bromodeoxyuridine; Cytoskeleton; Depressive Disorder; Disease Models, Animal; Environment, Controlled; Exploratory Behavior; Helplessness, Learned; Hippocampus; Immunohistochemistry; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Membrane Proteins; Neurofilament Proteins; Neurogenesis; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Synapses; Synaptic Transmission; Synaptophysin; Tubulin",,"beta tubulin, 87090-36-6; broxuridine, 59-14-3; Bromodeoxyuridine, 59-14-3; Dlgh4 protein, rat; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Neurofilament Proteins; Synaptophysin; Tubulin; neurofilament protein L",,,"Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET: PIP 5870; Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCyT: PICT 11102, PICT 31953; Universidad de Buenos Aires, UBA; Secretaría de Ciencia y Técnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, UBACyT: M 013, M 073","We wish to thank Dr. D.

Mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) have been identified as clear etiological factors in more than 90% of classical RTT cases. Whereas the mechanisms leading to the severe, progressive and specific neurological dysfunctions when this gene is mutated still remain to be elucidated, a series of different mouse models have been generated, bearing different Mecp2 mutation. Neurobehavioural analysis in these mouse lines have been carried out and phenotyping analysis can be now utilised to preclinically evaluate the effects of potential RTT treatments. This review summarizes the different results achieved in this research field taking into account different key targets identified to ameliorate RTT phenotype in mouse models, including those not directly downstream of MeCP2 and those limited to the early phases of postnatal development.

Published studies of rats, mice and other rodents were reviewed to document behavioural and psychological problems attributable to predominant laboratory housing conditions. Studies indicate that rats and mice value opportunities to take cover, build nests, explore, gain social contact, and exercise some control over their social milieu, and that the inability to satisfy these needs is physically and psychologically detrimental, leading to impaired brain development and behavioural anomalies (e.g. stereotypies). To the extent that space is a means to gain access to such resources, spatial confinement likely exacerbates these deficits. Adding environmental 'enrichments' to small cages reduces but does not eliminate these problems, and I argue that substantial changes in housing and husbandry conditions would be needed to further reduce them. © Laboratory Animals Ltd.",Enrichment; Housing; Laboratory; Mice; Rats; Stereotypies,"animal behavior; animal housing; anxiety; biology; brain development; data base; environment; environmental factor; experimental animal; gnawing; mental health; neuroanatomy; nonhuman; physiology; psychologic assessment; psychological well being; psychology; publication; review; social behavior; social class; stereotypy; stress; Animal Welfare; Animals; Animals, Laboratory; Behavior, Animal; Female; Housing, Animal; Male; Mice; Rats; Social Environment; Rodentia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baumans, V., Stafleu, F.R., Bouw, J., Testing housing system for mice - The value of a preference test (1987) Zeitschrift fur Versuchstierkunde, 29, pp. 9-14; Bayne, K., Potential for unintended consequences of environmental enrichment for laboratory animals and research results (2005) ILAR Journal, 46, pp. 129-139; (2000) The Smile of a Dolphin: Remarkable Accounts of Animal Emotions, , Bekoff M, ed.

We used this culture system to define the cytokine environment in which human OC form and to determine the separate contributions of the stromal and hematopoietic elements. We designed a panel of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers that specifically amplify the respective murine or human mRNA species that correspond to cytokines and their cognate receptors previously shown to promote or inhibit OC differentiation. ST-2 cells were cocultured with human PBMC for up to 21 days in the presence of 1α,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, dexamethasone, and recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). OC formation was monitored by the appearance of cells that were positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and able to form resorption lacunae on slices of dentine. We found that the ST-2 cells in these cultures express messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding a repertoire of many of the reported osteoclastogenic factors (interleukins [IL]-1/IL-1R1, IL-11, IL-6/IL-6R, and IL-17 transforming growth factor [TGF]-β), as well as the recently described OC differentiation factor (ODF/TRANCE/RANKL). The stromal cells also expressed mRNA encoding two molecules shown to be inhibitory to osteoclastogenesis, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and IL-18. OPG, IL-1, IL-1R1, IL-6, IL-6R, IL-11R, IL-17, IL-18, IL-18R, TGF-β, and M-CSF were expressed by both the stromal cells and the PBMC. Expression of mRNA encoding RANK, IL-1R2, and c-fms, was specific for the PBMC. In addition, PBMC were found to express sIL-6R, granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF, GM-CSFRα, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Whereas this indicated that human OC formation occurs in a complex environment of many positive and negative influences, we identified three apparent features of the cytokine environment that may be a characteristic of normal osteoclast formation. First, the ratio of mouse ODF:OPG mRNA was found to increase during the cocultures, consistent with a key role for ODF in the promotion by stromal cells of OC formation. Second, we found that mRNA encoding IL-1 and IL-17, as well as IL-6 and sIL-6R, were coordinately expressed by the PBMC. Third, analysis of the culture medium showed that the PBMC secreted IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α protein only in coculture with ST-2 cells during the first few days of osteoclast development. We conclude that human OC formation occurs in a complex environment of many positive and negative influences; however, these are likely to be strictly regulated by a coordinated cytokine response of both stromal and hematopoietic cells.

The notion that an impairment in BDNF signaling might be involved in affective disorders is originated primarily from the opposing effects of antidepressants and stress on BDNF signaling. Antidepressants enhance BDNF signaling and synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, negative environmental factors such as severe stress suppress BDNF signaling, impair synaptic activity and increase susceptibility to affective disorders. Postmortem studies provided strong support for decreased BDNF signaling in depressive disorders. Remarkably, studies in humans with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene, the BDNF Val66Met which affects regulated release of BDNF, showed profound deficits in hippocampal and prefrontal cortical (PFC) plasticity and cognitive behaviors. BDNF regulates synaptic mechanisms responsible for various cognitive processes including attenuation of aversive memories, a key process in the regulation of affective behaviors. The unique role of BDNF in cognitive and affective behaviors suggests that cognitive deficits due to altered BDNF signaling might underlie affective disorders. Understanding how BDNF modulates synapses in neural circuits relevant to affective behaviors, particularly the medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC)-hippocampus-amygdala pathway, and its interaction with development, sex, and environmental risk factors might shed light on potential therapeutic targets for affective disorders.

This appears to be driven by complex environmental changes, including microbial exposure, diet, and pollutants, which are known to modify immune development in early life, beginning in pregnancy. The first models showing possible epigenetic mechanisms for these effects are beginning to emerge. This review focuses on recent advances in our knowledge of the consequent effects on postnatal immune development, highlighting recognized differences in children with and without allergies. Although we characterized essential differences in longitudinal T-cell development more than 10 years ago, new technologies using whole genome microarrays are now being used to examine for differential gene expression in T cells from individuals with allergies. We have also recently performed the first comprehensive study of the longitudinal development of innate toll-like receptor responses in children with and without allergies during the first 5 years of life, identifying significant differences in these pathways as well. Finally, although there are preliminary differences in regulatory T-cell function at birth, longitudinal studies are limited by difficulties isolating these cells in sufficient numbers from young children for functional studies. Thymic tissue isolated during cardiac surgery is a rich source of regulatory T-cell function in children and may provide further avenues for assessing differences in maturation of these cells in individuals with allergies. To further understand the pathogenesis of these altered patterns of immune response, future research needs to encompass the complexity of gene-environmental interactions, which confer individual susceptibility to environmental exposures.

In addition to reducing the size and complexity of the dendritic tree, stress and elevated glucocorticoid levels are known to inhibit adult neurogenesis. Despite the negative effects of stress hormones on progenitor cell proliferation in the hippocampus, some experiences which produce robust increases in glucocorticoid levels actually promote neuronal growth. These experiences, including running, mating, enriched environment living, and intracranial self-stimulation, all share in common a strong hedonic component. Taken together, the findings suggest that rewarding experiences buffer progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus from the negative effects of elevated stress hormones. This chapter considers the evidence that stress and glucocorticoids inhibit neuronal growth along with the paradoxical findings of enhanced neuronal growth under rewarding conditions with a view toward understanding the underlying biological mechanisms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Anxiety;

Treatments such as enriched environment, dietary restriction, running and anti-depressants increase proliferation, however, stress and opiates have been shown to decrease proliferation. While models of binge ethanol drinking decreases proliferation, few studies have characterized the effect chronic ethanol usage has on progenitor cell proliferation. In this study, we have examined changes in the progenitor cell proliferation rate following chronic ethanol consumption. Animals were given a nutritionally balanced liquid diet containing 6.5% v/v ethanol or an isocalorically balanced liquid diet. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered (150 mg/kg×3) and the animals sacrificed 2 h after the last injection on days 3, 10 or 30 of the ethanol diet. Coronal brain blocks were paraffin embedded and 6 μm sections sliced and immunohistochemically stained for BrdU. Quantitation of the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the subgranular zone of the DG revealed a significant decrease only at the 3-day time-point, with recovery by the 10- and 30-day time-points. Thus, the progenitor cell proliferation rate is transiently decreased by chronic ethanol usage. This data suggests that chronic alcohol use results in a compensatory response that restores the progenitor cell proliferation rate. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods and results: The detection limit of two newly designed SYBR Green real-time PCR assays for mcr-4 and mcr-5 and of previously published protocols for mcr-1 to mcr-3 was assessed using serial dilutions of reference strains. The assays could detect all five mcr genes with the lower limit of 102 copy numbers. Escherichia coli isolates (n = 1062) and environmental samples (n = 93) were tested for the presence of mcr genes. The assays enabled the detection of colistin resistance genes both in bacterial isolates and in complex environmental samples. Conclusions: This method represents a set of sensitive, rapid and effective assays for the screening of colistin resistance directly from the environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: Colistin is an antimicrobial commonly used in animals and has recently emerged as a last-resort treatment in humans. Plasmid-mediated mcr genes confer resistance to colistin and represent a major threat for public health since they can be easily disseminated through horizontal gene transfer. The rapid and sensitive detection of mcr genes is of utmost necessity. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology",antimicrobials; detection; E. coli (all potentially pathogenic types); environmental; resistance,"bacterial DNA; beta lactamase AmpC; colistin; extended spectrum beta lactamase; genomic DNA; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; colistin; antibiotics; bioassay; coliform bacterium; detection method; dilution; gene; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; agar gel electrophoresis; amplicon; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium colony; colistin resistance; computer model; controlled study; cross reaction; Escherichia coli; genetic screening; limit of quantitation; manure; mcr 1 gene; mcr 5 gene; nonhuman; plasmid; real time polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; animal; bacterium; drug effect; genetics; human; isolation and purification; limit of detection; plasmid; real time polymerase chain reaction; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Colistin; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Limit of Detection; Plasmids; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",,"colistin, 1066-17-7, 1264-72-8; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Colistin",,,"2015KA3XFH; European Commission, EC; Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, DTU","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Research and University (PRIN Project 2015, prot. 2015KA3XFH).","This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Research and University (PRIN Project 2015, prot. 2015KA3XFH).

In the popular media, CBEs are commonly referred to as ""puppy mills"" or ""puppy farms."" Conditions in CBEs vary widely in quality. Dogs in these facilities are routinely housed for their entire reproductive lives in cages or runs, and provided with minimal to no positive human interaction or other forms of environmental enrichment. Numerous anecdotal reports have suggested that after removal from CBEs many of the former breeding dogs display persistent behavioural and psychological abnormalities when compared with the general pet dog population. The purpose of this study was to determine if this anecdotal evidence could be confirmed empirically. Behavioural evaluations of the dogs were obtained from current owners/fosterers using the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), which utilizes ordinal scales to rate either the intensity or frequency of the dog's behaviours. A total of 1169 former CBE dogs were included in the study. Among the CBE ex-breeding dogs, 76 different breeds were represented. With the exception of the Bichon Frise (31.5%), all other breeds comprised <5% of the dogs. The sex ratio was 70.3% females and 29.7% males. The dogs had been living in their adoptive homes for an average of 2 years when the C-BARQ was completed. When compared with a convenience sample of pet dogs matched for breed, sex, age and neuter status, former CBE breeding dogs were reported as showing significantly higher rates of health problems (23.5% versus 16.6%, P= 0.026). With respect to behaviour, CBE dogs displayed significantly higher rates of fear (both social and nonsocial; ordinal GLM models, P< 0.001), house-soiling (P< 0.001), and compulsive staring (P< 0.005); and significantly lower rates of aggression (toward strangers and other dogs; P< 0.0001), trainability (P< 0.0001), chasing small animals (P< 0.0001), excitability (P< 0.0001), and energy (P< 0.0001).By demonstrating that dogs maintained in these environments develop extreme and persistent fears and phobias, possible learning deficits as evidenced by lower trainability, and often show difficulty in coping successfully with normal existence, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that the conditions prevailing in CBEs are injurious to the mental health and welfare of dogs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",C-BARQ; Dog; Psychopathology; Puppy mill; Stress; Welfare,aggression; animal welfare; behavioral ecology; breeding population; canid; commercial species; learning; mental health; pathology; sex ratio; Animalia; Canis familiaris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, H.C., Fox, M.W., Himwich, W.A., Neurochemical and behavioural effects of isolation-rearing in the dog (1967) Life Sci., 6, pp. 71-78; Beerda, B., Schilder, M.B., van Hooff, J.A., de Vries, H.W., Mol, J.A., Chronic stress in dogs subjected to social and spatial restriction.

Recent studies have challenged this dogma providing evidence that both pharmacological treatments and paradigms based on the manipulation of environmental stimulation levels can be successfully employed as strategies for enhancing plasticity in the adult nervous system. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a peptide implicated in prenatal and postnatal phases of brain development such as neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis, and experience-dependent plasticity. Here, using the visual system as a paradigmatic model, we report that IGF-1 reactivates neural plasticity in the adult brain. Exogenous administration of IGF-1 in the adult visual cortex, indeed, restores the susceptibility of cortical neurons to monocular deprivation and promotes the recovery of normal visual functions in adult amblyopic animals. These effects were accompanied by a marked reduction of intracortical GABA levels. Moreover, we show that a transitory increase of IGF-1 expression is associated to the plasticity reinstatement induced by environmental enrichment (EE) and that blocking IGF-1 action by means of the IGF-1 receptor antagonist JB1 prevents EE effects on plasticity processes.

Effects in offspring after preconceptional, prenatal, or perinatal exposure to cannabis smoke or Δ9-THC were considered. Locomotor and exploratory behavior effects were noted in rats. Cognitive effects observed included impairment of memory and learning, attention deficits, time taken to complete tasks (rats) and alterations in response to visual stimuli (rats/monkeys). Emotionality was observed in rodents as an increase in separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations, reduced social interaction and play behavior, and increased generalized anxiety. Increased rate of acquisition of morphine self-administration and/or enhanced sensitivity towards the rewarding effects of morphine or heroin were observed in adult rats prenatally exposed to Δ9-THC. Expression of cannabinoid receptors was examined in rodent studies along with behavioral parameters. Altered mRNA levels of genes relevant to synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (the brain region associated with compulsivity, addiction vulnerability, and reward sensitivity) were noted. Findings in zebrafish supported effects in mammalian models. Neurochemical effects on specific brain regions and neurotransmitter systems seen in these animal studies appear to impact cognitive function, motor activity, and drug sensitivity. Mechanistic studies provided evidence for the biological plausibility of effects observed. Observations from animal studies of changes in motor behavior, cognitive performance, emotionality and susceptibility to drug sensitivity later in life were among the findings from animal and human studies considered by California's Developmental and Reproductive Toxicant Identification Committee, in concluding that cannabis smoke and Δ9-THC are developmental toxicants. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",cross generational; developmental toxicity; epigenetics; neurodevelopment; proposition 65; THC,cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabinoid receptor; cannabis; dopamine 2 receptor; dronabinol; endocannabinoid; morphine; neurotransmitter; noradrenalin; tetrahydrocannabinol; cannabis; dronabinol; morphine derivative; amygdala; anxiety; apoptosis; astrocyte; attention; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; brain development; brain region; cannabis smoking; cannabis use; cell proliferation; cognition; depression; developmental toxicity; drug seeking behavior; drug sensitivity; emotionality; environmental enrichment; estrus cycle; gene expression; hippocampus; learning; learning disorder; locomotion; maternal behavior; memory disorder; motor activity; mRNA expression level; myelination; nervous system development; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; open field test; ovariectomy; protein expression; reproductive toxicity; Review; seizure; sexual behavior; signal transduction; social interaction; synaptogenesis; visual attention; zebra fish; animal; female; human; mammal; pregnancy; rat; smoke; Animals; Cannabis; Dronabinol; Female; Humans; Mammals; Morphine Derivatives; Pregnancy; Rats; Smoke; Zebrafish,,"cannabis, 8001-45-4, 8063-14-7; dronabinol, 7663-50-5; morphine, 52-26-6, 57-27-2; noradrenalin, 1407-84-7, 51-41-2; tetrahydrocannabinol, 1972-08-3; Dronabinol; Morphine Derivatives; Smoke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abel, E.L., Effects of delta 9-THC on pregnancy and offspring in rats (1984) Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology, 6, pp. 29-32; Abel, E.L., Subramanian, M., Zajac, C.S., Maternal age does not affect tetrahydrocannabinols in utero actions in rats (1990) Life Sciences, 46, pp. 903-908; Abel, E.L., Subramanian, M.G., Effects of low doses of alcohol on delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol's effects in pregnant rats (1990) Life Sciences, 47, pp. 1677-1682; Achenbach, J.C., Hill, J., Hui, J.P.M., Morash, M.G., Berrue, F., Ellis, L.D., Analysis of the uptake, metabolism, and behavioral effects of cannabinoids on zebrafish larvae (2018) Zebrafish, 15, pp. 349-360; Ahmed, K.T., Amin, M.R., Shah, P., Ali, D.W., Motor neuron development in zebrafish is altered by brief (5-hr) exposures to THC ([9]-tetrahydrocannabinol) or cbd (cannabidiol) during gastrulation (2018) Scientific Reports, 8, p. 10518; Bara, A., Ferland, J.N., Rompala, G., Szutorisz, H., Hurd, Y.L., Cannabis and synaptic reprogramming of the developing brain (2021) Nature Reviews.

Harvard University, United States, J.S.D. Columbia University, United States","This volume on ecosystem management and law seems a good place for some thoughts on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), ""our basic national charter for protection of the environment.""1 NEPA is famously regarded in court as a 'procedural' statute, a statute that aims not for particular environmental outcomes but rather at the deliberative processes whereby federal agencies make their decisions which then impact the environment. 2 NEPA requires that ""all agencies of the Federal Government . . . include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment a detailed statement by the responsible official,""3 which predicts the environmental impact of the proposed action, any unavoidable adverse environmental impacts should the action be taken, alternatives to the proposed action, and other information useful in deciding whether the reasons for the proposal outweigh or otherwise defeat the reasons against it. Since 1978, when NEPA's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ ) finalized its 'regulations' implementing Section 102(2),5 covered federal agencies have had to divide their NEPA practices into one of several discrete action-types that are oriented around this 'detailed statement' requirement.6 Indeed, these NEPA categories have, in the intervening decades, hardened to become the principal content of NEPA law-the set of obligatory routines into which all covered agency 'actions' must fit and with which they must comply. It is these compli ance-oriented routines that we must better structure if we are to have any hope of shaping NEPA into a selection of tools that we so desperately need to better manage the natural systems we depend upon. For reasons that will become clear, I argue that CEQ seems to be moving NEPA in the right direction, but that it is not doing so quickly or decisively enough. In this chapter, I parse our established NEPA categories, some of the many precedents construing CEQ's rules, some of the hard choices administrators face in NEPA compliance, and the practical differences therein, all in an effort to suggest some modest reforms that could make NEPA more of an aid and less of an obstacle to the ecosystemic management of natural systems. Part I introduces the NEPA action types and the precedents construing their boundaries. Part II sketches the major issues that permeate NEPA practice today, regardless of the action-type which the agency has chosen (or is ordered) to take. Part III proposes a more causation- and less compliance-oriented interpretation of NEPA, an interpretation of NEPA itself as a system with multiple interacting layers and processes that can be managed, but only by the shrewdest and ablest of managers. A serviceable model of NEPA as a system, and one particularly tailored to reworking NEPA as our emerging ecological consciousness would have it, is that of a 'joint cognitive system.' The focus of cognitive systems engineering is the ways in which humans can cope with and master the complexity of their environments. 9 Joint cognitive systems are those that cope with the self-reinforcing complexity of those environments by combining humans and machines into unified, adaptive systems.10 They aim to achieve 'macrocognition' by combining the best of humanity and the machines they invent into the building blocks of extended, complementary, and effective networks of functionality.9 Intentionally engineering such systems is massively complicated and prone to error, because the design challenges involved can lead to compounding the environmental complexity instead of reducing it. The first step is to recognize the elements of this system and their relationships. That is the task of Parts I and II. Copyright © 2013 by The University of Akron Press.

Thereby, the environmental enrichment (EE) is widely used to increase brain plasticity. Here, pregnant female rats were used and their offspring were submitted to neonatal MD from post-natal day 1–10; after weaning the rats were submitted to EE. MD caused deficits on short and long-term aversive and recognition memory and on cognitive flexibility tested on reversed Morris Water Maze test. MD also promoted the decrease of hippocampal Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) protein expression. The EE was able to protect against the cognitive deficits, avoiding the memory and the cognitive flexibility disrupting, and normalizing hippocampal BDNF expression of rats submitted to MD. These data confirms that MD promotes long-life memory deficits and demonstrates that MD causes cognitive flexibility disruption; the mechanisms seem involve the decrease of BDNF.

Canyon Dr., Portland, Oregon, United States","Although there have been few demonstrations of a direct empirical relationship between environmental enrichment and reproductive success in captive animals, indirect and anecdotal evidence indicates the importance of physical and temporal complexity for reproduction. We discuss three major mechanisms through which environmental enrichment that specifically increases the complexity of an animal's surroundings may influence reproductive physiology and behavior: developmental processes, modulation of stress and arousal, and modification of social interactions. In complex environments developing animals learn that performing active behavior produces appropriate functional outcomes. Learning to control their environment influences their ability to adapt to novel situations, which may profoundly influence their reproductive behavior as adults in breeding situations. Chronic stress may compromise reproductive physiology and behavior; enrichment reduces stress by providing increased opportunity for behavioral coping responses. However, some degree of acute stress may be beneficial for reproduction by maintaining an animal's level of responsiveness to socio‐sexual stimuli necessary for sexual arousal and reproductive activation. Finally, environmental enrichment may influence reproductive success by stabilizing social groups, reducing aggression and increasing affiliative and play behaviors. It is concluded that multi‐variate multi‐institutional behavioral research in zoos will play an increasingly important role in the successful captive propagation of many species by closely examining relationships between environmental variables and reproductive potential of individual animals. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

However, species-level resolution is only achieved after a process of 'binning' where contigs predicted to originate from the same genome are clustered. Such culture-independent sequencing frequently unearths novel microbes, and so various methods have been devised for reference-free binning. As novel microbiomes of increasing complexity are explored, sometimes associated with non-model hosts, robust automated binning methods are required. Existing methods struggle with eukaryotic contamination and cannot handle highly complex single metagenomes. We therefore developed an automated binning pipeline, termed 'Autometa', to address these issues. This command-line application integrates sequence homology, nucleotide composition, coverage and the presence of single-copy marker genes to separate microbial genomes from non-model host genomes and other eukaryotic contaminants, before deconvoluting individual genomes from single metagenomes. The method is able to effectively separate over 1000 genomes from a metagenome, allowing the study of previously intractably complex environments at the level of single species.

Institut für Zoologie und Anthropologie, Universität Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany","In standard cage (SC) raised mice, experience-dependent ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) rapidly declines with age: in postnatal day 25–35 (critical period) mice, 4 days of monocular deprivation (MD) are sufficient to induce OD-shifts towards the open eye; thereafter, 7 days of MD are needed. Beyond postnatal day 110, even 14 days of MD failed to induce OD-plasticity in mouse V1. In contrast, mice raised in a so-called “enriched environment” (EE), exhibit lifelong OD-plasticity. EE-mice have more voluntary physical exercise (running wheels), and experience more social interactions (bigger housing groups) and more cognitive stimulation (regularly changed labyrinths or toys). Whether experience-dependent shifts of V1-activation happen faster in EE-mice and how long the plasticity promoting effect would persist after transferring EE-mice back to SCs has not yet been investigated. To this end, we used intrinsic signal optical imaging to visualize V1-activation i) before and after MD in EE-mice of different age groups (from 1–9 months), and ii) after transferring mice back to SCs after postnatal day 130. Already after 2 days of MD, and thus much faster than in SC-mice, EE-mice of all tested age groups displayed a significant OD-shift towards the open eye. Transfer of EE-mice to SCs immediately abolished OD-plasticity: already after 1 week of SC-housing and MD, OD-shifts could no longer be visualized. In an attempt to rescue abolished OD-plasticity of these mice, we either administered the anti-depressant fluoxetine (in drinking water) or supplied a running wheel in the SCs. OD-plasticity was only rescued for the running wheel- mice. Altogether our results show that raising mice in less deprived environments like large EE-cages strongly accelerates experience-dependent changes in V1-activation compared to the impoverished SC-raising. Furthermore, preventing voluntary physical exercise of EE-mice in adulthood immediately precludes OD-shifts in V1. © 2017 Kalogeraki et al.

Another objective was to answer the question whether the behavioural differences between adult birds would be evident already in the chick period or whether they are an effect of the further modifying impact of the environment. 60 green-legged partridge, 60 Polbar, and 60 Leghorn chicks were used in the experiments. The chicks hatched in a flock where hens were previously assessed with behavioural tests and the corticosterone levels in their feathers was determined, indicating significant differences in the temperament and stress level between the breeds. Five tests were carried out: two on competitiveness, activity, interest and fearfulness/curiosity. The experiments revealed considerable differences between the chicks. The Zk birds coped better with situations requiring swiftness and initiative. The Pb chicks were slower than Zk and Lg and did not make quick decisions. Hence, a lower number of these birds entering and leaving the test cage and staying inside was recorded. The Zk chicks exhibited a higher level of fearfulness than the other breeds. In terms of the environment enrichment elements, sand and woodchips were more attractive to the Zk chicks, whereas the Lg and Pb birds preferred pecking the string. No differences in the time of undertaking the analysed activities were found between the breeds. © 2020 by the authors.

Hebb that rats raised as pets in his home performed markedly better on problem-solving tasks than those kept in the laboratory. In the subsequent years, numerous studies ensued demonstrating that EE was also capable of inducing neuroplasticity in normal (i.e., noninjured) rats. These behavioral and neural alterations provided the impetus for investigating EE as a potential therapy for traumatic brain injury (TBI), which, over the past two decades, has resulted in several reports. Hence, the aim of this review is to integrate the findings and present the current state of EE as a viable neurorehabilitation strategy for TBI. Using the specific key term searches ""traumatic brain injury"" and ""environmental enrichment"" or ""enriched environment,"" 30 and 30 experimental TBI articles were identified by PubMed and Scopus, respectively. Of these, 27 articles were common to both search engines. An additional article was found on PubMed using the key terms ""enriched environment"" and ""fluid percussion."" A review of the bibliographies in the 34 articles did not yield additional citations. The overwhelming consensus of the 34 publications is that EE benefits behavioral and histological outcome after brain injury produced by various models. Further, the enhancements are observed in male and female as well as adult and pediatric rats and mice. Taken together, these cumulative findings provide strong support for EE as a generalized and robust preclinical model of neurorehabilitation. However, to further enhance the model and to more accurately mimic the clinic, future studies should continue to evaluate EE during more rehabilitation- relevant conditions, such as delayed and shorter time periods, as well as in combination with other therapeutic approaches, as we have been doing for the past few years. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.","behavior; brain injury; cognition, environmental enrichment; functional recovery; rehabilitation; water maze","2 dipropylamino 8 hydroxytetralin; adenylate kinase; brain derived neurotrophic factor; buspirone; messenger RNA; neurotrophin; tropomyosin; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; behavior; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; environmental enrichment; histopathology; memory consolidation; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; review; spatial learning; stem cell transplantation; traumatic brain injury; animal; Brain Injuries; disease model; environment; mouse; rat; Animals; Brain Injuries; Disease Models, Animal; Environment; Mice; Rats",,"2 dipropylamino 8 hydroxytetralin, 78950-78-4; adenylate kinase, 9013-02-9; brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; buspirone, 33386-08-2, 36505-84-7; tropomyosin, 72067-79-9; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase, 9036-22-0",,,"HD069620, NS060005; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R01NS060005; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: R01HD069620",,,,,,,,,,,"Kline, A.E., Wagner, A.K., Westergom, B.P., Malena, R.R., Zafonte, R.D., Olsen, A.S., Sozda, C.N., Aslam, H.A., Acute treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and chronic environmental enrichment confer neurobehavioral benefit after experimental brain trauma (2007) Behav.

Different social ecologies often require different learning strategies and also modulate response to stressors and gonadal development. To measure effects of the social environment on the interaction between cognition and emotion during aging, we focused on a natural learning context and devised the sectored foraging field, a progressively difficult spatial navigation task. Here, we describe how this apparatus and protocol permits multiple learning strategies in a minimally stressful environment, enabling finely graded analyses of cognition and emotionality. Male Sprague-Dawley rats living alone throughout adulthood adopted a sex-typic discernible spatial strategy. In contrast, males housed in group contexts utilized an algorithmic kinesthetic strategy, repeating the same motor action until they found food. Removal of food and distal, but not local cues, elicited anxious alertness, particularly in group-housed males. Cognitive performance of group-housed rats subsequent to food and cue removal was significantly impaired, yet enhanced in isolates. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats underwent three 45-min sessions per day of prenatal restraint stress (PS) on gestation days 11-21, and their offspring were assigned to either an enriched-environment or standard living cages throughout adolescence [postnatal days (pnd) 22-43]. Juvenile rats from stressed pregnancies had a prominent depression of affiliative/playful behaviour and of basal circulating CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes and T4/T8 ratio. They also showed increased emotionality and spleen and brain frontal cortex levels of pro-inflammatory interleoukin-1β (IL-1β) cytokine. A more marked response to cyclophosphamide (CPA: two 2 mg/kg IP injections) induced immunosuppression was also found in prenatal stressed rats. Enriched housing increased the amount of time adolescent PS rats spent in positive species-typical behaviours (i.e. play behaviour), reduced emotionality and reverted most of immunological alterations. In addition to its effects in PS rats, enriched housing increased anti-inflammatory IL-2 and reduced pro-inflammatory IL-1β production by activated splenocytes, also producing a marked alleviation of CPA-induced immune depression. In the brain, enriched housing increased IL-1β values in hypothalamus, while slightly normalizing these values in the frontal cortex from PS rats. This is a first indication that an environmental intervention, such as enriched housing, during adolescence can beneficially affect basal immune parameters and rats response to both early stress and drug-induced immunosuppression.",Adolescence; Cyclophosphamide; Environmental enrichment; Immunosuppression; Prenatal stress; Social behaviour,"corticosterone; cyclophosphamide; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; sodium chloride; adolescent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal housing; animal model; animal tissue; article; behavior disorder; child behavior; controlled study; corticosterone blood level; cytokine production; emotionality; environmental enrichment; female; frontal cortex; immobilization stress; immunomodulation; immunopathology; lymphocyte count; male; nonhuman; open field behavior; play; prenatal exposure; priority journal; rat; social behavior; spleen; stress; T lymphocyte subpopulation; tissue level; weight gain; Age Factors; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Brain Chemistry; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Corticosterone; Cyclophosphamide; Cytokines; Environment, Controlled; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Immunosuppressive Agents; Interpersonal Relations; Leukocyte Count; Male; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Restraint, Physical; Stress",,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5; Corticosterone, 50-22-6; Cyclophosphamide, 50-18-0; Cytokines; Immunosuppressive Agents",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ader, R., Friedman, S.B., Grota, L.J., Emotionality' and adrenal cortical function: Effects of strain, test, and the 24-hour corticosterone rhythm (1967) Anim.

Previous studies have shown that repeated toluene exposure produces cellular death and memory impairment, while environmental enrichment (EE) rescues from those effects. However, the mechanisms involved in those responses are unclear. Previous studies have shown that toluene induces a redox imbalance at the neuronal level; although, details on the mechanism of action of environmental enrichment enhancing antioxidant capacity remain to be explored. It is also unexplored whether this putative antioxidant capacity is similar to that produced by pharmacological antioxidants. To study this hypothesis, Swiss-Webster male mice were chronically exposed to toluene (0 or 4000 ppm, 30 min/day/4 weeks). Subsequently, neurochemical tests were conducted to measure biomarkers of oxidative stress (ROS, NO, GSH/GSSG ratio and SOD activity) in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In the second part of the study, we evaluated the putative antioxidant capacity of environmental enrichment and compared it to that of melatonin, a known free radical scavenger and inductor of antioxidant defences. The results showed that chronic toluene exposure increased the levels of pro-oxidative molecules and decreased the antioxidant markers. Conversely, environmental enrichment restored oxidative balance in animals previously exposed to toluene. Furthermore, the effects of EE were similar to those obtained with melatonin. Altogether, alterations in oxidative balance could represent an intermediate signalling pathway in the cascade of effects induced by toluene, while EE and melatonin appear to have the ability to rescue those effects. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental enrichment; Melatonin; Oxidative stress; Toluene,"biological marker; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; glutathione; glutathione disulfide; manganese superoxide dismutase; melatonin; nitric oxide; nitrite; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; toluene; antioxidant; melatonin; toluene; animal experiment; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; comparative study; controlled study; environmental enrichment; environmental exposure; enzyme activity; hippocampus; long term exposure; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; signal transduction; animal; animal behavior; cell death; drug effect; environment; lipid peroxidation; memory disorder; metabolism; nerve cell; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; Animals; Antioxidants; Behavior, Animal; Cell Death; Environment; Hippocampus; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Melatonin; Memory Disorders; Mice; Neurons; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Prefrontal Cortex; Toluene",,"copper zinc superoxide dismutase, 149394-67-2; glutathione, 70-18-8; glutathione disulfide, 27025-41-8; melatonin, 73-31-4; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nitrite, 14797-65-0; superoxide dismutase, 37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1; toluene, 108-88-3; Antioxidants; Melatonin; Toluene",,,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT: 666346","This paper includes data from the Master’s dissertation by Yepci Guadalupe Yee Ríos, CONACYT, Mexico, fellowship number 666346.

The cognitive impairment induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) is currently poorly treated. Growing evidence indicates that an enriched environment (EE) improves cognition function in models of Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and lipopolysaccharide. However, the effects of EE on hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as synaptic plasticity markers changes induced by MSD, are unclear. In the present study, pregnant CD-1 mice were randomly divided into a control group, MSD group, and MSD+EE group. Two different living environments, including standard environment and EE, were prepared. When male and female offspring were 2 months, the open field test and elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behavior, and the Morris water maze was used to evaluate hippocampal learning and memory. Western blotting and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in the hippocampus of offspring. The results revealed that MSD-induced offspring showed anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, while EE alleviated anxiety-like behavior and cognitive impairment in offspring of the MSD+EE group. The cognitive impairment induced by MSD was associated with a decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an increased Synaptotagmin-1, while EE increased and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in the hippocampus of mice from the MSD+EE group, respectively. Taken together, we can conclude that EE has beneficial effects on MSD-induced synaptic plasticity markers changes and can alleviate anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment.

The enriched environment (EE) can improve depression-like behaviors and reduce inflammatory reactions, but it is unclear whether this is by changing the inflammatory activation phenotype of microglia. Method: A depression rat model was established using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for four weeks. The rats were then treated with EE or fluoxetine administration during the following three weeks. Behavior tests including sucrose preference, forced swimming and open field were applied to evaluate the depression-like behaviors of rats at the baseline period prior to CUS, the end of fourth week and at the end of the seventh week. Microglial activation and hippocampal neuro-inflammation were detected on postmortem using immunofluorescence, western blotting, and real-time polymerase reaction (PCR). Result: The results showed that severe depressive-like behavior was induced by four weeks of CUS. Changes in peripheral blood inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA. Immunofluorescent staining showed the IBA-1 of microglia activation marker level significantly increased in affected rats. The hippocampal microglial activation state was determined by measuring the increased levels of iNOS an M1 marker and the decreased levels of CD206, an M2 marker. The activation of NF-κB upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and factors such as IL-10 were decreased. This study showed that EE and chronic fluoxetine treatment alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by chronic stress and significantly inhibited microglial activation, activated NF-κB inflammasome and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: EE can alleviate depression-like behavior by modulating the phenotype of microglia, inhibiting pro-inflammatory genes, and promoting anti-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, EE can effectively reduce the phosphorylation and expression levels of NF-κB. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Depression; Enriched environment; Hippocampus; Inflammatory; Microglia,"fluoxetine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; messenger RNA; nitric oxide synthase; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell activation; chronic unpredictable stress; comparative study; controlled study; depression; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence; forced swim test; hippocampal tissue; hippocampus; immobility time; immunofluorescence; immunofluorescence assay; inflammation; male; microglia; mRNA expression level; nervous system inflammation; nonhuman; open field test; optical density; phenotype; protein expression level; protein phosphorylation; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; sucrose preference test; sugar intake; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; disease model; hippocampus; mental stress; metabolism; Animals; Depression; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus; Microglia; Phenotype; Rats; Stress, Psychological",,"fluoxetine, 54910-89-3, 56296-78-7, 59333-67-4, 57226-07-0; nitric oxide synthase, 125978-95-2",,"ilai shuzhou pharmaceuticals, China","ZDSYS2018010, ZDSYS2019009; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 81671346; Henan Key Laboratory of Biological Psychiatry","This work was supported by Henan Key Laboratory of Biological Psychiatry .

The current study investigated the recovery of P and enrichment of REEs from Florida waste clay (WC). Clays, dolomite, and quartz are the main associated gangue minerals, while apatite is the predominant P-bearing mineral, and monazite and xenotime are the rare earth minerals in this WC. A 1.5-in. diam. hydro-cyclone unit was initially employed for the removal of clays. Froth flotation was then examined for the separation of values from the cyclone underflow. Various depressants and surface modifying agents were assessed for both direct and reverse flotation separations. Results showed that the direct flotation does not offer a solution for the selective recovery of P from WC. Despite their documented affinity for apatite and rare earths, hydroxamic acid collectors do not produce a selective separation. A single-stage reverse cationic process provides a more economically viable route due to its capability to avoid the loss of REEs. Test results of the single-stage reverse cationic process indicated that the P2O5 grade was increased to 21 wt.% from an initial grade of ∼8 wt.% with a corresponding recovery of approximately 80%. The REE content was elevated from an initial value of 307.1 ppm to 800 ppm, with an 80% recovery resulting from the same process. The removal of clays, silicates, and carbonates up to a point to meet the medium-grade phosphate ore specifications also facilitates the subsequent recovery of REEs using chemical separation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Clay; De-sliming; Flotation; Phosphorus; REE; Waste,Apatite; Flotation; Rare earths; Recovery; Silicates; Storms; 'current; Cationics; De-sliming; Florida; Rare-earths; REE; Secondary resources; Single stage; Supply-demand; Valorisation; Phosphorus; aluminum; apatite; carbonic acid derivative; dolomite; lanthanide; magnesium; mineral; monazite; phosphate; phosphorus; silicate; silicon; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; xenotime; carbonate; cation; clay; enrichment; phosphorus; rare earth element; silicate; waste treatment; adsorption density; Article; chemical composition; controlled study; de sliming; density; environmental enrichment; Florida; froth flotation; isoelectric point; particle size; pH; separation technique; waste; waste clay; waste component removal; zeta potential; Florida,,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; apatite, 64476-38-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; silicate, 12627-13-3; silicon, 7440-21-3; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9, 14464-46-1","S-4700, Hitachi; Vanta, Olympus",Hitachi; Olympus,,"We are thankful to WVU Shared Research Facilities (SRF) managers, Dr. Marcela Redigolo for her assistance in performing SEM/ EDS analyses, and Dr. Qiang Wang for his assistance in performing the XRD analyses.",,,,,,,,,,"Karunanithi, R., Szogi, A.A., Bolan, N., Naidu, R., Loganathan, P., Hunt, P.G., Vanotti, M.B., Krishnamoorthy, S., Phosphorus recovery and reuse from waste streams (2015) Advances in Agronomy, 131, pp. 173-250. , Academic Press; Haldar, S.K., Mineral exploration: Principles and Applications (2018), Elsevier; Matinde, E., Simate, G.S., Ndlovu, S., Mining and metallurgical wastes: a review of recycling and re-use practices (2018) J.

Whether this selection impacted animal robustness is still unclear. In this study, we compared Large White (LW) pigs, a breed submitted to intense genetic selection for production traits, and Basque (B) pigs, a local rustic breed, reared in two different housing environments (conventional v. enriched). Adaptation to housing conditions among each breed was evaluated at the level of endocrine and immune traits. These are known to be impacted by housing conditions and breed; however, the interaction effects between genotype and environment are less described. Animals (20 per breed and housing environment) entered the experiment at 35 kg of live weight. Levels of cortisol, acute-phase inflammatory proteins, immunoglobulins and hydrogen peroxide, blood formula, lymphocyte proliferation and in-vitro cytokine expression were measured at â̂115 kg of live weight. Animals were checked for skin injuries during the growing period. At slaughter, at the average live weight of 145 kg, carcasses were examined for pathological conditions of the respiratory tract. The major result was that the two breeds exhibited differences in response to the housing environment. Among the 24 sanitary, endocrine or immune traits investigated, the housing conditions affected eight variables in both breeds (salivary cortisol at 0700 and 1900 h, severity of pneumonia at slaughter) or only in B pigs (severe skin lesions) or LW pigs (salivary cortisol at 1500 h, granulocyte numbers and lymphocyte/granulocyte ratio and lymphocyte proliferation). These observations strengthen the hypothesis that selection for high meat production level might be associated with an increased susceptibility of animals to environmental stressors. © Copyright The Animal Consortium 2012.",breed; cortisol; housing; leukocytes; pig,"acute phase protein; hydrocortisone; hydrogen peroxide; immunoglobulin; analysis of variance; animal; animal housing; article; blood; cell proliferation; comparative study; France; genetic selection; genotype; granulocyte; health status; immunology; lymphocyte count; male; orchiectomy; physiology; species difference; standard; swine; Acute-Phase Proteins; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cell Proliferation; France; Genotype; Granulocytes; Health Status; Housing, Animal; Hydrocortisone; Hydrogen Peroxide; Immunoglobulins; Lymphocyte Count; Male; Orchiectomy; Selection, Genetic; Species Specificity; Sus scrofa; Animalia; Pieris brassicae; Suidae",,"hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; Acute-Phase Proteins; Hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; Hydrogen Peroxide, 7722-84-1; Immunoglobulins",,,FOOD-CT-2007-036245,"The authors gratefully acknowledge from the European Community financial participation under the 6th Framework Program for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities, for the Integrated Project Q-PORKCHAINS FOOD-CT-2007-036245.

Partners first were given the opportunity for noncontact familiarization in partitioned double cages. They were then transferred into an ordinary double cage. Clear‐cut rank relationships were evident within the first 90 minutes of pair formation in 94% (17/18) of dyads tested. Only 28% (5/18) of pairs resorted to fighting (in no case with infliction of serious injury), while 50% (9/18) engaged in social grooming or hugging during this initial phase of pair formation. Eighty‐three percent (15/18) of pairs were compatible, with none of the partners showing signs of depression and none inflicting serious injury on the other. Seventeen percent (3/18) of pairs were incompatible (two cases of depression, one serious tail injury) and were separated. It was concluded that the barren environment of singly caged rhesus monkey females can be enriched with little risk by carefully making them compatible companions.

This resistance to enrichment is often explained via mechanisms that decouple abnormal behaviour from current welfare, such as 'establishment': a hypothetical process whereby repetition increases behaviour's predictability and resistance to change. If such hypotheses are correct, then animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should still find enrichments rewarding. Alternatively, this behaviour could reflect a failure to improve welfare: plausible because age and chronic stress increase neophobia and anhedonia. If this hypothesis is correct, animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should value enrichments less than conspecifics. We tested these hypotheses using C57BL/6 mice, Mus musculus, aged 10-11 and 6-7 months, raised in barren laboratory cages. We observed their behaviour in both these and large enriched cages. Enrichment was more effective on the younger animals. However, contrary to ideas about establishment, the spontaneous predictability of stereotypic behaviour did not increase with age; nor was enrichment less effective on more predictable or time-consuming forms. We assessed the reward value of enriched cages by allowing access via progressively weighted doors (maximum weight pushed corresponding to peak motivation). In older mice, those individuals whose stereotypic behaviour was least reduced by enrichment were also the least motivated to gain access to enrichment. This suggests that the welfare of middle-aged-animals, as well as their stereotypic behaviour, is harder to improve using environmental enrichment. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Age; Animal welfare; Enrichment; Establishment; Laboratory mice; Motivation; Mus musculus; Reward value; Stereotypic behaviour,age structure; animal welfare; captive population; enrichment; hypothesis testing; laboratory method; rodent; stereotypic behavior; Animalia; Mus; Mus musculus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ames, A., (1994) The Welfare and Management of Bears in Zoological Gardens, , Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, Potters Bar; Augustsson, H., Van de Weerd, H.A., Kruitwagen, C.L.J.J., Baumans, V., Effect of enrichment on variation and results in the light/dark test (2003) Laboratory Animals, 37, pp. 328-340; Baker, K.C., Advanced age influences chimpanzee behavior in small social groups (2000) Zoo Biology, 19, pp. 111-119; Benus, R.F., den Daas, S., Koolhaas, J.M., van Oortmerssen, G.A., Routine-formation and flexibility in social and nonsocial behaviour of aggressive and non-aggressive male mice (1990) Behaviour, 112, pp. 176-193; Bondi, C.O., Rodriguez, G., Gould, G.G., Frazer, A., Morilak, D.A., Chronic unpredictable stress induces a cognitive deficit and anxiety-like behavior in rats that is prevented by chronic antidepressant drug treatment (2008) Neuropsychopharmacology, 33, pp. 320-331; Burghardt, G., (2005) The Genesis of Animal Play: Testing the Limits, , MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Clubb, R., (2001), Factors affecting the development of abnormal, stereotyped behaviour in zoo-housed carnivores.

Khorramabad River which flows through Khorramabad city, west of Iran, is an example of such settings. The river water is used for agricultural purposes downstream. In this study, the effect of Khorramabad city on heavy metal and metalloid (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, and As) loads in Khorramabad River sediments was investigated. To evaluate sediment pollution and potential adverse biological effects, surface sediment samples were collected at selected locations along the river and were characterized for their geochemical properties. Contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), and ecological risk assessment (RI) were calculated. Also, sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) were used to screen contaminants of concern in the study area. The results showed that sediments were moderately polluted, with stations located in more densely populated areas showing higher pollution indicators. Copper, Zn, and Pb sources could be attributed to urban wastewater, whereas Ni, Cr, and As had both natural and anthropogenic sources. Moreover, ecological risk assessments showed that sediments could be classified in the category of low risk. The results of the present study showed the effect of anthropogenic activities on heavy metal loads of the river sediments and these findings can be used to mitigate potential impacts on the environment and human health. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Heavy metal;

To determine the response mechanisms of T. japonicus against long-term exposure to OA and Hg pollution, we investigated the proteome of F3 copepods after multigenerational exposure to four conditions: pCO2 400 μatm + control; pCO2 1000 μatm + control; pCO2 400 μatm +1.0 μg/L Hg; and pCO2 1000 μatm +1.0 μg/L Hg. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that OA enhanced the copepod's energy production mainly by increasing protein assimilation and proteolysis as a compensatory strategy, which explained its physiological resilience to reduced pH. Conversely, Hg treatment decreased many critical processes, including ferric iron binding, antioxidant activity, cellular homeostasis, and glutathione metabolism, and these toxic events could translate into higher-level responses, i.e., restrained reproduction in copepods. Importantly, the mediation of Hg toxicity in T. japonicus by OA could be explained by the enhanced lysosome-autophagy pathway proteomes that are responsible for repairing and removing damaged proteins and enzymes under stress. Overall, this study provided molecular insights into the response of T. japonicus to long-term exposure of OA and Hg, with a particular emphasis on the mitigating impact of the CO2-driven acidification on Hg toxicity. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Acidification; Mercury (metal); Physiology; Proteins; Toxicity; Anti-oxidant activities; Cellular homeostasis; Compensatory strategy; Functional enrichment analysis; Glutathione metabolism; Multigenerational exposures; Ocean acidifications; Response mechanisms; Pollution control; carbon dioxide; ferric ion; glutathione; mercury; proteome; mercury; proteome; sea water; chemical binding; crustacean; dose-response relationship; homeostasis; mercury (element); metabolism; mitigation; ocean acidification; physiological response; pollution exposure; protein; toxicity; acidification; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; antioxidant activity; Article; autophagy; cell stress; controlled study; copepod; energy yield; environmental enrichment; environmental exposure; homeostasis; iron binding capacity; long term exposure; lysosome; nonhuman; pH; protein degradation; proteomics; reproductive toxicity; sea; animal; copepod; genetics; sea; toxicity; water pollutant; Copepoda; Tigriopus japonicus; Animals; Copepoda; Mercury; Oceans and Seas; Proteome; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; ferric ion, 20074-52-6; glutathione, 70-18-8; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; Mercury; Proteome; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 41476094; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province: 2017J01081; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2016YFA0601203","This work was kindly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41476094), the National Key Research and Development Program (no. 2016YFA0601203), and the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China (no. 2017J01081).

Here, we report an experimental study investigating if behaviors shaped by stimuli from environmental enrichment depending on the stage animals are exposed to enrichment. We used juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in their first autumn. This is a species commonly reared for conservation purposes. Previous work has shown that environmental enrichment had no effect on long-term survival when the fry stage (smaller than 70 mm) was released, but that if late parr stages (larger than 70 mm) are released, enrichment is reported to have a positive effect on smolt migration survival. Here, we explored the effect of enrichment at two different stages of development. Both stages were reared and treated for 7 weeks (fry at 11–18 weeks and parr at 24–31 weeks after hatching) before tested for behavior. Responses known to be associated with exploratory behavior, activity, and stress coping were quantified by testing 18-week-old fry and 31-week-old parr in a six-chamber maze on 7 successive days after rearing in structurally enriched (plastic plants and tubes) or plain impoverished rearing environments. The data show that Atlantic salmon are sensitive to stimuli from structural enrichment when they are parr, but not when in the fry stage. Parr deprived of enrichment (control treatment) were reluctant to start exploring the maze, and when they did, they spent a longer time frozen than enriched parr, suggesting that deprivation of enrichment at this life can be stressful. Our data suggest that structural enrichment could have the potential to improve welfare for salmonids in captivity and for survival of released juvenile salmon if structural enrichment is provided at the parr stage and the fish reared for conservation are released at the parr stage. © Copyright © 2021 Alnes, Jensen, Skorping and Salvanes.",experience; exploratory behavior; natal habitat enrichment; sensitive life stage; stress coping behavior,animal behavior; article; autumn; controlled study; coping behavior; environmental enrichment; experimental study; exploratory behavior; habitat; hatching; long term survival; nonhuman; physiological stress; quantitative analysis; rearing; Salmo salar; smolt,,,,,"Universitetet i Bergen, UiB",The Nansen Foundation and the University of Bergen funded this work.,"We thank the Nansen Foundation and the University of Bergen for funding and the Voss hatchery for fish.

Mounting interest in this topic from biological scientists, psychologists, and medical specialists has resulted in new findings that are discussed in this review. Recent Findings: Known psychological influences on wound healing include stress as well as coping styles, positive affect, environmental enrichment, and social support. Research has highlighted the roles of oxytocin, vasopressin, epinephrine, cortisol, and leukocyte redistribution in wound healing. Clinical significance has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies in patient populations. Furthermore, pragmatic interventions with clinical samples have demonstrated clear benefits of psychological interventions on wound healing. Summary: Recent studies add to growing evidence that psychology impacts wound repair, and highlight in particular the positive role of social support on modulating the negative effects of stress. The first few studies to demonstrate that psychological interventions can improve healing in clinical populations are exciting developments. New knowledge of psychobiological mechanisms provides opportunities to develop further interventions to improve health outcomes. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",intervention; mechanisms; psychology; social support; stress; wound healing,"adrenalin; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; gelatinase A; hydrocortisone; hydroxyproline; nitric oxide; oxytocin; vasopressin; affect; cellular distribution; coping behavior; diabetic foot; distress syndrome; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; keratinocyte; leukocyte; nonhuman; psychology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; signal transduction; social interaction; social stress; social support; stress; tensile strength; wound healing; Animals; Forecasting; Humans; Mice; Psychoneuroimmunology; Stress, Psychological; Wound Healing",,"adrenalin, 51-43-4, 55-31-2, 6912-68-1; gelatinase A, 146480-35-5; hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; hydroxyproline, 51-35-4, 6912-67-0; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; oxytocin, 50-56-6, 54577-94-5; vasopressin, 11000-17-2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Walburn, J., Vedhara, K., Hankins, M., Psychological stress and wound healing in humans: A systematic review and meta-analysis (2009) J Psychosom Res, 67, pp. 253-271; Alexander, S., Malignant fungating wounds: Managing pain, bleeding and psychosocial issues (2009) J Wound Care, 18, pp. 418-425; Brown, A., Managing chronic venous leg ulcers: Time for a new approach?

It is important to emphasize that consistent different personality-like traits emerge and accumulate over time in laboratory mice despite genetic and environmental standardization. To understand to what extent variability can unfold over time, we conducted a long-term study using inbred mice living in an exceptionally complex environment comprising an area of 4.6 m2 spread over five levels. In this semi-naturalistic environment (SNE) the activity and spatial distribution of 20 female C57Bl/6J was recorded by radio-frequency identification (RFID). All individuals were monitored from an age of 11 months to 22 months and their individual pattern of spatial movement in time is described as roaming entropy. Overall, we detected an increase of diversification in roaming behavior over time with stabilizing activity patterns at the individual level. However, spontaneous behavior of the animals as well as physiological parameters did not correlate with cumulative roaming entropy. Moreover, the amount of variability did not exceed the literature data derived from mice living in restricted conventional laboratory conditions. We conclude that even taking quantum leaps towards improving animal welfare does not inevitably mean a setback in terms of data quality. © 2021 by the authors.

The protective role of an enriched condition (EC) against psychogenic stressors in various animal models has been well documented. However, this condition has not been tested in field mice in the context of PTSD. In this study, we show that field mice (Mus booduga) housed under EC exhibit predominantly proactive and less reactive behavior compared with mice housed under standard conditions (SC) during exposure to their natural predator (field rat Rattus rattus). Furthermore, we observed that EC mice displayed less anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark-box after exposure to the predator (7 hrs/7 days). In EC mice, predator exposure elevated the level of serotonin (5-Hydroxytrypamine, [5-HT]) in the amygdala as part of the coping response. Subsequently, the serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5-HT1A receptor were up-regulated significantly, but the same did not occur in the 5-HT2C receptor, which is associated with the activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKII) and a transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Our results show that predator exposure induced the activation of CaMKII/CREB, which is accompanied with increased levels of histone acetylation (H3, H4) and decreased histone deacetylases (HDAC1, 2). Subsequently, in the amygdala, the transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 receptor were up-regulated, whereas the Y2 receptor was down-regulated. Therefore, EC facilitated a coping response against a fear associated cue in a PTSD animal model and reduced anxiety by differentially activating serotonergic and NPY-ergic systems. © 2015 Ragu Varman, Rajan.

On the other hand, enriched environment (EE) has beneficial effects on hippocampal structure and function, such as improved memory, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, and progressive synaptic plasticity. It is unclear whether exposure to short-term EE for 10 days can overcome restraint stress–induced cognitive deficits and impaired hippocampal plasticity. Consequently, the present study explored the beneficial effects of short-term EE on chronic stress–induced impaired LTP, working memory, and anxiety-like behavior. Male Wistar rats were subjected to chronic restraint stress (6 hr/day) over a period of 21 days, and then they were exposed to EE (6 hr/day) for 10 days. Restraint stress reduced hippocampal CA1-LTP, increased anxiety-like symptoms in elevated plus maze, and impaired working memory in T-maze task. Remarkably, EE facilitated hippocampal LTP, improved working memory performance, and completely overcame the effect of chronic stress on anxiety behavior. In conclusion, exposure to EE can bring out positive effects on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and thereby elicit its beneficial effects on cognitive functions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",chronic stress;

In this chapter we describe different laboratory- and field-based investigation aiming to identify defence mechanisms behind intra-specific tolerance in E. siliculosus toward copper (Cu) pollution. The E. siliculosus strain Es524, isolated from a Cu-polluted location in northern Chile, showed the highest defences compared to other four strains when exposed to up to 2.4 μM copper for 10 d. The response manifested in less intracellular copper, higher induction and polymerization of metal-chelating phytochelatins, increased syntheses of antioxidants glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC), and higher expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD); all the latter were responsible, at least in part, for the low signs of oxidative damage and physiological impairment observed in this strain. Laboratory experiments help identifying specific metabolic responses, but do not represent what happens in the natural, more complex, environment. Thus, we designed a novel transplantation technique for field experiments with E. siliculosus. The algae was enclosed in a dialysis tubing device and deployed in Cu-polluted and pristine locations. Antioxidant responses of Es524 in the field were similar to those recorded in laboratory experiments, supporting that the recorded defences were mediated by copper excess. Moreover, the method was successful for environmental diagnosis and can be applied globally in temperate coastal ecosystems. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

There is growing confidence in the international community to abandon the conventional practices of “cage-rearing and beak-trimming” to improve the welfare of chickens. Therefore, in this review, we summarized some of the effective poultry management practices that have provided welfare benefits for pullets. The results are as follows: 1. Maintaining similar housing conditions at different periods alleviates fear and discomfort among pullets; 2. Pullets reared under cage-free systems have better physical conditions and temperaments than those reared in cage systems, and they are more suitable to be transferred to similar housing to lay eggs; 3. Improving flock uniformity in appearance and body size has reduced the risk of pecking and injury; 4. Maintaining an appropriate population (40–500 birds) has reduced flock aggressiveness; 5. A combination of 8–10 h of darkness and 5–30 lux of light-intensity exposure via natural or warm white LED light has achieved a welfare–performance balance in pullets. (This varies by age, strain, and activities.); 6. Dark brooders (mimicking mother hens) have alleviated fear and pecking behaviors in pullets; 7. The air quality of the chicken house has been effectively improved by optimizing feed formulation and ventilation, and by reducing fecal accumulation and fermentation; 8. Complex environments (with litter, perches, straw bales, slopes, platforms, outdoor access, etc.) have stimulated the activities of chickens and have produced good welfare effects. In conclusion, the application of comprehensive management strategies has improved the physical and mental health of pullets, which has, in turn, improved the quantity and quality of poultry products. © 2022 by the authors.

It is characterized by the avoidance of situations that are related to the trauma and persistent hyperarousal, which may become associated with anxiety and cognitive disability. The present study evaluated the effects of environmental enrichment on anxietylike behavior and memory in a mouse model of PTSD that employed different reexposures to situational reminders (SRs; 1 or 10 min). Male Swiss mice were exposed or not exposed to environmental enrichment and then subjected to the model of PTSD in a light-dark box. After exposure to the aversive stimulation, the animals were evaluated in a light-dark box, a modified light-dark box, the elevated plus maze (EPM), and the novel object recognition test. Environmental enrichment attenuated the effects of footshock, did not alter anxietylike behavior or memory in animals that were exposed to 1-min SRs, increased anxietylike behavior and memory in animals that were exposed to 10-min SRs, and reversed behavioral sensitization in the EPM. The results suggest that environmental enrichment does not mitigate the effects of reexposure to 1-min SRs on traumatic memory and favors the maintenance of traumatic memories, even when animals are reexposed to SRs for 10 min. However, environmental enrichment reversed the effects of the aversive stimulation on behavioral sensitization.

In sight of the above, a study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Indian instrumental music-based environmental enrichment played in yaman raga on milk production performance and behaviour in cattle. A total of 21 lactating dairy cattle (Vrindavani crossbred cows) having similar parity and stage of lactation were selected in three groups — T1, T2 and T3, each consisting of seven animals. The T1 and T2 groups were exposed to instrumental flute and sitar, respectively, 10 min prior to the start of milking and continued till completion of milking; while the T3 group served as control. Musical enrichment of the environment was done using recorded-tape of flute and sitar was played in yamen raga at 40–60 (dB) decibel intensity. The results revealed a non-significant difference in milk yield, rectal temperature, respiration rate, T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) hormones. However, there exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) difference in milking time, milking speed, cortisol hormones and behavioural parameters such as milk let-down in the animals exposed to music compared to the control group. Thus, the results have significant implications relating to the behavioural fitness and welfare of dairy animals and reducing residual milk. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Cortisol; Environment enrichment; Milk let-down; Milk yield; Music; Stress,hydrocortisone; animal; bovine; dairying; female; lactation; milk; music; pregnancy; procedures; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Hydrocortisone; Lactation; Milk; Music; Pregnancy,,"hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; Hydrocortisone",,,"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, ICAR-IVRI","The authors are grateful for the support, encouragement and guidance received from the Director and all the Joint Directors, ICAR-IVRI, during the trial.",,,,,,,,,,"Abuzead, S.M.M., Khalil, A.M., Behavioral and Physiological Influences of Listening Slow and Fast Music on Milking Buffaloes (2007) Assiut Vet.

Mice were divided randomly into four treatment groups (n=12 each): enriched environment without restraint stress (EN), standard environment without restraint stress (SN), enriched environment with restraint stress (ES), and standard environment with restraint stress (SS). Mice were reared in the respective environment for 45 days. Then, the ES and SS groups were subjected to restraint stress daily (2 h/day) for 14 days, whereas the EN and SN groups were not subjected to restraint stress during this stage. The stress levels of all mice were tested in the elevated plus maze immediately after exposure to restraint stress. After the 2-week stress testing period, mice were administered acute or chronic morphine (5 mg/kg) treatment for 7 days. Then, after a 7-day withdrawal period, the mice were injected with saline (1 ml/kg) or morphine (5 mg/kg) daily for 2 days to observe locomotor activity. The results indicated that the enriched environment reduced the stress and locomotor activity induced by acute morphine administration or saline after chronic morphine treatment. However, the enriched environment did not significantly inhibit locomotor activity induced by morphine challenge. In addition, the stress level did not mediate the effect of the enriched environment on drug-induced locomotor activity after acute or chronic morphine treatment.

The most influential epigenetic human studies are predicated on significant experimental findings in animals that have shown that brain development and function are sculpted by very early or even ancestral experiences. Animal models allow to prospectively manipulate under controlled conditions the exposures to aversive or permissive environment and to evaluate immediate, long-term and transgenerational consequences on candidate gene expression and behavior.

The brain effects of the acute EtOH exposure are well-studied; however, the long-lasting cognitive and neurobehavioral consequences of BD during adolescence are only beginning to be elucidated. Environmental enrichment (EE) has long been known for its benefits on the brain and may serve as a potential supportive therapy following EtOH exposure. In this study, we hypothesized that EE may have potential benefits on the cognitive deficits associated with BD EtOH consumption. Four-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to EtOH following an intermittent 4-day drinking-in-the-dark procedure for 4 weeks. Then they were exposed to EE during EtOH withdrawal for 2 weeks followed by a behavioral battery of tests including novel object recognition, novel location, object-in-place, rotarod, beam walking balance, tail suspension, light–dark box and open field that were run during early adulthood. Young adult mice exposed to EE significantly recovered recognition, spatial and associative memory as well as motor coordination skills and balance that were significantly impaired after adolescent EtOH drinking with respect to controls. No significant permanent anxiety or depressive-like behaviors were observed. Taken together, an EE exerts positive effects on the long-term negative cognitive deficits as a result of EtOH consumption during adolescence. © 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction",alcohol; behavior; binge drinking; cognition; environmental enrichment; therapy,"alcohol; alcohol; central depressant agent; adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; alcohol withdrawal syndrome; anxiety; Article; associative memory; balance disorder; beam walking balance test; behavior disorder; binge drinking; cognitive defect; controlled study; depression; environmental enrichment; exploratory behavior test; light dark box; male; memory test; motor dysfunction; motor function test; mouse; nonhuman; novel object location test; novel object recognition test; object in place test; open field test; priority journal; rotarod test; spatial memory; tail suspension test; young adult; adverse event; animal; animal housing; body equilibrium; C57BL mouse; cognitive defect; complication; darkness; drinking behavior; drug effect; exploratory behavior; illumination; pathophysiology; psychomotor disorder; randomization; sensory dysfunction; Alcohol Drinking; Animals; Binge Drinking; Central Nervous System Depressants; Cognitive Dysfunction; Darkness; Ethanol; Exploratory Behavior; Housing, Animal; Lighting; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Postural Balance; Psychomotor Disorders; Random Allocation; Sensation Disorders",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; Central Nervous System Depressants; Ethanol",,,"SAF2015-65034-R; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Eusko Jaurlaritza: BCG IT764-13; Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU: PI16/ 01698, UFI11/41; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII: RD16/0017/001, RD16/0017/0012","This work was supported by Red de Trastornos Adictivos, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISC-III) ERDF-EU (grant RD16/0017/0012 to P.G.; grant RD16/0017/001 to F.

Indoor housing of cows allows farmers to provide high-yielding individuals with a nutritionally balanced diet fit for their needs, and it has important welfare benefits for both cows and their calves, such as protection from predators, parasites, and exposure to extreme weather conditions. However, it also confronts cows and calves with a wide range of environmental challenges. These include abiotic environmental sources of stress (e.g., exposure to loud and aversive sound) and confinement-specific stressors (e.g., restricted movement and maintenance in abnormal social groups). Cows and calves that live indoors are also faced with the challenge of occupying long periods with a limited range of possible behavioral patterns. Environmental enrichment can improve biological functioning (measured as increased lifetime reproductive success, increased inclusive fitness, or a correlate of these such as improved health), help animals to cope with stressors in their surroundings, reduce frustration, increase the fulfillment of behavioral needs, and promote more positive affective states. Here, we review recent findings on the effect of social, occupational, physical, sensory, and nutritional enrichment on dairy cows and calves, and we assess the appropriateness and practicality of implementing different enrichment practices on commercial dairy farms. Some of the enrichment methods reviewed here may also be applied to those more extensive cattle-raising systems, where similar challenges occur. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.",Animal welfare; Low resilience behaviors; Social enrichment; Zero grazing,"animal; animal housing; animal husbandry; animal welfare; bovine; dairying; female; physiology; procedures; Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Housing, Animal",,,,,"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC: BB/K00042X/1; Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, UFAW","We thank E.

Many monitoring studies of trace element pollution take into account the dust particles located in the plant surface plus the contents of the plant tissues. However, it is usually only the trace element content in the plant tissues that is relevant on plant health. Enrichment factor equations take into account the trace element enrichment of biomasses with respect soil or bedrocks by comparing the ratios of the trace element in question to a lithogenic element, usually Al. However, the enrichment equations currently in use are inadequate because they do not take into account the fact that Al (or whichever reference element) and the element in question may have different solubility-absorption-retention levels depending on the rock and soil types involved. This constrain will become critical when results from different sites are compared and so in this article we propose that the solubility factors of each element are taken into account in order to overcome this constrain. We analysed Sb, Co, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd, Mn, V, Zn, Cu, As, Hg, and Al concentration in different zones of Catalonia (NE Spain) using the evergreen oak Quercus ilex and the moss Hypnum cupressiforme as target species. We compared the results obtained in rural and non industrial areas with those from the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. We observed differences in Al concentrations of soils and bedrocks at each different site, together with the differences in solubility between Al and the element in question, and a weak correlation between total soil content and water extract content through different sites for most trace elements. All these findings show the unsuitability of the current enrichment factors for calculating lithospheric and atmospheric contributions to trace element concentrations in biomass tissues. The trace element enrichment factors were calculated by subtracting the part predicted by substrate composition (deduced from water extracts from soils and bedrock) from total concentrations. Results showed that for most of the trace elements analysed, trace elements enrichment factors were higher inside the Barcelona Metropolitan Area than outside, a finding that indicates that greater atmospheric inputs occur in urban areas. The results show that the most useful and correct way of establishing a reference for lithospheric and atmospheric inputs into the plant tissues is, first, to analyse samples of the same plant species collected from a number of sites possessing similar environmental conditions (climate, vegetation type, soil type) and, second, to use this new enrichment factor obtained by subtracting from the total concentration in plant tissue the predicted contribution of soil or bedrock extracts instead of that of total soil or bedrock concentrations. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",Arsenic; Cadmium; Enrichment factors; Lead; Trace elements,Enrichment factors; Plant tissues; Trace element concentrations; Arsenic; Biomass; Cadmium; Correlation methods; Lead; Tissue; Trace elements; Plants (botany); aluminum; antimony; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; lead; manganese; mercury; nickel; trace element; vanadium; zinc; bioaccumulation; bioindicator; enrichment; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; plant; trace element; article; atmosphere; bioaccumulation; biomass partitioning; climate; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental enrichment; environmental factor; industrial area; moss; nonhuman; oak; plant tissue; rock; rural area; soil analysis; solubility; Spain; species difference; statistical analysis; vegetation; water analysis; Biomass; Bryopsida; Environmental Monitoring; Plant Leaves; Quercus; Soil Pollutants; Spain; Trace Elements; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Bryophyta; Hypnum cupressiforme; Quercus ilex,,"aluminum, 7429-90-5; antimony, 14374-79-9, 7440-36-0; arsenic, 7440-38-2; cadmium, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; chromium, 14092-98-9, 16065-83-1, 7440-47-3; cobalt, 7440-48-4; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; lead, 13966-28-4, 7439-92-1; manganese, 16397-91-4, 7439-96-5; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; nickel, 7440-02-0; vanadium, 7440-62-2; zinc, 14378-32-6, 7440-66-6; Soil Pollutants; Trace Elements",,,"506675, DURSI-DMA-2000; CGL2004-01402/BOS, REN2001-0003/GLO, REN2003-04871/GLO","This research was supported by Spanish Government projects REN2001-0003/GLO, REN2003-04871/GLO, and CGL2004-01402/BOS, the Catalan Government project IMMPACTE (DURSI-DMA-2000), and the European project ALARM (Contract 506675).",,,,,,,,,,"Aceto, M., Abollino, O., Conca, R., Malandrino, M., Mentasti, E., Sarzanini, C., 'The use of mosses as environmental metal pollution indicators' (2003) Chemosphere, 50, pp. 333-342; Alfani, A., Bartoli, G., Caserta, P., 'Amount and elemental composition of dry deposition to leaf surface of Quercus ilex in the urban area of Naples' (1995) Agr.
