AB  - Simple Summary Broiler chickens are conventionally housed in monotonous environments at high stocking densities, which can negatively affect their welfare. This study evaluated the impact of environmental complexity and stocking density on anxiety and fear in broilers. Through behavioral testing, we found that broilers housed at higher densities responded less fearfully than those housed at the lower density, which is contradicting to expectations and previous research. Broilers housed in complex environments exhibited responses consistent with reduced anxiety compared to broilers housed in monotonous environments, suggesting improved welfare for broilers housed in the complex environment. Barren housing and high stocking densities may contribute to negative affective states in broiler chickens, reducing their welfare. We investigated the effects of environmental complexity and stocking density on broilers' attention bias (measure of anxiety) and tonic immobility (measure of fear). In Experiment 1, individual birds were tested for attention bias (n = 60) and in Experiment 2, groups of three birds were tested (n = 144). Tonic immobility testing was performed on days 12 and 26 (n = 36) in Experiment 1, and on day 19 (n = 72) in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, no differences were observed in the attention bias test. In Experiment 2, birds from high-complexity pens began feeding faster and more birds resumed feeding than from low-complexity pens following playback of an alarm call, suggesting that birds housed in the complex environment were less anxious. Furthermore, birds housed in high-density or high-complexity pens had shorter tonic immobility durations on day 12 compared to day 26 in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, birds from high-density pens had shorter tonic immobility durations than birds housed in low-density pens, which is contrary to expectations. Our results suggest that birds at 3 weeks of age were less fearful under high stocking density conditions than low density conditions. In addition, results indicated that the complex environment improved welfare of broilers through reduced anxiety.

AB  - Maternal stress during pregnancy is linked to increased risk for impaired behavioral and emotional development and affective disorders in children. In animal models, acute periods of prenatal or postnatal stress have profound effects on HPA function and behavior in adult offspring. However, few animal studies have determined the impact of chronic exposure to stress throughout the perinatal period. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of chronic maternal stress (CMS) during the 2nd half of pregnancy and nursing on HPA function, locomotor behavior and prepulse inhibition in adult guinea pig offspring, as well as to determine whether environmental enrichment (EE) could reverse the effects of CMS. Guinea pigs were exposed to a random combination of variable stressors every other day over the 2nd half of gestation and from postnatal day (pnd) 1 until weaning (pnd25). Following weaning, offspring were housed in either standard conditions or EE. In both adult male and female offspring, there was no effect of CMS on basal or activated HPA function. CMS significantly increased locomotor activity in an open-field in male offspring, though no effect was observed in females. In female offspring, CMS disrupted PP!: however there was no effect on male PPI. EE had a number of effects on HPA function and behavior but in most cases these were independent of the influence of CMS. EE significantly elevated basal cortisol levels in male offspring at pnd70, whereas in female offspring. EE interacted with CMS to elevate basal cortisol levels from pnd35 to pnd70. In female offspring, EE decreased locomotor activity. In males, EE enhanced PPI; however in female offspring EE disrupted PPI. In conclusion, while CMS had minimal effects on HPA function, there were significant long-term sex-specific effects on behavior. EE did not reverse the effects observed as a result of CMS, but rather modified HPA function and behavior independently of CMS. Further, there was significant interaction of CMS with EE that resulted in elevation of basal HPA function in female offspring. These data, combined with previous studies from our laboratory, suggest that acute phases of maternal stress in late pregnancy may have greater long-term effects on HPA function and related behaviors than prolonged chronic maternal stress.

AB  - Several factors, including environmental modifications, stimulate neuroplasticity. One type of neuroplasticity consists in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Neurogenesis is modulated by environmental enrichment (ENR, tunnels plus running wheel) and affected by the time of exposure to ENR. Despite the wide use of ENR to stimulate neuroplasticity, the degree to which ENR variations modeled by temporally changing the level of environmental complexity affect hippocampal neurogenesis and anxiety is still unclear. Thus, we investigated the effects of five housing conditions on young adult male Balb/C mice exposed for 42 days. The groups were as follows: standard conditions without ENR, constant ENR complexity, gradual increase of ENR complexity followed by a gradual decrease of ENR complexity, gradual increase of ENR complexity followed by constant ENR complexity, and constant ENR complexity followed by a gradual decrease of ENR complexity. On day 44, mice were exposed to the elevated plus-maze to evaluate anxiety. Further, we analyzed neurogenesis and quantified corticosterone levels. In an additional experiment, we explored the effect of voluntary physical activity on anxiety, neurogenesis, and corticosterone during the variations in ENR complexity. Our results showed that any change in ENR complexity over time reduced anxiety. Also, voluntary physical activity alone or in the context of a complex environment increased doublecortin cell maturation in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus. Finally, our study supports that physical activity acts proneurogenic, whereas any change in environmental complexity decreases anxiety-like behavior. However, the decrease in corticosterone levels elicited by physical activity was lower than the decrease produced by the decrement in environmental complexity.

AB  - There is a wealth of evidence demonstrating the benefits of environmental enrichment across a range of different animal species. However, there is comparatively little such research into the effect of enrichment provision on captive reptiles. The aim of this study was therefore to ascertain if an increase in environmental complexity was beneficial to the behaviour and welfare of corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus). The study used a combination of behavioural observations in the home enclosure, behavioural tests of anxiety, and a preference test. The snakes used the enrichment when it was available to them and enriched snakes showed changes in general behaviour reflective of improved welfare. However, the anxiety tests revealed few effects of enrichment provision on performance. In contrast, the snakes exhibited a strong preference for the enriched enclosure when given a choice. These findings suggest that the provision of environmental complexity to the enclosure was beneficial to the behaviour and welfare of captive corn snakes. We therefore recommend enrichment should be used when keeping captive snakes.

AB  - Because broiler chickens are juvenile animals undergoing physical development, stocking density during rearing may influence this development. Some of these physical changes may cause welfare problems, for example, decreased bone quality, which may lead to fracture during catching and transport. Others do not influence welfare directly but can be used as indicators of the animal's ability to cope with its environment (e.g., fluctuating asymmetry). The present study evaluates the effect of stocking density on bone quality and fluctuating asymmetry. Birds were stocked at densities of 2.4, 5.8, 8.8, 12.1, 13.6, 15.5, 18.5, and 21.8 birds/m(2) from 1 until 39 d of age. Increased stocking density had a negative effect on some aspects of bone quality (tibia curvature and shear strength). Tibias were shorter at high density, possibly due to increased curvature. Several other bone quality aspects (tibia weight, torsion, and dyschondroplasia, and femur curvature and epiphysis shape) remained unaffected. Middle-toe length was the only character that showed a significant increase with increasing density when each character was analyzed separately. Nevertheless, a composite index of fluctuating asymmetry, which combined data on all 11 measured characters, tended to increase with stocking density. Such increased fluctuating asymmetry may indicate decreased welfare. However, one of the assumptions of fluctuating asymmetry is that the animal is subjected to the same environmental influences on both sides. This assumption may not be fulfilled when leg deformations occur, as these may lead to asymmetric changes in bone growth by altering the division of force over the 2 legs. In addition, leg deformations decrease the accuracy of bone length measurements made in a straight line. This raises some concerns on the applicability of fluctuating asymmetry measurements on broiler chicken legs, especially because stocking density did not effect the asymmetry of the head.

AB  - Although there have been few demonstrations of a direct empirical relationship between environmental enrichment and reproductive success in captive animals, indirect and anecdotal evidence indicates the importance of physical and temporal complexity for reproduction. We discuss three major mechanisms through which environmental enrichment that specifically increases the complexity of an animal's surroundings may influence reproductive physiology and behavior: developmental processes, modulation of stress and arousal, and modification of social interactions. In complex environments developing animals learn that performing active behavior produces appropriate functional outcomes. Learning to control their environment influences their ability to adapt to novel situations, which may profoundly influence their reproductive behavior as adults in breeding situations. Chronic stress may compromise reproductive physiology and behavior; enrichment reduces stress by providing increased opportunity for behavioral coping responses. However, some degree of acute stress may be beneficial for reproduction by maintaining an animal's level of responsiveness to socio-sexual stimuli necessary for sexual arousal and reproductive activation. Finally, environmental enrichment may influence reproductive success by stabilizing social groups, reducing aggression and increasing affiliative and play behaviors. It is concluded that multi-variate multi-institutional behavioral research in toes will play an increasingly important role in the successful captive propagation of many species by closely examining relationships between environmental variables and reproductive potential of individual animals.

AB  - Challenging early life events can dramatically affect mental health and wellbeing. Childhood trauma and neglect can increase the risk for developing depressive, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. Early maternal separation in rodents has been extensively studied and induces long-lasting alterations in affective and stress responses. However, other developmental periods (e.g., the pubertal period) comprise a critical window whereby social and environmental complexity can exert lasting changes on the brain and behavior. In this study, we tested whether early life environmental complexity impacts affective responses, aggressive behaviors, and expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the synthetic enzyme for nitric oxide, in adulthood. Mice were weaned into social + nonsocial enrichment, social only enrichment, or standard (isolated) laboratory environments and were tested in open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim, and resident-intruder aggression tests 60 days later. Social + nonsocial enrichment reduced locomotor behavior and anxiety-like responses in the open field and reduced depressive-like responses in the forced swim test. Social housing increased open arm exploration in the elevated plus maze. Both social + nonsocial enrichment and social housing only reduced aggressive behaviors compared with isolation. Social + nonsocial enrichment also increased body mass gain throughout the study. Finally, socially-housed mice had reduced corticosterone concentrations compared with social + nonsocial-enriched mice. Behavioral testing reduced nNOS-positive neurons in the basolateral amygdala and the ventral lateral septum, but not in the social + nonsocial-enriched mice, suggesting that environmental complexity may buffer the brain against some environmental perturbations.

AB  - Personality has been identified in a range of animal taxa during the last few decades, with important ecological and evolutionary implications. Investigating the effects of environmental factors during early life can provide important insights into the ontogeny of animal personality. We reared newborn mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, in tanks of different structural complexities, and measured their behavioral traits (i.e., shyness, exploration, and sociability) when they reached sexual maturity. Univariate linear mixed-effects models were fitted to test the effects of environmental complexity and sex on population-average behavior, whereas multivariate models were fitted to quantify behavioral repeatability (i.e., personality) and among-individual correlations (i.e., behavioral syndromes). On average, females were shyer and more social than males, and the fish reared in complex environments were shyer, less explorative, and more social than those reared in open environments. Among-individual differences were consistently large across trials for all behaviors, indicating that personality variation was present in mosquitofish of both sexes reared in different environments. Repeatability did not differ among behaviors, and there were no differences in repeatability in any behavior between sexes or among environments. A negative correlation between shyness and exploration was found in mosquitofish from all treatments at both phenotypic and among-individual levels, with the latter indicating a strong shyness-exploration behavioral syndrome. Our study provides robust evidence that average levels of personality might vary when mosquitofish are raised in different levels of structural complexity during early life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies reported that environmental enrichment might induce various beneficial effects in the central nervous system. However, the effect of environmental factors on endogenous estrogen level was not investigated. The present study was designed to examine the effect of enriched environment on endogenous estrogen in hippocampus and behavioral outcomes.
   METHODS: Behavioural measurements, including open field, elevated plus maze and Morris water maze, were used to evaluate anxiety and learning and memory of the male C57BL/6J mice that were housed in enriched environment for five months. In addition, the estrogen and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus were measured.
   RESULTS: We found that environmental enrichment decreased anxiety-like behaviors and facilitated spatial learning and memory in male C57BL/6J mice. In addition, the mice raised in enriched environment showed decreased endogenous estrogen levels both in the hippocampus and plasma compared to controls. Furthermore, our results indicated that environmental enrichment up-regulated BDNF mRNA expression level in the hippocampus.
   CONCLUSION: In conclusion, environmental enrichment decreased anxiety-like behaviors and facilitated spatial learning and memory in male C57BL/6J mice. Lastly, environmental enrichment up-regulated BDNF mRNA expression level in the hippocampus and decreased plasma estrogen level. The possible mechanism remained to be determined.

AB  - Stress exacerbates several physical and psychological disorders. Voluntary exercise can reduce susceptibility to many of these stress-associated disorders. In rodents, voluntary exercise can reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity in response to various stressors as well as upregulate several brain neurotrophins. An important issue regarding voluntary exercise is whether its effect on the reduction of HPA axis activation in response to stress is due to the physical activity itself or simply the enhanced environmental complexity provided by the running wheels. The present study compared the effects of physical activity and environmental complexity (that did not increase physical activity) on HPA axis habituation to repeated stress and modulation of brain neurotrophin mRNA expression. For six weeks, male rats were given free access to running wheels (exercise group), given 4 objects that were repeatedly exchanged (increased environmental complexity group), or housed in standard cages. On week 7, animals were exposed to 11 consecutive daily 30-min sessions of 98-dBA noise. Plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone were measured from blood collected directly after noise exposures. Tissue, including brains, thymi, and adrenal glands was collected on Day 11. Although rats in both the exercise and enhanced environmental complexity groups expressed higher levels of BDNF and NGF mRNA in several brain regions, only exercise animals showed quicker glucocorticoid habituation to repeated audiogenic stress. These results suggest that voluntary exercise, independent from other environmental manipulations, accounts for the reduction in susceptibility to stress. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate whether environmental enrichment had significant effects on rainbow trout's welfare through nature-, functions- and feeling-based approaches. Fish group behavior was analyzed during the rearing phase, as well as growth performance and health status. We assessed individual's emotional reactivity through a novel-tank test by measuring fear-related behaviors and stress-related physiological responses. Fish boldness and neophobia were then evaluated towards a novel object. We showed that more complex environments decreased aggression levels and improved growth, without impacting fish immune status. Enriched fish were also found less fearful when isolated in a novel tank and bolder when facing a novel object. We concluded that complexifying the environment through the addition of physical structures which stimulate and encourage fish to explore promotes rainbow trout's welfare in farming conditions, according to the three different welfare approaches.

AB  - It has been reported that periodic maternal separation in rats leads to a variety of endure behavioral, neurochemical and microstructural sequelae associated with the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Since it has been proposed that these changes might be permanent, we examined whether environmental complexity aid to recover the structural dendritic impairment induced by neonatal maternal deprivation in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat. In addition, the anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated plus-maze. Repeated maternal separation between postnatal days 6-21 (3 hours daily) significantly reduced the dendritic material in layer II/III pyramidal neurons and induced anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, environmental stimulation (twice a day, I h each) during 12 consecutive days (postnatal days 23-35) failed to recover the neuronal and behavioral disorders induced by neonatal maternal separation. The results demonstrated that (i) neonatal maternal separation severely altered pyramidal dendritic outgrowth in close association with anxiety-like behavior assessed in the elevated plus maze, and (ii) postweaning environmental complexity was unable to recover neither the prefrontocortical neuronal impairment nor the novelty-induced anxiety-like behavior triggered by early maternal deprivation.

AB  - Cognitive processes are often biased by emotions. In humans, affective disorders are accompanied by pessimistic judgement, while optimistic judgement is linked to emotional stability. Similar to humans, animals tend to interpret ambiguous stimuli negatively after experiencing stressful events, although the long-lasting impact on judgement bias has rarely been investigated. We measure judgement bias in female chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) after exposure to cold stress, and before and after exposure to additional unpredictable stressors. Additionally, we explore if brain monoamines can explain differences in judgement bias. Chicks exposed to cold stress did not differ in judgement bias compared to controls, but showed sensitivity to additional stressors by having higher motivation for social reinstatement. Environmental complexity reduced stress-induced negative judgement bias, by maintaining an optimistic bias in individuals housed in complex conditions even after stress exposure. Moreover, judgement bias was related to dopamine turnover rate in mesencephalon, with higher activity in individuals that had a more optimistic response. These results demonstrate that environmental complexity can buffer against negative effects of additive stress and that dopamine relates to judgement bias in chicks. These results reveal that both internal and external factors can mediate emotionally biased judgement in animals, thus showing similarities to findings in humans.

AB  - Properties of the environment play an important role in animal wellbeing and may modulate the effects of external threats. Whereas stressors can affect emotion and impair cognition, environmental enrichment may prevent the occurrence of such negative sequelae. Animals exposed to semi-natural group-housing experience a complex environment; whereas environmental enrichment might protect against stressors, a socially-enriched environment(SEE) could entail aggressive inter-male encounters with additive stress effects. In the present study, we investigated the effects of exposure to external stressors, footshocks and forced swimming, on adrenal gland and body weights as well as on behavior in rats housed under SEE or standard, non-enriched environment (NEE), conditions. We found that SEEs reduced the anxiogenic effects of stress. Moreover, SEEs improved the performance in an operant task and prevented the increase in impulsive behavior produced by external stressors on NEE animals. Whereas these findings are indicative of stress-buffering effects of SEEs, adrenal gland weights were increased while total body weights were decreased in SEE rats, suggesting that SEEs may simultaneously exacerbate physiological measurements of stress. Finally, in the SEE, total aggressive behaviors and body wounds were paradoxically reduced in animals that received external stressors in comparison to non-stressed controls. The consequences of the external stressors applied here are not uniform, varying according to the housing condition and the outcome considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cage stocking density can be manipulated by changing in cage size and group size in the cage. The effects of these two factors were investigated in three developmental stages in male rats: juvenile, post-pubertal, and adult. An open-field test was conducted to measure exploratory behavior which was influenced by levels of activity, anxiety, and exploration. When the cage size was decreased, juvenile rats displayed decreased locomotion and lower propensity for exploration, whereas such changes were not evident in post-pubertal rats. When the group size was increased, adult rats exhibited higher locomotion. However, these factors did not affect risk assessment behavior of rats in these developmental stages. Thus, it appears that the effect of stocking density differs depending on the developmental stage of the animal: Juvenile rats increased anxiety following limiting space, whereas adult rats increased activity following increase in social tension.

AB  - Fish models are essential for research in many biological and medical disciplines. With a typical lifespan of only 6 months, the Turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) was recently established as a time- and cost-efficient model to facilitate whole-life and multigenerational studies in several research fields, including behavioural ecotoxicology. Essential information on the behavioural norm and on how laboratory conditions affect behaviour, however, is deficient. In the current study, we examined the impact of the social and structural environment on a broad spectrum of behavioural endpoints inN. furzeri. While structural enrichment affected only fish boldness and exploratory behaviour, fish rearing density affected the total body length, locomotor activity, boldness, aggressiveness and feeding behaviour ofN. furzeriindividuals. Overall, these results contribute to compiling a behavioural baseline forN. furzerithat increases the applicability of this new model species. Furthermore, our findings will fuel the development of improved husbandry protocols to maximize the welfare ofN. furzeriin a laboratory setting.

AB  - Exposure to an enriched environment (EE) enhances neurogenesis and regulates emotionality. Previous reports have revealed that the rate of neurogenesis can be influenced by various environmental, endocrine, and pharmacologic stimuli. Chronic pain is a debilitating disease state characterized by complex alterations in both peripheral and central nociceptive pathways. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of chronic pain on environmental enrichment-induced hippocampal neurogenesis. Nerve-ligated mice were housed either in a standard environment or in the EE for 4 weeks. EE increased the immunoreactivity for doublecortin (DCX), a marker for immature neuron-positive cells, in the dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, the number of NeuroD (a neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor)-positive cells, in the DG was clearly increased by EE. Under these conditions, chronic pain suppressed enriched environment-mediated induction of both DCX- and NeuroD-labeled cells. These results suggest that chronic pain has stress-like damaging modulatory effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The subgranular zone of the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus contains a pool of neural stem cells that continuously divide and differentiate into functional granule cells. It has been shown that production of new hippocampal neurons is necessary for amelioration of stress-induced behavioral changes by antidepressants in animal models of depression. The survival of newly born hippocampal neurons is decreased by chronic psychosocial stress and increased by exposure to enriched environments. These observations suggest the existence of a link between hippocampal neurogenesis, stress-induced behavioral changes, and the beneficial effects of enriched environment. To show causality, we subjected transgenic mice with conditionally suppressed neurogenesis to psychosocial stress followed by environmental enrichment. First, we showed that repeated social defeat coupled with chronic exposure to an aggressor produces robust and quantifiable indices of submissive and depressive-like behaviors; second, subsequent exposure to an enriched environment led to extinction of the submissive phenotype, while animals exposed to an impoverished environment retained the submissive phenotype; and third, enrichment was not effective in reversing the submissive and depressive-like behaviors in transgenic mice lacking neurogenesis. Our data show two main findings. First, living in an enriched environment is highly effective in extinguishing submissive behavioral traits developed during chronic social stress, and second, these effects are critically dependent on adult neurogenesis, indicating that beneficial behavioral adaptations are dependent on intact adult neurogenesis.

AB  - Simple Summary Environmental complexity can improve chicken welfare. However, the outcome of such environmental changes will depend on the resources provided. We provided either various physical items that posed no biosecurity risk and were inexpensive (such as balls, chains, a perch and rope) to alter behavioral time budgets and interactions with the environment or provided additional visual contact with humans (10 min daily) with the aim to reduce fearfulness. Additional human contact reduced fear of humans at 35 days of age, but did not affect general fearfulness. Increased environmental complexity via the provision of physical items reduced some indicators of fear at 21 days, but not at 35 days of age. A woodblock and perch were the most favored physical items, but chickens preferred to sit underneath the perch rather than on top. When pecking items were not provided, chickens redirected their pecking to the wood shaving litter. Overall, there was little evidence that our physical items improved the chickens' behavioral time budget, fear, physiological stress or production. The benefits of additional visual contact with humans should be investigated on larger groups to ensure that such effects are practical and effective to reduce fear of humans on farm. Increased environmental complexity can improve animal welfare, depending on the resources provided and use by the animal. We provided chickens either with physical items that posed no biosecurity risk and were inexpensive (balls, chains, perches and rope) (P; n = 36) or additional visual human contact (10 min daily) (HC; n = 36) compared to farm-like standard control groups (C; n = 36) with 3 pens per treatment. Additional human contact reduced fear of humans at 35 days of age, but not general fearfulness. P birds required more inductions to induce tonic immobility compared to HC and C birds at 21 days of age. However, other indicators of fear (open field test and plasma corticosterone concentration) did not significantly differ. P birds favored the woodblock for resting, and the perch but preferred to sit underneath the perch rather than on top. When pecking items were not provided, C and HC chickens redirected their pecking behavior toward the litter. Overall, there was little evidence that our physical items improved the chickens' behavioral time budget, fear, physiological stress or production. Additional human contact should be investigated in large scale experiments to ensure its effectiveness to reduce fear of humans on farm.

AB  - This study aimed to develop and characterize a novel (standard) open field test adapted for larval zebrafish. We also developed and characterized a variant of the same assay consisting of a colour-enriched open field; this was used to assess the impact of environmental complexity on patterns of exploratory behaviours as well to determine natural colour preference/avoidance. We report the following main findings: (1) zebrafish larvae display characteristic patterns of exploratory behaviours in the standard open field, such as thigmotaxis/centre avoidance; (2) environmental complexity (i.e. presence of colours) differentially affects patterns of exploratory behaviours and greatly attenuates natural zone preference; (3) larvae displayed the ability to discriminate colours. As reported previously in adult zebrafish, larvae showed avoidance towards blue and black; however, in contrast to the reported adult behaviour, larvae displayed avoidance towards red. Avoidance towards yellow and preference for green and orange are shown for the first time, (4) compared to standard open field tests, exposure to the colour-enriched open field resulted in an enhanced expression of anxiety-like behaviours. To conclude, we not only developed and adapted a traditional rodent behavioural assay that serves as a gold standard in preclinical drug screening, but we also provide a version of the same test that affords the possibility to investigate the impact of environmental stress on behaviour in larval zebrafish while representing the first test for assessment of natural colour preference/avoidance in larval zebrafish. In the future, these assays will improve preclinical drug screening methodologies towards the goal to uncover novel drugs.

AB  - Methods for understanding the neurocircuitry of ethologically relevant behaviors have advanced substantially; however renovations to standard animal laboratory housing, in the form of enhanced enrichment, have lagged behind. This is despite evidence that environmental enrichment (EE) reduces stress, stereotypy, and promotes healthy species typical behaviors. While many scientists express interest for increased EE as a standard for animal caging systems, there are concerns that its effects on brain, behavior, and cognition are not well characterized. In the present study, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were housed for six weeks in either EE, Colony Nesting (CN), or Standard Housing (SD) conditions. We show that adolescent exposure to environmental complexity changed the dynamics of social interactions, sensory processing, and underlying basal stress neurocircuitry, in a sex-and enrichment-type-dependent manner. Specifically, EE and CN increased prosocial engagement and the social saliency of male and female rats while the profile of hippocampal Crhr2 expression was affected only in EE males. Hippocampal Crh was associated with anxiety-like behavior in SD males - this did not extend to EE or CN groups, nor to females. Observations such as these are an important consideration for the validity of translational research investigating the neurocircuitry of stress resiliency, and for understanding the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. Future work must focus on characterizing how individual environmental enhancements (e.g. novelty, social enrichment, physical activity) shape phenotypic differences, how they vary as a function of species, strain and sex, and (if warranted) how to meaningfully implement this knowledge into biomedical research designs.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a powerful way to stimulate brain and behavioral plasticity. However the required exposure duration to reach such changes has not been substantially analyzed. We aimed to assess the time-course of appearance of the beneficial effects of enriched environment. Thus, different behavioral tests and neurobiological parameters (such as neurogenesis, brain monoamines levels, and stress-related hormones) were concomitantly realized after different durations of enriched environment (24 h, 1, 3, or 5 weeks). While short enrichment exposure (24 h) was sufficient to improve object recognition memory performances, a 3-week exposure was required to improve aversive stimulus-based memory performances and to reduce anxiety-like behavior; effects that were not observed with longer duration. The onset of behavioral changes after a 3-week exposure might be supported by higher serotonin levels in the frontal cortex, but seems independent of neurogenesis phenomenon. Additionally, the benefit of 3-week exposure on memory was not observed 3 weeks after cessation of enrichment. Thus, the 3-week exposure appears as an optimal duration in order to induce the most significant behavioral effects and to assess the underlying mechanisms. Altogether, these results suggest that the duration of exposure is a keystone of the beneficial behavioral and neurobiological effects of environmental enrichment.

AB  - Environmental enrichment attenuates hippocampal synaptic injury induced by prenatal stress in offspring. However, the influence of hippocampal synaptic changes and regional differences in prenatal stress remains poorly understood. The present study induced stress in Sprague Dawley rats, which were at gestational age 13-19 days. Following weaning, the offspring were raised in an enriched environment to establish models of stress + enriched environment. Dendritic spine density and synaptophysin expression were detected in hippocampal neurons using Golgi staining and western blot analysis, respectively. Results showed that enriched environment increased dendritic spine density of apical dendrites in CA1 pyramidal cells and basal dendrites of granular cells in the outer layer of the dentate gyrus. In addition, hippocampal synaptophysin expression increased and the effects of prenatal stress on neuronal dendritic spines were reversed in adolescence.

AB  - Methamphetamine alters behavior and the stress response system. Relatively little research has examined the effects of methamphetamine in adolescents and compared these effects to those in adults. Housing in enriched environments has been explored as one way to protect against the effects of methamphetamine, but the findings are conflicting and no study has examined how enriched environment may alter the behavioral and corticosterone responses to methamphetamine in adolescent and adult rodents. We examined the long-term effects of methamphetamine exposure on anxiety, social behavior, behavioral despair, and corticosterone levels in adolescent and adult mice housed in enriched or isolated environments. Enriched environment did not alter the behavioral or corticosterone response to methamphetamine. Methamphetamine exposure decreased anxiety and increased behavioral despair in adult mice, but methamphetamine did not alter behavior in adolescent mice. There was no effect of methamphetamine on social behavior or corticosterone levels. Our findings demonstrate that the specific environmental enrichment paradigm used in this study was not sufficient to mitigate the behavioral effects of methamphetamine and that adolescent mice are relatively resistant to the effects of methamphetamine compared to adult mice.

AB  - This study examined the effects of environmental enrichment on rats exposed to cocaine during the first month of life, in several categories of behavior observed in a forced swim test. Wistar rats were divided in four groups. The first included pups that were subjected to injections of cocaine hydrochloride (15 mg/kg body weight/day, subcutaneously, in two daily doses, from postnatal days I to 27) and reared in an enriched environment (CocEE); the second, pups that were subjected to injections of cocaine (as previously described) and reared in a standard environment (CocSE); the third, pups that were subjected to saline injections and reared in an enriched environment (SalEE); the fourth, pups that were subjected to saline injections and reared in a standard environment (SalSE). On postnatal days 26 and 27, rats were tested in a swimming pool in two 5-min sessions. The categories of behavior studied in this work were: fast swim, slow swim, struggling, diving, and immobility. Results showed that postnatal cocaine exposure decreased the time spent on fast swim during the two sessions and increased the immobility behavior during the second session in CocSE pups compared with SalSE pups. SalEE pups increased the time spent in fast swim, slow swim, and diving, and decreased the time spent in struggling and immobility during the two sessions compared with SalSE pups. CocEE animals spent more time in fast swim and struggling and less the time in immobility compared with CocSE pups. The present results suggest that postnatal cocaine exposure affects the ability of these animals to cope with stressful situations, and that environmental enrichment seems to enable the rats to adopt a more active strategy, one that allows them to better cope with this particular stress situation.

AB  - Environmental manipulation at early critical periods could have long-lasting effects. In spite of the great interest in the biological effects of the environmental condition so far, its long-lasting effects are less documented. This study looks at the enduring effects of rearing condition on tasks that measure affective responses and exploratory behavior in male Wistar rats. The animals were reared from weaning to adulthood in an enriched environment standard laboratory condition, or isolated condition. Then, all rats were housed in standard laboratory cages to provide a common environment, and successively exposed to different tests between 0 and 11 weeks post-manipulation. The open field test indicated a more efficient exploratory behavior in the enriched group, and an enhanced spontaneous motor activity in both standard and isolated groups. In addition, rats reared in standard condition showed heightened motor activity in forced swimming test and elevated plus maze. Forced swimming test showed an antidepressive-like effect in the enriched environment group by increased climbing behavior. In respect to the anxiety behavior, environmental enrichment improved threat detection ability. It is concluded that rearing condition from weaning to adulthood has important and long-lasting effects on depressive- and anxiety-like and exploratory behaviors as well as motor activity.

AB  - Simple Summary The benefits of rearing chicks in complex environments rather than barren environments are well established. However, the typical rearing environments for modern laying hens are still considerably more barren than the complex forest habitat of their ancestors. This small-scale experimental study investigated whether giving chicks of white Bovans Robust the possibility to express choices between different variants of the same resource could result in them being better able to cope with challenges, as well as being better able to make the most of new opportunities. We found that chicks with access to different types of litter and perches were less fearful, less chronically stressed, and were better prepared to cope with pathogenic challenges. Furthermore, they were more successful in a repeated opportunity test, implying an improved learning ability. Overall, the results suggest that rearing laying hen chicks in an environment with access to variation in relevant resources could be a simple and feasible way to increase complexity under commercial conditions. This input could result in them being more resistant to infection and better able to adapt to novel situations later in life. Early experience of a complex environment can improve biologically relevant traits related to coping abilities. However, the mechanisms underlying these positive effects have not been well explored. We hypothesized that giving chicks possibilities to express choices within relevant resources could be an important part of the mechanism, as well as a novel way to increase environmental complexity. In a balanced design, laying hen hatchlings of the white hybrid Bovans Robust were reared in a "single-choice" environment (single litter and perch type) or a "multi-choice" environment (four different litter and perch types). Immunological and behavioral indicators of chicks' coping abilities were explored in this experimental study at three weeks of age. Chicks from "multi-choice" environments had shorter durations of tonic immobility, lower heterophil/lymphocyte ratios, higher natural antibody concentrations, and were more successful in gaining novel food rewards in a repeated opportunity test. These results imply that chicks having access to variation within resource types were less fearful, experienced less chronic stress, would be more able to cope with pathogenic challenges, and potentially had an improved learning ability. To conclude, the more complex environment, achieved by increasing chicks' possibilities to choose, seemed to make chicks better prepared for potential challenges, boosting their adaptive capacities and their ability to make the most of opportunities.

AB  - Adverse environments during early life may lead to different neurophysiological and behavioral consequences, including depression and learning and memory deficits that persist into adulthood. Previously, we demonstrated that exposure to an enriched environment during adolescence mitigates the cognitive impairment observed after maternal separation in a task-specific manner. However, underlying neural mechanisms are still not fully understood. The current study examines the effects of neonatal maternal separation (MS) and postweaning environmental enrichment (EE) on spatial learning and memory performance in a short version of the Barnes Maze, active and passive behaviors in the forced swim test, and on TrkB/BDNF receptor expression in the hippocampus. Our results revealed that MS impaired acquisition learning and that enriched rats performed better than non-enriched rats in acquisition trials, regardless of early conditions. During the probe, enriched-housed rats demonstrated better performance than those reared in standard conditions. No significant differences between groups were found in the forced swim test. Both MS and EE increase full-length TrkB expression, and the combination of MS and EE treatment caused the highest levels of this protein expression. Similarly, truncated TrkB expression was higher in the MS/EE group. Animal facility rearing (AFR) non-enriched groups present the lowest activation of phosphorylated Erk, a canonical downstream kinase of TrkB signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate the importance of enriched environment as an intervention to ameliorate the effects of maternal separation on spatial learning and memory. TrkB/BDNF signaling could mediate neuroplastic changes related to learning and memory during exposure to enriched environment. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social support and a stimulating environment have been suggested to reduce stress reactions and cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to assess the role of environmental enrichment and social interaction for development of atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis prone mice. Male ApoE(-/-) mice were divided into four groups and followed during 20 weeks: (i) enriched environment (E, n = 12), (ii) deprived environment (ED, n = 12), (iii) enriched environment with exercise (E-Ex, n=12) and (iv) socially deprived by individual housing (SD, n = 10). Plasma lipid and cytokine concentrations were measured. Atherosclerosis was quantified in cross-sections of innominate artery and en face in thoracic aorta. Plaque area was significantly increased in SD mice in the innominate artery (P < 0.05 vs. all other groups), but not in the thoracic aorta. Plasma lipids were increased in SD mice (P < 0.001 vs. all for total cholesterol, P < 0.05 vs. E and P < 0.01 vs. ED for triglycerides). Plasma concentration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was decreased in SD mice compared to E mice (P < 0.05). Thus, social isolation increased atherosclerosis and plasma lipids in ApoE(-/-) mice. Reduction in plasma G-CSF levels may hamper endothelial regeneration in the atherosclerotic process. While environmental enrichment did not affect atherosclerosis, social isolation accelerated atherosclerosis.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is an experimental model in which rodents are housed in complex environments that favor lower levels of anxiety-like behavior. PNU-282987 (PNU) is a alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist with beneficial effects on learning though its effects on anxiety are unclear. Our main aim was to carry out a study of its effects in NMRI (n = 96) mice reared in different environments: environmental enrichment (EE), Marlau (TM) cages (MC) and standard environment (SE). After a 4-month period, mice received acute treatment of PNU (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) and were evaluated in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and hole-board (HB). In the EPM, both EE and MC reared mice showed an increase in percentage of entries into open arms while those from EE group differed from SE in time spent on open arms. Mice treated with 2.5 and 10 mg/kg of PNU devoted less time to rearing into open arms. In the HB task, MC mice displayed higher exploratory activity reflected in more head-dips (HD) during the first minute than EE and SE, whereas EE displayed low exploration levels reflected in total HD (5 min). Further research is needed in order to clarify the behavioral effects of this nicotinic agonist in interaction with different environmental conditions.

AB  - Environmental enrichment can modulate mild and chronic stress, responses to anxiogenic stimuli as well as drug vulnerability in a number of animal models. The current study was designed to examine the impact of postnatal environmental enrichment on selectively bred 4th generation high-(HAn) and low-anxiety (LAn) male rats. After weaning, animals were placed in isolated (IE), social (SE) and enriched environments (EE) (e.g., toys, wheels, ropes, changed weekly). We measured anxiety-like behavior (ALB) on the elevated plus maze (EPM; trial 1 at postnatal day (PND) 46, trial 2 at PND 63), amphetamine (AMPH) (0.5 mg/kg, IP)-induced locomotor behavior, basal and post anxiogenic stimuli changes in (1) plasma corticosterone, (2) blood pressure and (3) core body temperature. Initially, animals showed consistent trait differences on EPM with HAn showing more ALB but after 40 days in select housing, HAn rats reared in an EE showed less ALB and diminished AMPH-induced activity compared to HAn animals housed in IE and SE. In the physiological tests, animals housed in EE showed elevated adrenocortical responses to forced novel object exposure but decreased body temperature and blood pressure changes after an air puff stressor. All animals reared in EE and SE had elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-positive cells in the central amygdala (CeA), CA1 and CA2 hippocampal regions and the caudate putamen, but these differences were most pronounced in HAn rats for CeA, CA1 and CA2. Overall, these findings suggest that environmental enrichment offers benefits for trait anxiety rats including a reduction in behavioral and physiological responses to anxiogenic stimuli and AMPH sensitivity, and these responses correlate with changes in BDNF expression in the central amygdala, hippocampus and the caudate putamen.

AB  - In research using animal models, subjects are commonly maintained under standard housing conditions, mainly because of the idea that enhancing welfare conditions could alter experimental data. Another common practice in many laboratories relates to the preponderant use of males. Several reasons justifying this practice include the rapid hormonal and endocrine change in females, which may require a higher number of female animals to achieve more homogenous groups, thereby creating a dilemma with the reduction principle in animal research. In past decades, a relationship between enriched environments and enhanced cognitive functions has been reported in rats, but many of those enriched environmental protocols were not systematically or rigorously studied, leading to unexpected effects on behavior. Here we report the effects of 4 types of housing conditions (standard, structural changes, exercise, and foraging) in Wistar rats on anxiety (elevated plus maze), exploratory (open field), and stress vulnerability (forced swim test) responses. Sex was used as a blocking factor. Data show no effect of housing conditions on anxiety and exploratory behaviors, but do show an effect on stress responses. These results suggest the possibility of using a protocol for environmental enrichment without concern about altering experimental data. From this stand, new ways to enhance animal welfare in research laboratories could be designed and implemented.

AB  - Feline environmental enrichment can prevent numerous disorders including anxiety, stress, obesity, and feline idiopathic cystitis. Despite its easy implementation and low cost, it has received little attention. The main goal of this study was to assess guardians' knowledge concerning feline environmental enrichment and husbandry practices. A questionnaire was given to 130 companion animal guardians at the Lisbon Veterinary Faculty's Teaching Hospital. The applications of 22 environmental enrichment measures related to food/water, litter box, and space/entertainment areas were evaluated. The majority of the households studied (74.6%) had a moderately enriched environment. Hygiene-related measures were those most adopted by guardians, while those requiring guardians' commitment or previous awareness were the least implemented. A rating scale was proposed and applied to assess feline domestic environmental quality.

AB  - Exposure to environmental enrichment can beneficially influence the behavior and enhance synaptic plasticity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mediated effects of environmental enrichment on postnatal stress-associated impact with regard to behavior, stress reactivity as well as synaptic plasticity changes in the dorsal hippocampus. Wistar rat pups were submitted to a 3 h maternal separation (MS) protocol during postnatal days 1-21, while another group was left undisturbed. On postnatal day 23, a subgroup from each rearing condition (maternal separation, no-maternal separation) was housed in enriched environmental conditions until postnatal day 65 (6 weeks duration). At approximately three months of age, adult rats underwent behavioral testing to evaluate anxiety (Elevated Plus Maze), locomotion (Open Field Test), spatial learning and memory (Morris Water Maze) as well as non-spatial recognition memory (Novel Object Recognition Test). After completion of behavioral testing, blood samples were taken for evaluation of stress-induced plasma corticosterone using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while immunofluorescence was applied to evaluate hippocampal BDNF and synaptophysin expression in dorsal hippocampus. We found that environmental enrichment protected against the effects of maternal separation as indicated by the lower anxiety levels and the reversal of spatial memory deficits compared to animals housed in standard conditions. These changes were associated with increased BDNF and synaptophysin expression in the hippocampus. Regarding the neuroendocrine response to stress, while exposure to an acute stressor potentiated corticosterone increases in maternally-separated rats, environmental enrichment of these rats prevented this effect. The current study aimed at investigating the compensatory role of enriched environment against the negative outcomes of adverse experiences early in life concurrently on emotional and cognitive behaviors, HPA function and neuroplasticity markers.

AB  - Our multifactor theory of stress ulcer assumes that environmental factors that operate during early growth stages influence the elaboration of stress ulcer in adult rats. The theory would predict that rats exposed to either neonatal handling, or raised in a stimulus enriched environment, would reveal differences in stress ulcer susceptibility. In study 1, some Wistar rats and ulcer-susceptible Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were handled daily from birth to day 21, whereas other rats from each strain were not disturbed. In study 2, Wistar and WKY rats were raised (3 months) in a large stimulus-dense enriched environment, whereas other rats from each strain were raised in standard rat cages where Visual and auditory stimuli were minimized. At 3 months all rats were observed in the open field test (OFT), a test of emotionality, as well as the Porsolt forced swim test (FST), a test of behavioral depression, and subsequently exposed to the ulcerogenic water restraint procedure. Neonatal handling produced results suggesting increased wall climbing activity in the FST, reduced response latency in the OFT, increased body weight and reduced ulcer severity, but these differences were not significant. Rearing in an enriched environment produced similar results but these difference were more pronounced and significant in the Wistar rats as compared to the WKY rats. Thus early environmental manipulations can influence adult behavior and the elaboration of stress ulcer disease, but the impact of these manipulations is less salient in an organism with an endogenous susceptibility to the disease.

AB  - A direct relation between the rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice and the immobility time in a forced swim test after living in an enriched environment has been suggested previously. In the present work, young adult mice living in an enriched environment for 2 months developed considerably more immature differentiating neurons (doublecortin-positive, DCX+) than control, non-enriched animals. Furthermore, we found that the more DCX+ cells they possessed, the lower the immobility time they scored in the forced swim test. This DCX+ subpopulation is composed of mostly differentiating dentate neurons independently of the birthdates of every individual cell. However, variations found in this subpopulation were not the result of a general effect on the survival of any newborn neuron in the granule cell layer, as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells born during a narrow time window included in the longer lifetime period of DCX+ cells, were not significantly modified after enrichment. In contrast, the survival of the mature population of neurons in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus in enriched animals increased, although this did not influence their performance in the Porsolt test, nor did it influence the dentate gyrus volume or granule neuronal nuclei size. These results indicate that the population of immature, differentiating neurons in the adult hippocampus is one factor directly related to the protective effect of an enriched environment against a highly stressful event.

AB  - It has been shown that exposure to an enriched environment (EE) can modulate the physiological impact of aversive stimuli in animals, promoting adaptive attitudes, as well as the development of resilience to stressful situations. These changes are known to be related to increased levels of some trophic factors, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which has been considered a regulatory protein for synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Our previous studies have demonstrated that in the insular cortex (IC), a brain region of the temporal lobe implicated in the acquisition, consolidation, and retention of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) task, BDNF can reverse the CTA memory deficit caused by a protein synthesis inhibitor. Likewise, our research group have also shown that BDNF is required for the maintenance of CTA long-term memory. Here we evaluate the effects of the exposure to an enriched environment on the CTA memory strength, using a weak and strong version of this paradigm. The exposure to an EE for 21 days was able to attenuate the strong-CTA response through the restoration of BDNF levels in the IC of adult rats. These results provide evidence that environmental enrichment is capable of reducing the strength of an aversive memory trace, restoring the BDNF levels in a neocortical region of the adult brain.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been used as a positive manipulation in different disease models. However, there is conflicting evidence reported in the literature about the effects of EE. Additionally, the time period that would be most beneficial in implementing environmental enrichment as an intervention is not clear.
   Our study aimed to systematically compare the prenatal, juvenile, mid-adolescence, and adulthood developmental trajectory to further the understanding of enriched environment's effects on selective and auditory sustained attention, corresponding to behavioral (conceived) and physiological-reflexive (non-conceived) measures.
   Rats were exposed for 21 days to enriched environment during various developmental periods and compared to age-matched controls. All groups were tested for long-term effects (at postnatal day 120 and onward) on selective and sustained attention.
   We found that the exposure to enriched environment during mid-adolescence has yielded the most significant and long-term pattern of effects, including selective and auditory sustained attention performance, increased foraging-like behavior and a significant decrease in corticosterone level. Similarly, the exposure to EE at juvenile period improved selective attention, increased foraging-like behavior, and reduced anxiety levels as reflected in the open field as well as in low corticosterone levels. These results specify a crucial period along the developmental trajectory for applying environmental enrichment. Mid-adolescence is suggested, in future basic and translational studies, as the sensitive time period that induces the most beneficial and long-term effects of EE on attention.
   The current findings suggest that the exposure to EE during mid-adolescence should be further considered and studied as behavioral alternative intervention, or as adjuvant behavioral therapy, aimed to decrease the probability to develop ADHD in post-adolescence period. This suggestion is highly relevant due to the debate regarding the pros and cons of screens usage (e.g. Facebook, online games, etc.) during early life that decreases environmental enrichment, especially, direct social interaction.

AB  - Flaxseed has a high content of n-3 fatty acids and its intake associated with an environmental enrichment may promote distinct behavioral results upon habituation and animal behavior. This work aimed to evaluating animal behavior under the use of these two tools in the Open Field Test. Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups (n = 6): FEEG, receiving chow made up of flaxseed and kept in enriched environment; FSEG, receiving flaxseed based diet and kept in a standard environment; CEEG, receiving casein based diet and kept in enriched environment; CSEG, receiving casein based chow and kept in standard environment; MCEEG, receiving chow made up of casein but modified so as to provide the same content of fibers and lipids found in flaxseed diet and kept in enriched environment; MCSEG, receiving modified casein based diet and kept in standard environment. All animals were kept under controlled temperature, collective cages and dark/light cycle, receiving chow and water ad libitum, except for MCEEG and MCSEG, which were pair fed with FEEG and FSEG, respectively. Chow intake and animal body weight were evaluated twice in a week. Animals were maintained in these groups from the first until the second month of life, by the time when 3 day tests in Open Field Test began. Finishing the tests, animals were sacrificed and their brains were obtained in order to calculate the relative brain weight. Our results show an interplay between flaxseed and environmental enrichment in habituation to a new environment, making the animals more manageable and less stressed.

AB  - Many studies report differences between animals raised in an enriched environment and those living in standard conditions. Animals reared in enriched conditions demonstrate better memory and learning abilities, increased activity, reduced level of anxiety, etc. However, there is a shortage of studies investigating the impact of environmental variability on animal behaviour, and few studies on this topic focus on animals with different initial anxiety levels.
   This study was conducted on laboratory rats. Prior to the experiment, the rats were kept in three types of rearing conditions: an enriched stable environment; an enriched variable environment; and in standard laboratory conditions. The environment was enriched by providing a cognitively and physically stimulating living space. The variability of the environment involved altering the arrangement of the enriching objects on a daily basis. The level of reaction to food novelty was measured with a food neophobia test.
   The study demonstrates that an enriched environment has a significant impact on reducing food neophobia. However, our findings suggest that the variability of the environment is not necessary and does not enhance the positive impact of enrichment on these aspects of behaviour.

AB  - This study investigated the combined effects of early temperamental characteristics and environmental enrichment on a variety of developmental measures in nursery-reared rhesus monkey infants. Twenty-three infants, reared in either standard laboratory cages or enriched environments, were tested during the lst month of life for interactive, motor, and temperamental capabilities and characteristics. At 8 months of age, all subjects were assessed on a second series of tests designed to measure their problem-solving skills, motor capabilities, and temperamental responses under challenge. Results indicated that enrichment was associated with higher scores on subsequent problem-solving and motor tests. However, such effects were found to combine with early temperament ratings. Specifically, individuals performing best on the 8-month tests had not only been reared in enriched environments, but also had been rated low on fearfulness during the early assessment. In addition, individuals scoring poorest had been rated as fearful initially in addition to being reared without enrichment. Results indicated that while high ratings on early laboratory assessments of fearfulness may be predictive of poorer problem-solving performance under challenging conditions, these adverse effects may be partially attenuated by environmental enrichment.

AB  - Aggression can be modulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we analyse how the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype and the environmental situation in which a contest takes place shape the display of offensive aggression. Therefore, male wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice, which are known to differ in inborn levels of anxiety, were confronted three times with a docile opponent in one of three environmental situations: own territory, opponent's territory or neutral area. The main findings were: The frequency of approaching the contestant in order to gather information about him depended significantly on the venue but not on the genotype with lowest frequencies in the opponent's territory. The decision how quickly to attack the opponent was significantly influenced by the 5-HTT genotype but not by the venue: Homozygous 5-HIT knockout mice showed longest latencies. The sum of offensive aggression was significantly influenced by the 5-HIT genotype, the environmental situation, and a genotype by environment interaction. It is likely that, due to their varying genetic predisposition for anxiety, mice of the three genotypes were differentially affected by the aversiveness of the respective venue and the opponent's behaviour, which influenced their decision to display offensive aggression. As a consequence, the amount of aggression shown by homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice was influenced by the venue and the opponent's behaviour, whereas heterozygotes reacted only to the venue. Strikingly, wildtypes behaved always the same way, irrespective of venue and opponent. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a result of living in an enriched environment, the brain of animals undergoes molecular and morphological changes leading to improvements in learning and memory. These improvements correlate well with increase in neurogenesis, synaptic density, or neurotrophic factors. We review here, in the context of the literature, the experiments performed in our own laboratory on the effects of environmental enrichment on the dynamics of dopamine and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex under a situation of acute mild stress. In these last studies we found that the release of dopamine and acetylcholine under stress is reduced in animals housed in an enriched environment. We also reported that the stress-induced release of dopamine but not acetylcholine is lower in aged rats compared with young rats. These results suggest that environmental enrichment reduces the reactivity to stress of the prefrontal dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in the rat. We further hypothesize that the positive effects on stress coping behaviors of housing animals in an enriched environment are associated with reductions, rather than increases, in the release of dopamine and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex. Finally we propose that a reduction in the stress-induced release of dopamine observed during aging in control animals might be an index of a better adaptation to stressful stimuli.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of enriched environment on spatial memory acquisition in mice of three different age groups. Weanling, young, and young adult female Swiss mice were housed in a standard control or enriched environment for 50 days, and their spatial memory was tested with the Morris Water Maze. We did not observe an experimental effect for spatial memory acquisition, and there was neither an effect of time of analysis nor an interaction between experimental group and time of analysis. Regarding effects of experimental group and training day in relation to latency in finding the hidden platform, we did find an effect in the experimental young adult mice group (p = 0.027), but there was no interaction between these factors in all three groups. Based on these findings environmental enrichment did not enhance spatial memory acquisition in female Swiss mice in the tested age groups.

AB  - Significant loss produces the highest degree of stress and compromised well-being in humans. Current rodent models of stress involve the application of physically or psychologically aversive stimuli, but do not address the concept of loss. We developed a rodent model for significant loss, involving removal of long-term access to a rewarding enriched environment. Our results indicate that removal from environmental enrichment produces a profound behavioral and physiological phenotype with depression-like qualities, including helplessness behavior, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis dysregulation and overeating. Importantly, this enrichment removal phenotype was prevented by antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, the effects of enrichment removal do not occur following relief from chronic stress and are not duplicated by loss of exercise or social contact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Early adverse life experiences have been associated with anxiety-like behavior and memory impairment. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play an important role in brain development. Enriched environments are known to positively influence emotional and cognitive functions in the brain. We examined the effects of maternal deprivation (MD) on NMDAR subunits in the hippocampus, locomotor activity, anxiety behaviors, and learning-memory performance of Balb/c mice. We also examined whether these effects could be reversed by raising the offspring in an enriched environment. The mice were separated from their mothers for a single 24 h episode on postnatal day (PND) 9. The mice were weaned on day 21 and were housed under either standard (SE) or enriched (EE) environmental conditions. Emotional behaviors and cognitive processes of mice were evaluated using an open field (OF) test, an elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and a Morris water-maze (MWM). NMDAR subunits (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) mRNA expression levels in the hippocampus were examined by real-time PCR. In OF, MD had no effect on horizontal locomotor activity. MD increased anxiety-like behaviors in the EPM and decreased spatial learning performance in MWM; however, these effects were not reversed by EE. MD (in SE and EE conditions) increased GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B mRNA expressions in the hippocampus. In conclusion, MD led to the deterioration of the emotional and cognitive processes during adulthood. Moreover, environmental enrichment did not reverse the deleterious effects of the MD on emotional and cognitive functions and increased the NMDAR levels. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We assessed lifelong environmental enrichment effects on possible age-related modifications in emotional behaviors, spatial memory acquisition, retrieval of recent and remote spatial memory, and cholinergic forebrain systems. At the age of 1 month, Long-Evans female rats were placed in standard or enriched rearing conditions and tested after 3 (young), 12 (middle-aged), or 24 (aged) months. Environmental enrichment decreased the reactivity to stressful situations regardless of age. In the water maze test, it delayed the onset of learning deficits and prevented age-dependent spatial learning and recent memory retrieval alterations. Remote memory retrieval, which was altered independently of age under standard rearing conditions, was rescued by enrichment in young and middle-aged, but unfortunately not aged rats. A protected basal forebrain cholinergic system, which could well be one out of several neuronal manifestations of lifelong environmental enrichment, might have contributed to the behavioral benefits of this enrichment.

AB  - Severe and prolonged stress is the main environmental factor that precipitates depression, anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions. On the other hand, exposure to environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to induce progressive plasticity in the brain and improve learning and memory in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. It is not known whether exposure to enriched environment could ameliorate chronic immobilisation stress-induced cognitive deficits and altered molecular markers. Hence, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the effect of enriched environment on chronic immobilisation stress (CIS) associated changes in spatial learning and memory, behavioural measures of anxiety, depression and molecular markers as well as structural alterations. Male Wistar rats were subjected to chronic immobilisation stress for 2 h/day/10 days followed by 2 weeks of exposure to EE. CIS resulted in weight loss, anhedonia, increased immobility, spatial learning and memory impairment, enhanced anxiety, and reduced expression of BDNF, VEGF, GFAP and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in discrete brain regions. Interestingly, stressed rats exposed to enrichment ameliorated behavioural depression, spatial learning and memory impairment and reduced anxiety behaviour. In addition, EE restored BDNF, VEGF, GFAP and GR expression and normalized hypotrophy of dentate gyrus and hippocampus in CIS rats. In contrast, EE did not restore hypertrophy of the amygdalar complex. Thus, EE ameliorates stress-induced cognitive deficits by modulating the neurotrophic factors, astrocytes and glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and amygdala.

AB  - Objectives Social isolation is associated with depression, anxiety, and negative health outcomes. Environmental enrichment, including environmental and cognitive stimulation with inanimate objects and opportunities for physical exercise, may be an effective strategy to include in treatment paradigms for affective disorders as a function of social isolation. In a rodent modelthe socially monogamous prairie volewe investigated the hypothesis that depression- and anxiety-related behaviors after social isolation would be prevented and remediated with environmental enrichment.
   Methods Experiment 1 investigated the preventive effects of environmental enrichment on negative affective behaviors when administered concurrently with social isolation. Experiment 2 investigated the remediating effects of enrichment on negative affective behaviors when administered after a period of isolation. Behaviors were measured in three operational tests: open field, forced swim test (FST), and elevated plus maze.
   Results In isolated prairie voles, enrichment prevented depression-relevant (immobility in FST, group x housing interaction, p = .049) and anxiety-relevant behaviors (exploration in open field, group x housing interaction, p = .036; exploration in elevated plus maze, group x housing interaction, p = .049). Delayed enrichment also remediated these behaviors in isolated animals (immobility in FST, main effect of housing, p = .001; exploration in open field, main effect of housing, p = .047; exploration in elevated plus maze, main effect of housing, p = .001) and was slightly more effective than physical exercise alone in remediating anxiety-relevant behaviors.
   Conclusions These findings provide insight into the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on depression- and anxiety-relevant behaviors using a translational rodent model of social isolation.

AB  - Environmental enrichment has been repeatedly shown to affect multiple aspects of brain function, and is known to improve cognitive, behavioral, and histopathological outcome after brain injuries. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine the effect of an enriched environment on behavioral aberrations observed in male rats exposed to valproic acid on day 12.5 of gestation (VPA rats), and proposed on the basis of etiological, anatomical, and behavioral data as an animal model of autism. Environmental enrichment reversed almost all behavioral alterations observed in the model. VPA rats after environmental enrichment (VPA-E) compared to VPA rats reared in standard conditions have higher sensitivity to pain and lower sensitivity to nonpainful stimuli; stronger acoustic prepulse inhibition; lower locomotor, repetitive/stereotypic-like activity, and enhanced exploratory activity; decreased anxiety; increased number of social behaviors; and shorter latency to social explorations. In comparison with control animals (Con), VPA-E rats exhibited increased number of pinnings in adolescence and social explorations in adulthood, and were less anxious in the elevated plus maze. Similar differences in social behavior and anxiety were observed between control rats exposed to environmental enrichment (Con-E) and control group reared in standard conditions. These results suggest that postnatal environmental manipulations can counteract the behavioral alterations in VPA rats. We propose environmental enrichment as an important tool for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.

AB  - As a validation step of an animal simulation, the effects of environmental enrichment were tested in the anxiety-depression model, in which socially raised chicks are placed in isolation for a 2 h test period. Isolated chicks display an initial high rate of distress vocalizations, constituting the anxiety-like phase, followed by a marked decline and plateau in rates of vocalizations for the remainder of time in isolation, characterizing the depression-like phase. Four separate groups of domestic fowl chicks were group housed under enriched, impoverished (i.e., non-enriched) or a combination of the two housing conditions for six days and tested at 7 d posthatch in the aforementioned isolation procedure. Rates of distress vocalizations in the anxiety-like (2-3 min) or depression-like (30-120 min) phases were not affected by housing conditions. However, chicks continuously housed in enriched environments and chicks housed in the enriched environments on days 4-6 displayed a delay in the onset of the depression-like phase. The beneficial effect of environmental enrichment on the depression-like phase is consistent with other stress paradigms and provides another step towards validating the chick anxiety-depression model as a clinical simulation.

AB  - In human psychology, the link between cognition and emotions is broadly accepted. However, the idea of using the interaction between cognition and emotions as a tool for a better understanding of animal emotions or for welfare assessment is relatively new. The first avian species used in cognitive bias tests was the European starling followed by the domestic chicken and other species. The most frequently used paradigm is the affect-induced judgment bias. There are many variations of the judgment bias tests in birds. The test itself is preceded by discrimination training. Discrimination tasks vary from visual cue discrimination, discrimination of time intervals to spatial location discrimination. During the discrimination training, birds flip or do not flip the lids of the food dishes, and their latency to approach the cues in a straight alley maze, in a two-choice arena, or different locations in spatial judgment task arena are measured. Alternately, the birds fulfill operant tasks in a Skinner box. Before or after the discrimination training phase, birds are subjected to manipulations that are hypothesized to induce positive or negative emotional states. In the last stage, birds are subjected to judgment bias tests. The assumption is that animals in a negative affective state would more likely respond to ambiguous cues, as if they predict the negative event, than animals in a more positive state. However, the results of some avian studies are inconsistent, particularly those studying the effect of environmental enrichment. In starlings, each of the three studies has supplied conflicting results. In poultry, none of the four studies demonstrated a positive effect of environmental enrichment on emotional states. Only the study using unpredictable stressors in combination with environmental complexity showed that animals kept in a more complex environment are more optimistic. Manipulation of the social environment seems to be more effective in judgment bias induction. Conflicting results could be attributable to the design of the tests, the manner of affect induction, or the data analysis. Further optimization and validation of avian cognitive bias tests could help to avoid problems such as the loss of ambiguity. New methods of attention and memory bias testing are promising. However, regardless of the abovementioned complications, a cognitive bias paradigm is a valuable tool, which can help us better understand avian emotions and assess poultry welfare.

AB  - The effect of prenatal malnutrition, produced by protein deprivation, on postnatal neurogenesis of granule cells in the fascia dentata of the rat hippocampal formation was examined by injecting tritiated thymidine on P8 and P15 and sacrificing the pups on P30, or by injecting on P30 and sacrificing on P90. The number of labeled granule cells was significantly decreased in prenatally malnourished rats injected on P8, and unaffected in those injected on P15. In contrast, the number of labeled granule cells in prenatally malnourished rats was significantly increased in animals injected on P30. The study shows that prenatal malnutrition significantly alters the postnatal pattern of granule cell neurogenesis in rat hippocampal formation and that the effect persists despite nutritional rehabilitation at birth.

AB  - Psychopharmacology used animal models to study the effects of drugs on brain and behaviour. The repeated forced-swimming test (rFST), which is used to assess the gradual effects of antidepressants on rat behaviour, was standardized only in males. Because of the known sex differences in rats, experimental conditions standardized for males may not apply to female rats. Therefore, the present work aimed to standardize experimental and housing conditions for the rFST in female rats. Young or adult Wistar female rats were housed in standard or enriched environments for different experimental periods. As assessed in tested and nontested females, all rats had reached sexual maturity by the time behavioural testing occurred. The rFST consisted of a 15-min session of forced swimming (pretest), followed by 5-min sessions at 1 (test), 7 (retest 1) and 14 days (retest 2) later. The oestrous cycle was registered immediately before every behavioural session. All sessions were videotaped for further analysis. The immobility time of female rats remained similar over the different sessions of rFST independent of the age, the phase of the oestrous cycle or the housing conditions. These data indicate that rFST in female Wistar rats may be reproducible in different experimental conditions.

AB  - Postnatal stimuli affect many aspects of physiological and behavioral development. In mice, earlier weaning augments anxiety, putatively as a result of removing mother-pup interactions during the weaning period. Here, we examined the ameliorating effects of social and environmental enrichment on anxiety related to early weaning. Mice weaned at postpartum day 14 were fostered by virgin females, who displayed some nursing behavior during the 1-week fostering period. In elevated plus-maze tests, 10-week-old pups reared with a foster mother spent more time in the open arms than early-weaned mice, and entered into the open arms at a rate between that of normally- and early-weaned mice. Subsequently, the mice from each rearing group were transferred into either standard housing or housing enriched with toys that were changed periodically. Elevated plus-maze tests were conducted again when the mice were 18 and 26 weeks old. The enriched environment increased the duration of time spent in the open arms, but the magnitude of the effect varied with the rearing condition. Furthermore, mice that lived in the enriched environment showed lower activity than those kept in standard housing. These results suggest that fostering after early weaning attenuates increases in anxiety levels, and maternal care during this period may be important in the development of an offspring's emotionality. Environmental stimuli in adulthood may act to blunt the effects deprivation in early life. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Living in an enriched environment (EE) produces a notable impact on several rodent behaviors, including those motivated by drugs of abuse. This picture is somewhat less clear when referring to alcohol-motivated behaviors. With the intent of contributing to this research field with data from one of the few rat lines selectively bred for excessive alcohol consumption, the present study investigated the effect of EE on operant oral alcohol self administration in Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats. Starting from Postnatal Day (PND) 21, male sP rats were kept under 3 different housing conditions: impoverished environment (IE; single housing in shoebox-like cages with no environmental enrichment); standard environment (SE; small colony cages with 3 rats and no environmental enrichment); EE (large colony cages with 6 rats and multiple elements of environmental enrichment, including 2 floors, ladders, maze, running wheels, and shelter). From PND 60, rats were exposed to different phases of shaping and training of alcohol self-administration. IE, SE, and EE rats were then compared under (i) fixed ratio (FR) 4 (FR4) schedule of alcohol reinforcement for 20 daily sessions and (ii) progressive ratio (PR) schedule of alcohol reinforcement in a final single session. Acquisition of the lever-responding task (shaping) was slower in EE than IE and SE rats, as the likely consequence of a "devaluation" of the novel stimuli provided by the operant chamber in comparison to those to which EE rats were continuously exposed in their homecage or an alteration, induced by EE, of the rat "emotionality" state when facing the novel environment represented by the operant chamber. Training of alcohol self-administration was slower in EE than IE rats, with SE rats displaying intermediate values. A similar ranking order (IE>SE>EE) was also observed in number of lever-responses for alcohol, amount of self-administered alcohol, and breakpoint for alcohol under FR4 and PR schedules of reinforcement. These data suggest that living in a complex environment reduced the reinforcing and motivational properties of alcohol in sP rats. These results are interpreted in terms of the reinforcing and motivational properties of the main components of EE (i.e., social interactions, physical activities, exploration, novelty) substituting, at least partially, for those of alcohol.

AB  - Adverse events in early life have been related to a maladaptive stress response during adulthood, which could predispose individuals to psychiatric and physiological disorders. The purpose of this work was to study the implications of repeated maternal separation (RMS) plus a physical stressor (cold stress), voluntary ethanol consumption and plasmatic levels of corticosterone (Cor) via conflict behavior tests. To this aim, pups were separated daily from their mothers for one hour and subjected to cold stress (4 degrees C) between postnatal days (PD) 2 and 20. Control groups were left undisturbed with their mothers. Afterwards, all groups were exposed to voluntary ethanol (6%) or dextrose (1%) intake for 7 days. After a 30-day period of environmental enrichment (EE), the animals were again exposed to the voluntary intake protocol for 7 days. At 66 days, they were subjected to different conflict tests. Thereafter, rats were sacrificed by decapitation and blood trunk was collected to determine plasma corticosterone levels. We demonstrated that early RMS increased both voluntary alcohol intake and Cor levels. Moreover, young adult animals showed excessive activity in conflict tests. Whereas in animals exposed to a non-pharmacological treatment, known as environmental enrichment (EE), the effects previously obtained were reversed and/or prevented. In summary, we can conclude that the combination of maternal separation in early life plus cold stress increase both the voluntary exposure to alcohol and disruptive behaviors. This is a risk factor for the development of chronic diseases such as alcoholism and long-term depression. However, we found that an enriched environment may have a beneficial effect with respect to alcohol intake and aggressive behaviors.

AB  - Anxiety and aggression are part of the behavioral repertoire of humans and animals. However, in their exaggerated form both can become maladaptive and result in psychiatric disorders. On the one hand, genetic predisposition has been shown to play a crucial modulatory role in anxiety and aggression. On the other hand, social experiences have been implicated in the modulation of these traits. However, so far, mainly experiences in early life phases have been considered crucial for shaping anxiety -like and aggressive behavior, while the phase of adolescence has largely been neglected. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to elucidate how levels of anxiety -like and aggressive behavior are shaped by social experiences during adolescence and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype. For this purpose, male mice of a 5-HTT knockout mouse model including all three genotypes (wildtype, heterozygous and homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice) were either exposed to an adverse social situation or a beneficial social environment during adolescence. This was accomplished in a custom-made cage system where mice experiencing the adverse environment were repeatedly introduced to the territory of a dominant opponent but had the possibility to escape to a refuge cage. Mice encountering beneficial social conditions had free access to a female mating partner. Afterwards, anxiety -like and aggressive behavior was assessed in a battery of tests. Surprisingly, unfavorable conditions during adolescence led to a decrease in anxiety -like behavior and an increase in exploratory locomotion. Additionally, aggressive behavior was augmented in animals that experienced social adversity. Concerning genotype, homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice were more anxious and less aggressive than heterozygous 5-HTT knockout and wildtype mice. In summary, adolescence is clearly an important phase in which anxiety-like and aggressive behavior can be shaped. Furthermore, it seems that having to cope with challenge during adolescence instead of experiencing throughout beneficial social conditions leads to reduced levels of anxiety -like behavior.

AB  - Chronic morphine exposure during puberty increased morphine-induced rewarding effects and sensitization in the next generation. Given the well-known beneficial effects of environmental enrichment on the severity of physical and psychological dependence on morphine, we examined effects of enriched environment during morphine abstinence in morphine dependent parental rats before mating on the anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, and voluntary morphine consumption in their offspring. Paternal and/or maternal rats were injected with bi-daily doses (10 mg/kg, 12 h intervals) of morphine for 14 days followed by rearing in a standard environment (SE) or enriched environment (EE) during 30 days of morphine abstinence before mating. The pubertal male and female rat offspring were tested for anxiety (the elevated plus maze- EPM) and depression (sucrose preference test-SPT), and voluntary morphine consumption using a two-bottle choice (TBC) paradigm. The results showed that EE experience in morphine-dependent both parents result in an increase in the percentage of time spent into open arms/time spent on both arms using EPM in male offspring, higher levels of sucrose preference in female offspring and lower levels of voluntary morphine consumption in male and female offspring. Thus, EE experience in morphine-dependent both parents reduced anxiety, depressive-like behavior and also the voluntary morphine consumption in their offspring during puberty which may prevent the vulnerability of the next generation to drug abuse.

AB  - One hallmark of psychiatric conditions is the vast continuum of individual differences in susceptibility vs. resilience resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The environmental enrichment paradigm is an animal model that is useful for studying a range of psychiatric conditions, including protective phenotypes in addiction and depression models. The major question is how environmental enrichment, a non-drug and non-surgical manipulation, can produce such robust individual differences in such a wide range of behaviors. This paper draws from a variety of published sources to outline a coherent hypothesis of inoculation stress as a factor producing the protective enrichment phenotypes. The basic tenet suggests that chronic mild stress from living in a complex environment and interacting non-aggressively with conspecifics can inoculate enriched rats against subsequent stressors and/or drugs of abuse. This paper reviews the enrichment phenotypes, mulls the fundamental nature of environmental enrichment vs. isolation, discusses the most appropriate control for environmental enrichment, and challenges the idea that cortisol/corticosterone equals stress. The intent of the inoculation stress hypothesis of environmental enrichment is to provide a scaffold with which to build testable hypotheses for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these protective phenotypes and thus provide new therapeutic targets to treat psychiatric/neurological conditions.

AB  - Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs), also known as associative effects, are the heritable effects that an individual has on the phenotype of its social partners. Selection for IGEs has been proposed as a method to reduce harmful behaviours, in particular aggression, in livestock and aquaculture. The mechanisms behind IGEs, however, have rarely been studied. The objective was therefore to assess aggression in pigs which were divergently selected for IGEs on growth (IGEg). In a one generation selection experiment, we studied 480 offspring of pigs (Sus scrofa) that were selected for relatively high or low IGEg and housed in homogeneous IGEg groups in either barren or enriched environments. Skin lesion scores, a proxy measure of aggression, and aggressive behaviours were recorded. The two distinct IGEg groups did not differ in number of skin lesions, or in amount of reciprocal fighting, both under stable social conditions and in confrontation with unfamiliar pigs in a 24 h regrouping test. Pigs selected for a positive effect on the growth of their group members, however, performed less non-reciprocal biting and showed considerably less aggression at reunion with familiar group members after they had been separated during a 24 h regrouping test. The enriched environment was associated with more skin lesions but less non-reciprocal biting under stable social conditions. Changes in aggression between pigs selected for IGEg were not influenced by GxE interactions with regard to the level of environmental enrichment. It is likely that selection on IGEg targets a behavioural strategy, rather than a single behavioural trait such as aggressiveness.

AB  - Enriched environments and exercise provide complex environmental stimulation that can induce emotional and cognitive changes; however, few studies have evaluated the effects of these two components on other behaviours, such as novelty seeking or pain sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of voluntary physical activity provided through different housing conditions on anxiety, locomotor activity, pain sensitivity, and exploration. Male mice at postnatal day (PND) 21 and were randomly assigned to one of four different conditions on PND 28: Marlau cages (MC), a standardized cage designed to provide a complex environment; physical exercise in large groups (PE-8); physical exercise in small groups (PE-4); or a standard environment (SE). After seven weeks, animals were evaluated in the hole-board task, the elevated zero maze, actimeter, and hot plate test. In the hole-board task, MC animals displayed more exploration than animals in the PE-8 and PE-4 groups, but no significant differences were observed between groups in the actimeter. In the elevated zero maze, MC and PE-8 animals exhibited an anxiogenic-like profile as compared to the SE group. When pain sensitivity was evaluated, the PE-8 group displayed a higher sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli than the SE group. These data suggest that the complexity of the environment in which physical activity and environmental stimulation are provided can influence animal behaviours such as novelty seeking, emotional response, and pain sensitivity. These animal models could be useful for designing more personalized interventions that include physical, social, and cognitive stimulation to promote a more active lifestyle in humans. Such interventions could be useful in the prevention and treatment of aging-related decline or neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - In this study, we investigate whether and how arena design of emergence tests (a commonly used boldness assay where the latency to emerge from a start box is measured) can affect the behaviour of the subject animals. We used two populations of wild brown trout fry, captured on their hatching grounds, and measured emergence latency in arenas with two different sizes of start-box gates and two different environments into which the fish emerges from the start box (barren and complex), in a factorial design. We found that arena design affected the behaviour of the fish, but only in one of the populations. In the affected population, a large start-box gate in combination with a barren environment reduced emergence latency. Furthermore, the time from leaving the box until entering another compartment on the opposite side of the arena was shorter in a barren environment as compared to a more complex environment. We also found that smaller brown trout fry generally showed lower tendency for emerging from the start box at all. The results of this study suggest that direct comparisons among results from experiments using different arena designs may be problematic and highlight the importance of reporting details of arena design in publications.

AB  - Twenty-two rats were reared in standard conditions during the first two months of their life. Then the animals were divided into two groups exposed to different rearing conditions. Twelve animals (Group SO) were housed socially, six animals per cage, and for three weeks they were subjected to sensory stimulation in an enriched environment. The other ten subjects were kept individually (Group IN); one rat per mesh cage, in conditions of relatively impoverished sensory stimulation. In both groups the training of the conditioned emotional response (CER) was performed when animals were three months old. In contrast to IN subjects, the rats subjected to permanent social contacts and reared in the enriched environment (Group SO) revealed almost equally low instrumental response rates in trials with the conditioned stimulus (CS), paired with nociceptive foot-shock (US), and in periods when no CS and/or US were applied. The results suggested that early exposure to an enriched environment caused a later decrease of the animals' capability to differentiate between the aversive CS and cues of the experimental context. This cognitive impairment was probably a secondary effect of fear generalized to the entire experimental situation.

AB  - The field of behavioral neuroscience has been successful in using an animal model of enriched environments for over five decades to measure the rehabilitative and preventative effects of sensory, cognitive and motor stimulation in animal models. Several key principles of enriched environments match those used in sensory integration therapy, a treatment used for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. This paper reviews the paradigm of environmental enrichment, compares animal models of enriched environments to principles of sensory integration treatment, and discusses applications for the rehabilitation of neurodevelopmental disorders. Based on this review, the essential features in the enriched environment paradigm which should be included in sensory integration treatment are multiple sensory experiences, novelty in the environment, and active engagement in challenging cognitive, sensory, and motor tasks. Use of sensory integration treatment may be most applicable for children with anxiety, hypersensitivity, repetitive behaviors or heightened levels of stress. Additionally, individuals with deficits in social behavior, social participation, or impairments in learning and memory may show gains with this type of treatment.

AB  - The effects of environment enrichment on motor activity, exploration, and cognitive performances were studied in aged rats. Both nonimpaired (NI) and impaired (I) rats were submitted to daily training in a complex-enriched environment (cEE) for 60 days. Animals were examined at spatial water maze task, passive avoidance test, open-field test, and sensorimotor coordination tasks (bridges test and Marshall scales). At the end of experiments, animals were killed for brain biochemical determinations (gluthatione content and specific-ChAT activity). Results after the first evaluation (before training) corroborate that the aged rat population showed a heterogeneity in behavioral patterns like that observed in humans. Also, cEE modified exploration activity, cognition, motor functions, and biochemical markers in both NI and I groups, but changes reached significant relevance for the last group. It is significant that neurotrophins, "novo" synthesis of neurotransmitters, and oxidative stress levels may mediate the observed changes, indicating that the aged brain still has appreciable plasticity in response to well-manipulated environmental stimulation. Finally, our results also support the novel concepts and programs in prevention/reduction both in incidence/severity and outcome of age-associated neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Based on sex, rats were randomly assigned to either an enriched or standard environment for 30 days prior to behavioral testing. The predator stress testing consisted of placing the rat in a cat avoidance apparatus so that the rat's behavioral response to a natural stressor, the cat, could be assessed. The rats were subsequently exposed to a partial predator stimulus (cat urine) that was placed in the home cages for 7 days. Each animal was then sacrificed and the stomach, adrenal glands, and thymus gland were removed and assessed. Results indicated that 1) the enriched rats engaged in less defensive behavior than the standard rats during behavioral testing, 2) female rats demonstrated more defensive behavioral patterns compared to male rats, and 3) the enriched environment affected females more than males, as evidenced by the interaction effects on various recorded behaviors.

AB  - The manner in which laboratory rodents are housed is driven by economics (minimal use of space and resources), ergonomics (ease of handling and visibility of animals), hygiene, and standardization (reduction of variation). This has resulted in housing conditions that lack sensory and motor stimulation and restrict the expression of species-typical behavior. In mice, such housing conditions have been associated with indicators of impaired welfare, including abnormal repetitive behavior (stereotypies, compulsive behavior), enhanced anxiety and stress reactivity, and thermal stress. However, due to concerns that more complex environmental conditions might increase variation in experimental results, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of environmental enrichment beyond the provision of nesting material. Here, using 96 C57BU6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies: (1) bedding alone; (2) bedding + nesting material; (3) deeper bedding + nesting material + shelter + increased vertical space; and (4) semi-naturalistic conditions, including weekly changes of enrichment items. We studied how these different forms of environmental enrichment affected measures of animal welfare, including homecage behavior (time-budget and stereotypic behavior), anxiety (open field behavior, elevated plus-maze behavior), growth (food and water intake, body mass), stress physiology (glucocorticoid metabolites in fecal boluses and adrenal mass), brain function (recurrent perseveration in a two-choice guessing task) and emotional valence (judgment bias). Our results highlight the difficulty in making general recommendations across common strains of mice and for selecting enrichment strategies within specific strains. Overall, the greatest benefit was observed in animals housed with the greatest degree of enrichment. Thus, in the super-enriched housing condition, stereotypic behavior, behavioral measures of anxiety, growth and stress physiology varied in a manner consistent with improved animal welfare compared to the other housing conditions with less enrichment. Similar to other studies, we found no evidence, in the measures assessed here, that environmental enrichment increased variation in experimental results.

AB  - Understanding the effects of environmental stimulation in autism can improve therapeutic interventions against debilitating sensory overload, social withdrawal, fear and anxiety. Here, we evaluate the role of environmental predictability on behavior and protein expression, and inter-individual differences, in the valproic acid (VPA) model of autism. Male rats embryonically exposed (E11.5) either to VPA, a known autism risk factor in humans, or to saline, were housed from weaning into adulthood in a standard laboratory environment, an unpredictably enriched environment, or a predictably enriched environment. Animals were tested for sociability, nociception, stereotypy, fear conditioning and anxiety, and for tissue content of glutamate signaling proteins in the primary somatosensory cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, and of corticosterone in plasma, amygdala and hippocampus. Standard group analyses on separate measures were complemented with a composite emotionality score, using Cronbach's Alpha analysis, and with multivariate profiling of individual animals, using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. We found that predictable environmental enrichment prevented the development of hyper-emotionality in the VPA-exposed group, while unpredictable enrichment did not. Individual variation in the severity of the autistic-like symptoms (fear, anxiety, social withdrawal and sensory abnormalities) correlated with neurochemical profiles, and predicted their responsiveness to predictability in the environment. In controls, the association between socio-affective behaviors, neurochemical profiles and environmental predictability was negligible. This study suggests that rearing in a predictable environment prevents the development of hyper-emotional features in animals exposed to an autism risk factor, and demonstrates that unpredictable environments can lead to negative outcomes, even in the presence of environmental enrichment.

AB  - Our previous results demonstrated improved cognition in adolescent rats housed in environmental enrichment (EE) that underwent neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of early EE on neurobehavioral development and brain damage in rats submitted to neonatal HI. Wistar rats were submitted to the HI procedure on the 7th postnatal day (PND) and housed in an enriched environment (8th-20th PND). The maturation of physical characteristics and the neurological reflexes were evaluated and the volume of striatum, corpus callosum and neocortex was measured. Data analysis demonstrated a clear effect of EE on neurobehavioral development; also, daily performance was improved in enriched rats on righting, negative geotaxis and cliff aversion reflex. HI caused a transient motor deficit on gait latency. Brain atrophy was found in HI animals and this damage was partially prevented by the EE. In conclusion, early EE stimulated neurobehavioral development in neonate rats and also protects the neocortex and the corpus callosum from atrophy following HI. These findings reinforce the potential of EE as a strategy for rehabilitation following neonatal HI and provide scientific support to the use of this therapeutic strategy in the treatment of neonatal brain injuries in humans.

AB  - Boredom is an emotional state that occurs when an individual has nothing to do, is not interested in the surrounding, and feels dreary and in a monotony. While this condition is usually defined for humans, it may very well describe the lives of many laboratory animals housed in small, barren cages. To make the cages less monotonous, environmental enrichment is often proposed. Although housing in a stimulating environment is still used predominantly as a luxury good and for treatment in preclinical research, enrichment is increasingly recognized to improve animal welfare. To gain insight into how stimulating environments influence the welfare of laboratory rodents, we conducted a systematic review of studies that analyzed the effect of enriched environment on behavioral parameters of animal well-being. Remarkably, a considerable number of these parameters can be associated with symptoms of boredom. Our findings show that a stimulating living environment is essential for the development of natural behavior and animal welfare of laboratory rats and mice alike, regardless of age and sex. Conversely, confinement and under-stimulation has potentially detrimental effects on the mental and physical health of laboratory rodents. We show that boredom in experimental animals is measurable and does not have to be accepted as inevitable.

AB  - Seahorses are considered one of the most iconic examples of a monogamous species in the animal kingdom. This study investigates the relationship between stocking density and mating and competitive behavior from the context of the field biology of the dwarf seahorse, Hippocampus zosterae (Jordan & Gilbert). Animals were housed in 38 liter tanks at a range of densities and sex ratios (from 2-8 animals per tank), and their reproductive and other social behaviors were monitored from tank introduction through copulation. At low tank densities and even sex ratios but comparatively high field densities, frequency of both mating and competitive behaviors was low in trials. A higher level of males in tanks across all densities increased competition, activity levels, and aggression leading to egg transfer errors and brood expulsion, resulting in lower reproductive success. Across seahorse species, mean and maximum wild densities were consistently lower than those used in ex situ breeding, with adult sex ratios that were significantly female biased. However, significant variation exists in wild seahorse densities across species, with higher densities detected in focal/mark recapture studies and on artificial habitat structures than reported with belt transect sampling techniques. Interchange of knowledge gained in both aquarium and wild contexts will allow us to better understand the biology of this genus, and improve reproduction in captivity. Interpreting ex situ reproductive behaviors of seahorses within various densities reported from natural populations will help us predict the impact of conservation efforts and increase the likelihood of long-term persistence of populations for this threatened genus.

AB  - Environmental enrichment of laboratory animals influences brain plasticity, stimulates neurogenesis, increases neurotrophic factor expression, and protects against the effects of brain insult. However, these positive effects are not constantly observed, probably because standardized procedures of environmental enrichment are lacking. Therefore, we engineered an enriched cage (the Marlau (TM) cage), which offers: (1) minimally stressful social interactions; (2) increased voluntary exercise; (3) multiple entertaining activities; (4) cognitive stimulation (maze exploration), and (5) novelty (maze configuration changed three times a week). The maze, which separates food pellet and water bottle compartments, guarantees cognitive stimulation for all animals. Compared to rats raised in groups in conventional cages, rats housed in Marlau (TM) cages exhibited increased cortical thickness, hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal levels of transcripts encoding various genes involved in tissue plasticity and remodeling. In addition, rats housed in Marlau (TM) cages exhibited better performances in learning and memory, decreased anxiety-associated behaviors, and better recovery of basal plasma corticosterone level after acute restraint stress. Marlau (TM) cages also insure inter-experiment reproducibility in spatial learning and brain gene expression assays. Finally, housing rats in Marlau (TM) cages after severe status epilepticus at weaning prevents the cognitive impairment observed in rats subjected to the same insult and then housed in conventional cages. By providing a standardized enriched environment for rodents during housing, the Marlau (TM) cage should facilitate the uniformity of environmental enrichment across laboratories.

AB  - Background: Environmental Enrichment (EE) has been suggested as a possible therapeutic intervention for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Although the benefits of this therapeutic method have been reported in some animal models and human studies, the unknown pathophysiology of autism as well as number of conflicting results, urge for further examination of the therapeutic potential of EE in autism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of environmental enrichment on autism-related behaviors which were induced in the maternal separation (MS) animal model. Material and Methods: Maternally separated (post-natal day (PND) 1-14, 3 h/day) and control male rats were at weaning (PND21) age equally divided into rats housed in enriched environment and normal environment. At adolescence (PND42-50), the four groups were behaviorally tested for direct social interaction, sociability, repetitive behaviors, anxiety behavior, and locomotion. Following completion of the behavioral tests, the blood and brain tissue samples were harvested in order to assess plasma level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and structural plasticity of brain using ELISA and stereological methods respectively. Results: We found that environmental enrichment reduced repetitive behaviors but failed to improve the impaired sociability and anxiety behaviors which were induced by maternal separation. Indeed, EE exacerbated anxiety and social behaviors deficits in association with increased plasma BDNF level, larger volume of the hippocampus and infra-limbic region and higher number of neurons in the infra-limbic area (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that environmental enrichment has a significant improvement effect on the repetitive behavior as one of the core autistic-like behaviors induced by maternal separation but has negative effect on the anxiety and social behaviors which might have been modulated by BDNF.

AB  - In most studies regarding the improving or therapeutical effects induced by enriched environment (EE), EE was performed after the stress treatment or in patients with certain diseases. In the current study, the effects of chronic restraint stress (6 h/day) in mice living in an enriched environment or standard environment (SE) were tested. Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: non-stressed or stressed mice housed in SE or EE conditions (SE, stress + SE, EE, stress + EE). Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle was tested after the 2 weeks or 4 weeks stress and/or EE treatment and 1 or 2 weeks withdrawal from the 4 weeks treatment. After the 4 weeks treatment, spatial recognition memory in Y-maze was also tested. The results showed that EE increased PPI in stressed and non-stressed mice after 2 weeks treatment. No effect of EE on PPI was found after the 4 weeks treatment. 4 weeks chronic restraint stress increased PPI in mice housed in standard but not EE conditions. Stressed mice showed deficits on the 1 h delay version of the Y-maze which could be prevented by living in an enriched environment. Our results indicated that living in an enriched environment reversed the impairing effects of chronic restraint stress on spatial recognition memory. However, EE did not change the effects of stress on PPI. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental stimulation throughout development adjusts the neurobehavioral systems involved in learning, memory and defensive responses. Environment-mediated phenotypic plasticity can be considered from two different, yet complementary, viewpoints. On one hand, the possibility that environmental interventions protect against the effects of genetic and/or acquired vulnerabilities, offers unprecedented avenues towards the elaboration and refinement of therapeutic strategies. On the other hand, an accurate understanding of the adaptive mechanisms regulating the interaction between an experimental subject and its environment may substantially benefit the quality of experimental data. Here we review experimental evidence showing that enriched environment can be beneficial in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders implicating the monoamine systems where it can (i) compensate for impairments in animal models of schizophrenia, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases; (ii) increase resistance to the addictive properties of psychostimulant drugs; (iii) level-out the consequences of prenatal stress in animal models of depression. Additionally we discuss why some of the effects of environmental enrichment question the validity Of Current animal models of mental disorders. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The payoffs of an individual's behaviour vary with changing environmental conditions. Animals often modify their behaviours according to those environmental conditions (i.e. plasticity), but also retain consistent individual differences across environmental change (i.e. personality). These patterns of behavioural variation are often measured with respect to a single environmental variable, which raises the question of how individuals respond to change in combinations of environmental variables, and whether individual differences in behaviour persist across change in multiple variables. Furthermore, an individual's amount of plasticity in response to a change in one environmental variable may or may not be repeatable across change in a second environmental variable. To answer these questions, we experimentally manipulated combinations of mating, foraging and predation risk to determine their effect on the antipredator behaviour of male Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi. We found that the combination of environmental variables had an interactive effect on antipredator behaviour, but among-individual variation persisted along with within-individual variation in behaviour. The plasticity of squirrels' responses to change in one environmental variable, such as change in antipredator behaviour from high to low predation risk, was repeatable when measured in a mating environment and foraging environment, and vice versa. These results demonstrate patterns of behavioural variation across complex environments such as animals encounter in nature, and point towards the benefit of addressing greater environmental complexity in studies of animal behaviour.

AB  - The post-weaning social environment has profound effects on behavior and physiology in rodents. Social isolation increases anxiety-like behaviors and novelty-induced locomotor activity, while environmental enrichment decreases these behaviors. In some cases, the effects of social isolation are ameliorated by repeated handling. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the effects of handling differ in rats reared in social isolation and those reared in an enriched environment. After weaning, male Long-Evans rats were housed individually (ISO)(3) or in groups in an enriched environment (FE). During adulthood, rats from each housing condition received four, once-daily, brief handling sessions or remained undisturbed in the home cage. All rats were then tested in the open field, elevated plus maze, and for behavioral responses to D-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg). EE rats spent more time on the open arms of the elevated plus maze and were more likely than ISO rats to emerge from the start box in the open field, suggesting lower anxiety. Handling significantly decreased open arm time in EE rats and marginally increased open arm time in ISO rats. Housing condition did not affect amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity, but handling altered the time course of the amphetamine response. ISO rats exhibited significantly fewer stereotyped behaviors than did EE rats, but repeated handling eliminated this difference. These findings support previously published studies that suggest brief handling of adult rats may at least partially ameliorate the effects of post-weaning social isolation on anxiety-like behaviors and psychostimulant sensitivity. Furthermore, there are complex interactions between the effects of housing environment and handling, suggesting that handling may be perceived and/or processed differently, depending on the animal's housing environment.

AB  - Stress can influence the secretion of neuroendocrine mediators, thereby exposing immune cells to altered signaling and interactions. Here we investigated the synergetic effect of stress and environmental enrichment on the immune response of Long-Evans rats. Subjects (n = 46) were assigned to 5 treatment groups: acute compared with chronic stress with or without environmental enrichment, plus an unmanipulated control group. Animals also were classified as active, passive, and flexible copers according to back-test assessment. Rats were exposed to enrichment in an open-field containing objects in different areas for 30 min 3 times each week, thus modeling the effects of a temporary increase in environmental stimuli. Animals assigned to chronic stress groups were exposed to predator sound stressors for 30 min daily, whereas animals assigned to acute stress groups were exposed once each week. After 7 wk, a dermal punch biopsy was administered to activate the immune response, after which rats were challenged through a forced swim test. Biologic samples were collected to measure corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), oxytocin, testosterone, and the cytokines IL6 and IL10. Rats exposed to chronic stress had lower DHEA:corticosterone ratios, suggesting increased allostatic load. Enrichment exposure modulated these effects, lowering overall corticosterone and testosterone levels and increasing DHEA and oxytocin levels in animals exposed to the predator sound. The immune response was decreased in rats exposed to chronic stress, but the effect of environmental enrichment helped to mitigate the negative influence on cells producing IL6. Combining acute stress and exposure to an enriched environment returned a healthier profile in terms of both immune activation and stress regulation. By using a multidimensional scaling model, we found that a combination of 'good' stress and exposure to brief sessions of enriching stimuli can reliably predict health in Long-Evans rats.

AB  - Maternal separation is a detrimental postnatal influence, whereas environmental enrichment is a therapeutic and protective agent. It is unclear if long-term environmental enrichment can compensate for the effects of maternal separation stress on memory-related alterations. This study examined how environmental enrichment affected memory functions, anxiety level, Grin2a, Grin2b, BDNF, and cFos expressions in the maternally separated rats. There are seven groups in this study: control (C), maternal separation+standard cage (MS), maternal separation + enriched cage (MSE), enriched cage (E), the maternal separation that decapitated at postnatal 21 (MS21) and standard cage that decapitated at PN21 (C21) for hormone and gene expression analysis. The maternal sepa-ration procedure consisted of postnatal 21 days. Learning and memory performance were determined with the Morris water tank test; anxiety and locomotor activity were examined with the open field and elevated plus-maze test. The expression levels of genes were measured by the RT-PCR method. Blood corticosterone level was evaluated by the ELISA method. Results showed that MS increased memory performance, locomotor activity, and anxiety, but it did not change gene expression levels. An enriched environment did not change the memory performance, locomotor activity, and related gene expression levels. MSE group increased their memory per-formance, but the anxiety, locomotor activity, and gene expression level did not change. Grin2a, Grin2b, and BDNF gene expression and corticosterone levels increased in the MS21 group. Maternal separation increased memory performance, but it also increased anxiety. Environmental enrichment alone was insufficient to cause alterations in the memory performance.

AB  - Stress and environmental enrichment have opposing effects on cerebral cellular plasticity. Stress-induced disturbances in neuronal and glial plasticity have been implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. Patients with depression often show volume reductions in specific brain regions. The mechanisms behind these changes are not well understood, but animal studies have indicated that increased levels of glucocorticoids and stress have negative impact on the neuronal and glial cell populations. On the contrary, enriched environment and physical activity have positive effects. In this study we have examined the effect of corticosterone (CORT), environmental enrichment (EE) and running on angiogenesis in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We demonstrate a dramatic inhibition in endothelial cell proliferation in these brain regions in CORT-treated rats. Environmental enrichment had the opposite effect and stimulated endothelial cell proliferation both in the hippocampus and in the PFC. Running had a stimulatory effect in hippocampus, but not in the PFC. We suggest that the angiostatic effect of CORT demonstrated in this study might be paralleled in human subjects exposed to high levels of stress hormones for prolonged periods of time. Raised cortisol levels in depressed or old patients could, by reducing endothelial cell formation/turnover, lead to rarefaction and aging of the vascular bed, and as a result, neuronal function could be impaired. It is tempting to speculate that a physically and intellectually active life may protect against stress-induced vascular changes. Therapeutic agents also targeting the cerebral vasculature could consequently constitute a new tool in the combat of stress-related disorders. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A suitable enriched environment favors development but can also influence behavior and neuronal circuits throughout development. Studies have shown that environmental enrichment (EE) can be used as an essential tool or combined with conventional treatments to improve psychiatric and neurological symptoms, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both disorders affect a significant percentage of the wofrld's population and have complex pathophysiology. Moreover, the available treatments for MDD and ASD are still inadequate for many affected individuals. Experimental models demonstrate that EE has significant positive effects on behavioral modulation. In addition, EE has effects on neurobiology, including improvement in synaptic connections and neuroplasticity, modulation of neurotransmissions, a decrease in inflammation and oxidative stress, and other neurobiology effects that can be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD and ASD. Thus, this review aims to describe the leading behavioral and neurobiological effects associated with EE in MDD and ASD.

AB  - Previous research from our laboratory has shown that exposure to chronic psychosocial stress increased voluntary ethanol consumption and preference as well as acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. This study was done to determine whether an enriched environment could have "curative" effects on chronic psychosocial stress-induced ethanol intake and CPP. For this purpose, experimental mice "intruders" were exposed to the chronic subordinate colony (CSC) housing for 19 consecutive days in the presence of an aggressive "resident" mouse. At the end of that period, mice were tested for their anxiety-like behavior using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test then housed in a standard or enriched environment (SE or EE respectively). Anxiety and ethanol-related behaviors were investigated using the open field (OF) test, a standard two-bottle choice drinking paradigm, and the CPP procedure. As expected, CSC exposure increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced weight gain as compared to single housed colony (SHC) controls. In addition, CSC exposure increased voluntary ethanol intake and ethanol-CPP. Interestingly, we found that EE significantly and consistently reduced anxiety and ethanol consumption and preference. However, neither tastants' (saccharin and quinine) intake nor blood ethanol metabolism were affected by EE. Finally, and most importantly, EE reduced the acquisition of CPP induced by 1.5 g/kg ethanol. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that EE can reduce voluntary ethanol intake and ethanol-induced conditioned reward and seems to be one of the strategies to reduce the behavioral deficits and the risk of anxiety-induced alcohol abuse.

AB  - The effect of social isolation or enriched environment on fear conditioning and extinction was studied in 3.5-4-month-old rats exposed to early proinflammatory stress via LPS administration on the 3rd and 5th day after birth. Social isolation reduced the expression of conditioned fear in males and females, as measured by a decrease in time of the freezing response 24 h post conditioning. The greatest sensitivity to social isolation was observed in rats with early proinflammatory stress, for which the freezing time was reduced after exposure to both the cue and the context. We hypothesize that the decrease in fear is associated with a memory deficit. The enriched environment also reduced the freezing time, but to a lesser extent than social isolation, and only the contextual fear response was reduced. The extinction of fear in males of the LPS group was accelerated after exposure to social isolation and enriched environment compared to animals of this group kept in standard conditions. Exposure to early proinflammatory stress resulted in an increased vulnerability of adult animals to changes in housing conditions.

AB  - Previously results have been shown that chronic methamphetamine causes dependence, withdrawal syndrome and drug craving. Also, environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown protective effects in several animal models of addiction. This study evaluated effect of the EE on the anxiety-depression profile and voluntary METH consumption in METH-dependent rats after abstinence. The rats were chronically treated with bi-daily doses (2 mg/kg, at 12 h intervals) of METH over a period of 14 days. METH dependent rats reared in standard environment (SE) or EE during spontaneous METH withdrawal which lasted 30 days. Then, the rats were tested for anxiety (the elevated plus maze-EPM) and depression (forced swim test-FST) and also voluntary consumption of METH using a two-bottle choice paradigm (TBC). The results showed that the EE rats exhibited an increase in EPM open arm time and entries (P < 0.05), lower levels of immobility (P < 0.001) as compared with the SE groups. Preference ratio of METH was less in the METH/EE rats than the SE group during 2 periods of the intake of drug (P < 0.05). Environmental enrichment seems to be one of the strategies in reduction of behavioral deficits and the risk of relapse induced by METH withdrawal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have previously reported that inhibition of the serotonin transporter (SERT) by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine significantly reduces the number of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)-positive cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We have been interested in exploring whether this SSRI-induced change in TPH might be modified by housing in an enriched environment. Like SSRI antidepressants, environmental enrichment (EE) and physical exercise have been found to have efficacy in the prevention and alleviation of depression. We postulated that EE with exercise and SERT inhibition would similarly affect TPH regulation and that EE with exercise might modify the effect of fluoxetine on TPH. Three week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in either a standard cage (SE) or an enriched environment (EE). SE animals were singly housed with no access to enrichment objects. EE animals were group housed and were provided with various enrichment objects (e.g. running wheel) that were changed and rearranged regularly. Nine weeks after the experiment began, the rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) SE control; (2) SE fluoxetine; (3) EE control; or (4) EE fluoxetine. Fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/day) was placed in the drinking water. Sections of DRN were processed for TPH immunohistochemistry. The number of TPH-positive cells was determined by blinded, manual counting. Results were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey tests. Significance was set at P < 0.05. For animals housed in a standard environment, fluoxetine induced a significant 29% reduction in the number of TPH-immunoreactive cells in the DRN. A similar reduction in TPH immunoreactivity was observed in animals that were housed in an enriched environment but not exposed to fluoxetine (39%). The number of TPH-positive cells in the DRN for animals housed in an enriched environment and exposed to fluoxetine was not significantly different than animals housed in an enriched environment and not exposed to fluoxetine. The reduction of TPH immunoreactivity in the DRN by EE with exercise suggests that a modified housing environment and voluntary exercise affects regulation of TPH, possibly via a mechanism similar to that of SERT inhibitors. This downregulation of serotonin biosynthesis by fluoxetine and EE with exercise may ultimately play a role in the therapeutic action of both interventions. Synapse, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Convincing evidence shows that stress is associated with the development and course of psychiatric and metabolic disorders. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis mediates the stress response, a cascade of events that culminate in the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. Chronic hypercortisolism typically characterizes stress-related illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, and metabolic syndrome. Considering previous studies pointing that environmental enrichment (EE) mitigates the deleterious effects of stress on neurobiological systems, we hypothesized that EE can confer resiliency against prolonged glucocorticoid administration-induced behavioral and metabolic alterations in mice. In this regard, three-month-old male Swiss mice were exposed to a four-week period of standard environment (SE) or EE. After this period, still in the respective environments, dexamethasone was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 4 mg/kg, for 21 consecutive days, in order to generate the emotional-related behavioral outcomes, as previously described. It is demonstrated herein that EE prevents the dexamethasone-induced anxiety-like and passive stress-coping behaviors, as observed in the open field and tail suspension tests. Moreover, EE mitigated the hyperproteinemia and body weight loss induced by excess dexamethasone and decreased basal glucose levels. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that EE attenuates the effects of chronic administration of synthetic glucocorticoids in mice, a strategy that may be translated to the clinical perspective.

AB  - Epileptic patients are at risk of experiencing cognitive deficits as a result of pharmacotherapy as well as etiology of epilepsy. Antiepileptic drugs increase inhibitory neurotransmission and reduce the responsiveness of neurons, and thereby may have a negative impact on memory. The enriched environment intensifies exploration of the new area behavior, which may have a positive impact on spatial memory in rats.
   Depression is among the most common affective disorders in epileptic patients, and using antidepressant drugs together with antiepileptics brings about the risk of interactions and intensifying side effects.
   The aim of the study was to assess the effects of lamotrigine (CAS 84057-84-1, LTG) (10 mg/kg i.p.), a new anticonvulsant with antidepressant and neuroprotective properties, for memory and other behavioral functions in rats in standard and enriched environments (EE). LTG Improved spatial memory upon repeated administration of the drug both in the rats housed in standard conditions and those housed in EE. Exposure to an enriched environment significantly improved spatial learning. LTG showed antidepressant effect on the forced swimming test both in the rats housed in standard conditions and those housed in EE. In rats housed in EE the antidepressant effect occurred earlier. LTG had a low profile of adverse effects (activity meter, chimney test).

AB  - Simple Summary Injurious behavior prevention is a critical issue in the poultry industry due to increasing social stress, leading to negative effects on bird production and survivability, consequently enhancing gut microbiota dysbiosis and neuroinflammation via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Probiotics have been used as potential therapeutic psychobiotics to treat or improve neuropsychiatric disorders or symptoms by boosting cognitive and behavioral processes and reducing stress reactions in humans and various experimental animals. The current data will first report that probiotic Bacillus subtilis reduces stress-induced injurious behavior in laying hens via regulating microbiota-gut-brain function with the potential to be an alternative to beak trimming during poultry egg production. Intestinal microbiota functions such as an endocrine organ to regulate host physiological homeostasis and behavioral exhibition in stress responses via regulating the gut-brain axis in humans and other mammals. In humans, stress-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota leads to intestinal permeability, subsequently affecting the clinical course of neuropsychiatric disorders, increasing the frequency of aggression and related violent behaviors. Probiotics, as direct-fed microorganism, have been used as dietary supplements or functional foods to target gut microbiota (microbiome) for the prevention or therapeutic treatment of mental diseases including social stress-induced psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and schizophrenia. Similar function of the probiotics may present in laying hens due to the intestinal microbiota having a similar function between avian and mammals. In laying hens, some management practices such as hens reared in conventional cages or at a high stocking density may cause stress, leading to injurious behaviors such as aggressive pecking, severe feather pecking, and cannibalism, which is a critical issue facing the poultry industry due to negative effects on hen health and welfare with devastating economic consequences. We discuss the current development of using probiotic Bacillus subtilis to prevent or reduce injurious behavior in laying hens.

AB  - The development of anxiety disorders is often linked to individuals' negative experience. In many animals, development of anxiety-like behavior is modeled by manipulating individuals' exposure to environmental enrichment. We investigated whether environmental enrichment during early ontogenesis affects anxiety-like behavior in larval zebrafish. Larvae were exposed from hatching to either an environment enriched with 3D-objects of different color and shape or to a barren environment. Behavioral testing was conducted at different intervals during development (7, 14, and 21 days post-fertilization, dpf). In a novel object exploration test, 7 dpf larvae of the two treatments displayed similar avoidance of the visual stimulus. However, at 14 and 21 dpf, larvae of the enriched environment showed less avoidance, indicating lower anxiety response. Likewise, larvae of the two treatments demonstrated comparable avoidance of a novel odor stimulus at 7 dpf, with a progressive reduction of anxiety behavior in the enriched treatment with development. In a control experiment, larvae treated before 7 dpf but tested at 14 dpf showed the effect of enrichment on anxiety, suggesting an early determination of the anxiety phenotype. This study confirms a general alteration of zebrafish anxiety-like behavior due to a short enrichment period in first days of life.

AB  - Chronic stress decreases neurogenesis in the adult brain, while exposure to enriched environment (EE) increases it. Recent studies demonstrate the ability of EE to ameliorate stress-induced behavioral deficits. Whether a restored neurogenesis contributes to these effects of EE is unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that EE following restraint stress restores cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG), hippocampal volume and learning. In the current study, we examine the effects of EE following stress on survival and differentiation of the progenitor cells in the DG and behavioral depression using the forced swim test (FST) and sucrose consumption test (SCT). Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by housing in either standard or enriched conditions (10 days, 6 h/day). Survival and differentiation of BrdU-labeled cells were evaluated 31 days post-BrdU administration. Stress decreased the survival and differentiation of progenitor cells, which was ameliorated by EE. Also the percentage of BrdU-ir cells that did not co-localize with NeuN or S100 beta was significantly greater in the stressed rats and was restored by EE. Stress increased immobility in FST and decreased sucrose preference in the SCT, and these behaviors were ameliorated by EE. Adult neurogenesis is thought to be linked to learning and memory and in mediating antidepressant effect. Taken together with our earlier report that EE restores stress-induced impairment in learning and cytogenesis, the Current results indicate that the reversal of adult neurogenesis could be one of the mechanisms involved in the amelioration of stress-induced deficits.

AB  - For decades, the ketogenic diet has been an effective treatment of intractable epilepsy in children. Childhood epilepsy is pharmacoresistant in 25-40 % of patients taking the current prescribed medications. Chronic seizure activity has been linked to deficits in cognitive function and behavioral problems which negatively affect the learning abilities of the child. Recent studies suggest the ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat with low carbohydrate and protein diet, has adverse effects on cognition in weanling rats. The diet reduces circulating glucose levels to where energy metabolism is converted from glycolysis to burning fat and generating ketone bodies which has been suggested as a highly efficient source of energy for the brain. In contrast, when weanling rats are placed in an enriched environment, they exhibit increased spatial learning, memory, and neurogenesis. Thus, this study was done to determine if weanling rats being administered a KD in an environmental enrichment (EE) would still exhibit the negative cognitive effects of the diet previously observed. The present study suggests that an altered environment is capable of reducing the cognitive deficits in weanling rats administered a KD. Learning was improved with an EE. The effect of diet and environment on anxiety and depression suggests a significant reduction in anxiety with enrichment rearing. Interestingly, circulating energy substrate levels were increased in the EE groups along with brain-derived neurotrophic factor despite the least changes in weight gain. In light of numerous studies using KDs that seemingly have adverse effects on cognition, KD-induced reductions in excitotoxic events would not necessarily eliminate that negative aspect of seizures.

AB  - Reptiles are often used as model species in scientific research and are popular in the pet trade, yet how they cope with captive conditions has not been well studied. Stress caused by captivity could affect the endocrinology, physiology and behaviour of animals, resulting in a general decrease in welfare and could confound the results of scientific experiments. One of the factors that could influence stress in a captive environment is the size of the cage. However, the effect of cage size on stress has rarely been investigated in reptiles. In this study, the effect of cage size on the behaviour, morphology and physiology of the green anole (Anolis carolinensis) was quantified. We were unable to find an effect of cage dimensions (range 0.05 to 0.2 m(3)) on body mass, tail-base width, heterophil to lymphocyte ratios (H/L ratios), behaviour and faecal corticosterone metabolite (FCM) levels.

AB  - With the development of laboratory animal science, increasing attention has been given to the possible influence of housing and husbandry on the behaviour and welfare of laboratory animals as well as on the scientific integrity. With the present paper, we aim to contribute to this knowledge by reviewing existing literature on how social factors influence laboratory rodents and non-human primates. We use social ecology in the wild as a starting point to understand experimental studies of these social species. Laboratory studies show that preweaning social experiences, and lack thereof, affect the development of social skills and capacity to cope with stressful situations in both primates and rodents. Studies of deprivation, of preference and of demand indicate that both rodents and primates are highly motivated to interact with conspecifics. When housed alone, rodents and primates typically show a more 'anxious' reaction in behaviour tests, and are more profoundly affected by certain stressors, although there seem to be some differences in how rodent males and females react to different social situations. However, for social housing to be beneficial for the animals, compatible and stable groups are crucial. When forming groups of monkeys in captivity, the age and sex of individuals and their relative age difference, the taxonomic membership of the animals as well as the introductory technique are factors of importance for success. Kinship is also of importance for the compatibility of both rodent and primate groups. Social instability through changes of group composition is apparently stressful, resulting in behavioural and physiological alterations in both rodents and primates. The effects of social conditions around testing have been given much less attention, but several studies show that animals react differently in behaviour tests when tested in group than when tested individually. Altogether, the most commonly used laboratory rodents and primates belong to social species, and their behaviour and welfare are strongly affected by previous and present social environment. Factors such as group composition and stability, rank and previous social experience therefore need to be taken into account both when designing housing systems and when planning experiments and interpreting results.

AB  - Exposure of Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats to an enriched environment (EE) reduced different aspects of operant alcohol self-administration. The present study was aimed at expanding investigation of the effect of EE exposure upon a model of binge drinking composed of daily 1-h drinking sessions with unpredictable access to multiple alcohol concentrations; binge-like alcohol intakes were observed when the drinking session occurred at the last hours of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. Starting from postnatal day (PND) 21, male sP rats were kept under three different housing conditions: impoverished environment (IE; single housing with no environmental enrichment); standard environment (SE; 3 rats/ cage and no environmental enrichment); EE (6 rats/cage and multiple elements of environmental enrichment). From PND 69, rats were exposed daily to a 1-hour drinking session under the 4-bottle "alcohol (10%, 20%, and 30%, v/v) vs. water" choice regimen, during the dark phase, and with timing of alcohol exposure changed each day. In all three rat groups (IE, SE, and EE), alcohol intake increased progressively as the drinking session moved from the first to last hours of the dark phase. The slope of the regression line was steeper in EE than IE and SE rats, suggestive of higher intakes of alcohol in EE than IE and SE rats when the drinking session occurred over the last hours of the dark phase. These results are discussed hypothesizing that the stressful attributes of alcohol expectation were potentiated by the increased "emotionality" that rats living in a comfortable environment (i.e., EE) may experience when facing new, challenging events or environments. Blood alcohol levels, assessed at the end of a final drinking session occurring at the 12th hour of the dark phase, did not differ among the three rat groups and averaged approximately 150 mg%, confirming that this experimental procedure may generate intoxicating levels of alcohol drinking in sP rats.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that stress contributes to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder which is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder and influences over 10% of the world's population. Our previous studies revealed that rats reared in an enriched environment display less depression-related behavior compared to rats raised in an isolated environment, which implies that environmental enrichment produces an antidepressant-like behavioral phenotype. However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Protein phosphorylation rapidly changes signaling pathway function and alters the function of proteins associated with the stress-induced depressive disorder. Thus, in this study, a phosphoproteomic approach was used to uncover differential phosphoprotein regulation in rat nucleus accumbens between isolated (IC) and enriched environmental conditions (EC) under basal conditions, and in response to acute stress. We found 23 phosphoproteins were regulated in EC vs. IC rats under basal conditions; 10 phosphoproteins regulated by stress in IC rats; and 15 regulated by stress in EC rats. Among all significantly regulated phosphoproteins, 11 of them were represented in at least two conditions. The regulated phosphoproteins represent signaling pathway proteins (including ERK2), enzymes, transcriptional regulators, protein translation regulators, transporters, chaperones and cytoskeletal proteins. These findings provide a global view for further understanding the contribution of protein phosphorylation in depression pathogenesis and antidepressant action.

AB  - The fact that hemin can inhibit the mutagenic activity of compounds bearing polycyclic structures is ascribable to the ability of the porphyrin structure to complex with the planar surface of the mutagens. The elucidation of this mechanism has led to the discovery of copper phthalocyanine trisulfonate (cpt) as an efficient ligand to trap polycyclic compounds on polymeric supports that bear cpt through covalent bond linkages. In blue cotton, the support for cpt is cotton, in blue rayon, it is amorphous rayon, and in blue chitin it is poly-N-acetylglucosamine. Using these blue materials, we have successfully isolated mutagens of polycyclic structures, e.g., heterocyclic amines, from environmental complex mixtures such as food, urine, feces, and river water. Preparation and properties of these adsorbents are described. Chlorophyllin linked to Sepharose and chitosan is also described. The use of these green materials is discussed.

AB  - Environmental enrichment in porcine farms improves animal welfare and leads to better public acceptance. To better understand the neurological mechanisms of the response to environmental enrichment, monoaminergic neurotransmitters were quantified in several brain areas from pigs after eight weeks of housing in barren or enriched conditions. Furthermore, iTRAQ labelling combined with LC-MS/MS was used to identify differentially abundant proteins in the hippocampus. Blood biochemical parameters related with stress and welfare were measured. Pigs under enriched conditions showed a decrease in plasma cortisol and lactate. The decrease in noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, a general decrease in the dopaminergic system and an increase of serotonin in the striatum indicate a lower response to stress in enriched conditions. In the proteomic analysis, 2304 proteins were identified, of which 56 were differential between housing groups (46 upregulated and 10 downregulated). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that they were mainly related to ribosome, translation, microtubules and metabolic mitochondrial processes, indicating that pigs under enriched environments have higher abundance of proteins related to protein synthesis and neuronal activity. Together with previous beha-vioural studies, our results suggest that environmental enrichment provides a less stressful environment and that pigs cope better with stress conditions like the slaughterhouse.
   Significance: Animal welfare has become an important aspect for the sustainability of animal production. The modification of the environment by enriching it with rooting materials and wider space allowance is known to have a positive effect on pigs' welfare. Searching for the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, we found that housing in an enriched environment increased the abundance of proteins related to protein synthesis, micro tubule assembly, vesicle-mediated transport and energy metabolism in the hippocampus of pigs. Likewise, changes in the neurotransmitter profile in several brain areas were compatible with a better response to stress. This study expands the knowledge about the biological basis of animal welfare-promoting actions.

AB  - Environmental enrichment attenuates the response to psychostimulants and has been shown to reduce both anxiety and stress-related behaviors. Since stress is a major vulnerability factor for addiction, we investigated whether enrichment could reverse stress profiles in high anxious rats as well as reduce their amphetamine sensitivity. Using selectively-bred high and low anxiety males (filial 3) from enriched, social or isolated environments, we tested elevated plus maze exploration, novelty place preference and amphetamine (AMPH; 0.5 mg/kg, IP)-induced hyperactivity. We measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) response after forced novel object exposure, phosphorylation of the tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor (pTrkB) in the hippocampus and striatum, and dopamine (D2) receptor mRNA levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Results indicate that high anxiety animals reared in social or enriched environments spent more time on open arms of the EPM while low anxiety animals raised in enriched environments spent more time on open arms when compared to either isolated or social groups. There were no group differences or interactions found for novelty place preference. Enriched environments decreased the response to AMPH and stress-induced CORT regardless of trait but selectively decreased pTrkB and increased D2 mRNA levels in high anxiety animals. The results suggest that selectively-bred trait anxiety rats show state anxiety that is influenced by rearing environments, and D2 protein levels and BDNF/TrkB signaling may differentially contribute to integrating these effects.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Anxiety-related disorders and cognitive deficits are common in patients with epilepsy. Previous studies have shown that maternal infection/ immune activation renders children more vulnerable to neurological disorders later in life. Environmental enrichment has been suggested to improve seizures, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in animal models. The present study aimed to explore the effects of environmental enrichment on seizure scores, anxiety-like behavior, and cognitive deficits following maternal immune activation in offspring with epilepsy. Pregnant mice were treated with lipopolysaccharides-(LPS) or vehicle, and offspring were housed in normal or enriched environments during early adolescence to adulthood. To induce epilepsy, adult male and female offspring were treated with Pentylenetetrazol-(PTZ), and then anxiety-like behavior and cognitive functions were assessed. Tumor necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL) 10 were measured in the hippocampus of offspring. Maternal immune activation sex-dependently increased seizure scores in PTZ-treated offspring. Significant increases in anxiety-like behavior, cognitive impairment, and hippocampal TNF-alpha and IL-10 were also found following maternal immune activation in PTZ-treated offspring. However, there was no sex difference in these behavioral abnormalities in offspring. Environmental enrichment reversed the effects of maternal immune activation on behavioral and inflammatory parameters in PTZ-treated offspring. Overall, the present findings highlight the adverse effects of prenatal maternal immune activation on seizure susceptibility and psychiatric comorbidities in offspring. This study suggests that environmental enrichment may be used as a potential treatment approach for behavioral abnormalities following maternal immune activation in PTZ-treated offspring.

AB  - Eckert MJ, Bilkey DK, Abraham WC. Altered plasticity in hippocampal CA1, but not dentate gyrus, following long-term environmental enrichment. J Neurophysiol 103: 3320-3329, 2010. First published April 14, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.01037.2009. Exposure to an enriched environment can improve cognitive functioning in normal animals as well as in animal models of neurological disease and impairment. However, the physiological processes that mediate these changes are poorly understood. Previously we and others have found changes in hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity after 2-4 wk of enrichment although others have not observed effects. To determine whether long-term enrichment produces more robust changes, we housed rats continuously in an enriched environment for a minimum of 3 mo and then tested for effects on hippocampal physiology in vitro and in vivo. Enriched housing improved spatial learning compared with social and isolated housing, but surprisingly this was not accompanied by changes in basal synaptic transmission in either CA1 or the dentate gyrus as measured either in vitro or in vivo. This lack of change may reflect the operation of homeostatic mechanisms that keep global synaptic weights within a narrow range. In tests of synaptic plasticity, the induction of long-term potentiation was not changed in either CA1 or the dentate gyrus. However, in CA1 of enriched rats, there was less long-term depression in stratum radiatum, less depotentiation in stratum oriens, and altered paired-pulse inhibition of population spikes evoked in stratum oriens. These effects suggest that there are altered synaptic and network dynamics in hippocampal CA1 that contribute to the enrichment-related cognitive improvement.

AB  - Our prior research has shown that the transcription of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transcription factors activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and ATF4 are induced by amphetamine and restraint stress in rat striatum. However, presently the full extent of ER stress responses to psychological stress or cocaine, and which of the three ER stress pathways is activated is unknown. The current study examines transcriptional responses of key ER stress target genes subsequent to psychological stress or cocaine. Rats were subjected to acute or repeated restraint stress or cocaine treatment and mRNA was isolated from dorsal striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens brain tissue. ER stress gene mRNA expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNA sequencing. Restraint stress and cocaine-induced transcription of the classic ER stress-induced genes (BIP, CHOP, ATF3 and GADD34) and of two other ER stress components x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and ATF6. In addition, rats living in an enriched environment (large group cage with novel toys changed daily) exhibited rapid induction of GADD34 and ATF3 after 30 min of exploring novel toys, suggesting these genes are also involved in normal non-pathological signaling. However, environmental enrichment, a paradigm that produces protective addiction and depression phenotypes in rats, attenuated the rapid induction of ATF3 and GADD34 after restraint stress. These experiments provide a sensitive measure of ER stress and, more importantly, these results offer good evidence of the activation of ER stress mechanisms from psychological stress, cocaine and natural reward. Thus, ER stress genes may be targets for novel therapeutic targets for depression and addiction. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enrichment of the environment for captive animals is aimed at producing beneficial effects on the behaviour and physiology of relevant species, and is commonly used to reduce harmful social behaviours and stereotypies. However, little work has been undertaken to develop enrichment strategies for fish, in particular those used in regulatory toxicology where strict criteria regarding holding conditions and experimental design can make implementing such techniques problematic. Here, we studied the effect of vertical rod structures, designed to increase environmental complexity and provide refuge, on several commonly cited anxiety-related behaviours and whole-body levels of the stress hormone cortisol in juvenile zebrafish measured over a 1-week period. Activity levels and shoaling density showed no response to tank structures and fish did not spend a significantly greater or lesser amount of time in areas of tanks containing glass rods. Aggression remained high during days 1-5 in tanks containing glass structures before falling to a lower level by day 7. In control tanks, this lower level was reached 2 days earlier, by day 5, suggesting that the glass structures may have slowed the rate of establishment of dominant/subordinate relationships. Overall, whole-body cortisol levels of fish were comparable to those reported in unstressed zebrafish in other studies. Levels were significantly higher in both treatments after 24 h than on subsequent days, most likely due to the handling stress of the initial transfer to experimental tanks. However, cortisol levels did not vary significantly between control and structured tanks at any point during the study. These results indicate that the addition of glass rod structures as hypothesised enrichment did not result in a measurable improvement in welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Housing rodents in an enriched environment (EE) has been typically considered to have positive effects on well-being and cognitive functioning of the animals. However, in some strains of mice, EEs have also been reported to elicit aggression and to promote stress-related outcomes. In the current investigation, we examined whether environmental enrichment would elicit aggression among CD-1 male mice and thus sensitize responses to a subsequent mild stressor. It was first observed that mice housed in an EE for 2 weeks displayed more aggressive behaviors than did mice that had been housed in a standard environment (SE). In the second experiment, it was noted that after 4 weeks of EE or SE housing, mice exhibited comparable plasma corticosterone concentrations as well as levels of brain norepinephrine and its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), in the absence of a challenge. However, upon exposure to mild stressor (placement in a novel cage), relative to their SE counterparts, EE mice were more active and displayed higher plasma corticosterone concentrations and enhanced MHPG accumulation in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. It seems that enrichment in male CD-1 mice promotes aggression, and may sensitize biological processes, possibly increasing vulnerability to stressor-related outcomes.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder with a high impact on the worldwide population. To overcome depression, antidepressant drugs are the first line of treatment. However, pre-clinical studies have pointed out that antidepressants are not entirely efficacious and that the quality of the living environment after stress cessation may play a relevant role in increasing their efficacy. As it is unknown whether a short daily exposure to environmental enrichment during chronic stress and antidepressant treatment will be more effective than just the pharmacological treatment, this study analyzed the effects of fluoxetine, environmental enrichment, and their combination on depressive-associated behavior. Additionally, we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed to chronic mild stress. Our results indicate that fluoxetine reversed anhedonia. Besides, fluoxetine reversed the decrement of some events of the hippocampal neurogenic process caused by chronic mild stress. Conversely, short daily exposure to environmental enrichment changed the deterioration of the coat and anhedonia. Although, this environmental intervention did not produce significant changes in the neurogenic process affected by chronic mild stress, fluoxetine plus environmental enrichment showed similar effects to those caused by environmental enrichment to reverse depressive-like behaviors. Like fluoxetine, the combination reversed the declining number of Ki67, doublecortin, calretinin cells and mature newborn neurons. Finally, this study suggests that short daily exposure to environmental enrichment improves the effects of fluoxetine to reverse the deterioration of the coat and anhedonia in chronically stressed mice. In addition, the combination of fluoxetine with environmental enrichment produces more significant effects than those caused by fluoxetine alone on some events of the neurogenic process. Thus, environmental enrichment improves the benefits of pharmacological treatment by mechanisms that need to be clarified.</p>

AB  - Environmental enrichment may protect against some of the adverse behavioural and biological effects of stressors. However, unlike the effects seen in some species, among male mice housed in groups, enrichment may alter social stability, encourage competition and aggression, and thus promote the establishment of a stressful environment. A potent psychosocial stressor such as social defeat in mice promotes brain neurochemical changes as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine variations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. The present investigation demonstrated that enrichment in group-housed male mice, even in the relatively nonaggressive, although highly anxious BALB/cByJ strain encouraged the effects of a repeated social defeat stressor experienced 4 weeks later, especially with respect to corticosterone as well as hippocampal corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and interleukin (IL)-6 variations. Moreover, within the hippocampus, enrichment itself was accompanied by modest reductions in the expression of the IL-1 beta receptor (IL-1r1). Thus, it seems that living in an enriched environment among group-housed male mice might promote a stressful environment that enhances basal hippocampal CRH and cytokine variations and increased vulnerability to further changes upon subsequent exposure to a social stressor.

AB  - The maternal environment is thought to be important for fetal brain development. However, the effects of maternal environment are not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether enrichment of the maternal environment can influence prenatal brain development and postnatal behaviors in mice. An enriched environment is a housing condition with several objects such as a running wheel, tube and ladder, which are thought to increase sensory, cognitive and motor stimulation in rodents compared with standard housing conditions. First, we measured the number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of fetuses from pregnant dams housed in an enriched environment. Our results revealed that maternal enrichment influences cell proliferation in the hippocampus of female, but not male, fetuses. Second, we used the open-field test to investigate postnatal behaviors in the offspring of dams housed in the enriched environment during pregnancy. We found that maternal enrichment significantly affects the locomotor activity and time spent in the center of the open-field in female, but not male, offspring. These results indicate that maternal enrichment influences prenatal brain development and postnatal behaviors in female offspring. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) that combines voluntary physical exercise, sensory and social stimuli, causes profound changes in rodent brain at molecular, anatomical and behavioral levels. Here, we show that EE efficiently reduces anxiety and depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of depression induced by long-term administration of corticosterone. Mechanisms underlying EE-related beneficial effects remain largely unexplored; however, our results point toward adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted protein, as a main contributor. Indeed, adiponectin-deficient (adipo(-/-)) mice did not benefit from all the EE-induced anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects as evidenced by their differential responses in a series of behavioral tests. Conversely, a single intravenous injection of exogenous adiponectin restored the sensitivity of adipo(-/-) mice to EE-induced behavioral benefits. Interestingly, adiponectin depletion did not prevent the hippocampal neurogenesis induced by EE. Therefore, antidepressant properties of adiponectin are likely to be related to changes in signaling in the hypothalamus rather than through hippocampal-neurogenesis mechanisms. Additionally, EE did not modify the plasma levels of adiponectin but may favor the passage of adiponectin from the blood to the cerebrospinal fluid. Our findings provide advances in the understanding of the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of EE and highlight adiponectin as a pivotal mediator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that emotional state can affect cognitive abilities of humans and non-human animals, determining biases in information processing. Negative mental states, such as anxiety or depression, induce pessimistic judgments of ambiguous stimuli. These assumptions may be used to derive indicators of emotional state in captive animals, providing a novel approach to the assessment of animal welfare. This study used a spatial judgement task, in which farmed pigs were trained to expect food inside a bowl in one location and not in another, to determine whether pigs housed in ways that might be expected to result in relatively positive or negative emotional states respond differently to ambiguous stimuli of intermediate spatial locations. Forty growing pigs were housed in groups of 10 at different density for 8 weeks prior to the start of the test. After training, the pigs successfully discriminated between the rewarded and the unrewarded locations as assessed by increased latency to arrive at the unrewarded location, with no rearing treatment difference. Then, pigs were tested on 3 days in which three ambiguous locations, intermediate between the known rewarded and the unrewarded sites, were introduced and latency recorded. In order to compare the novel cognitive bias task with other welfare indicators, during the 8 weeks of the study four behavioural observations, two measurements of skin lesions, two salivary samples for cortisol and alpha-amylase, and six individual weights to assess growth were collected.
   Considering the mean of the three test days, there was no difference between the treatments in the pigs' judgement of the three ambiguous locations. However, the latency trend during the testing days led to difference between treatments on the third day (P= 0.026). Pigs housed a higher density seemed to learn faster that the ambiguous stimulus near the unrewarded location was also not reinforced by a reward and showed a higher latency to approach on day 3 (44 vs 15.6s). These animals were also observed to have a higher frequency of sitting posture (P= 0.01), and more total skin lesions (P= 0.035) due to aggressiveness, in particular at the ear location (P= 0.009), but did not differ in other physiological parameters.
   Although the results showed no immediate effect of stocking density on cognitive bias, differences in latencies to reach the bowl over the three testing days suggest a different learning process between treatments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prenatal stress can cause many long-term behavior changes in offspring, but whether prenatal stress can alter addictive behavior in offspring and postnatal enriched environment treatment (EE) can restore these changes are unknown. We reported here that prenatal chronic stress (10 unpredictable, 1 s, 0.8 mA foot-shocks per day during gestational days 13-19) enhanced morphine-induced (10 mg/kg, s.c., per day, 6 consecutive days) place preference. Moreover, prenatal chronic stress caused higher depressive-like behavior in forced swimming test in adult offspring. However, enriched environment housing treatment on postnatal days 22-52 counteracted both the abnormal behaviors alterations. This work observed a phenomenon that might contribute to the understanding of clinically important interactions among addiction, prenatal stress and enriched environment treatment. Postnatal enriched environment treatment might be an important therapeutic intervention in preventing the prenatal stress-induced addictive disorders. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exposure of developing rats to noise has shown to induce hippocampal-related behavioral alterations that were prevented after a week of housing in an enriched environment. However, neither the effect of repeated exposures nor its impact on key endogenous antioxidants had been studied yet. Thus, the aim of the present work was to reveal novel data about hippocampal oxidative state through the measurement of possible age-related differences in the levels of hippocampal thioredoxins in rats exposed to noise at different developmental ages and subjected to different schemes and housing conditions. In addition, the possibility that oxidative changes could underlie hippocampal-related behavioral changes was also analyzed. Developing male Wistar rats were exposed to noise for 2 h, either once or for 5 days. Upon weaning, some animals were transferred to an enriched cage for 1 week, whereas others were kept in standard cages. One week later, auditory and behavioral assessments, as well as measurement of hippocampal thioredoxin, were performed. Whereas no changes in the auditory function were observed, significant behavioral differences were found, that varied according to the age, scheme of exposure and housing condition. In addition, a significant increase in Trx-1 levels was found in all noise-exposed groups housed in standard cages. Housing animals in an enriched environment for 1 week was effective in preventing most of these changes. These findings suggest that animals become less susceptible to undergo behavioral alterations after repeated exposure to an environmental challenge, probably due to the ability of adaptation to an unfavorable condition. Moreover, it could be hypothesized that damage to younger individuals could be more easily prevented by a housing manipulation.

AB  - Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. It is commonly treated with psychostimulants that typically begins during childhood and lasts for an extended period of time. However, there are concerns regarding the consequences of chronic psychostimulant treatment; thus, there is a growing search for an alternative management for ADHD. One non -pharmacological management that is gaining much interest is environmental enrichment. Here, we investigated the effects of rearing in an enriched environment (EE) on the expression of ADHD-like symptoms in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs), an animal model of ADHD. SHRs were reared in EE or standard environment (SE) from post-natal day (PND) 21 until PND 49. Thereafter, behavioral tests that measure hyperactivity (open field test [OM), inattention (Y-maze task), and impulsivity (delay discounting task) were conducted. Additionally, electroencephalography (EEG) was employed to assess the effects of EE on rat's brain activity. Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, the normotensive counterpart of the SHRs, were used to determine whether the effects of EE were specific to a particular genetic background. EE improved the performance of the SHRs and WKY rats in the OFT and Y-maze task, but not the delay discounting task. Interestingly, EE induced significant EEG changes in WKY rats, but not in the SHRs. These findings show that rearing environment may play a role in the expression of ADHD-like symptoms in the SHRs and that EE may be considered as a putative complementary approach in managing ADHD symptoms.

AB  - Adult, virgin rats do not spontaneously display maternal behavior when exposed to foster pups. However, continuous daily exposure of the female to foster pups for about 5-7 days can induce a set of maternal behaviors similar to those shown by postpartum dams. Induction latencies depend upon a number of factors, including the stress and anxiety levels of the female. The goal of this study was to attempt to mitigate the likely stressfulness of being singly housed during testing by enriching the rat's home cage environment and to determine if the concomitant environmental change would alter the latency to express maternal behavior. In addition, the effect of varying the number of test pups used for testing was examined. Two groups of virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were first tested on the elevated plus maze after 1 week of exposure to either control (standard housing) or enriched conditions. One week later, maternal behavior testing began using one or three pups. Upon completion of maternal behavior testing, plasma corticosterone concentrations were determined following a mild stressor. The data indicate that enrichment tends to increase anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze. In addition, enrichment delayed the onset of maternal behavior irrespective of the number of test pups. There were no effects of environmental enrichment on plasma corticosterone levels following exposure to a stressor. These results indicate that what is considered a modestly enriched environment delays the expression of pup-oriented responses and does not apparently reduce stress or improve performance on all behavioral tasks.

AB  - Moderate levels of anxiety enable individual animals to cope with stressors through avoidance, and could be an adaptive trait. However, repeated stress exacerbates anxiety to pathologically high levels. Dendritic remodeling in the basolateral amygdala is proposed to mediate potentiation of anxiety after stress. Similarly, modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor is thought to be important for the behavioral effects of stress. In the present study, we investigate if relatively short periods of environmental enrichment in adulthood can confer resilience against stress-induced anxiety and concomitant changes in neuronal arborisation and brain derived neurotrophic factor within basolateral amygdala. Two weeks of environmental enrichment countermanded the propensity of increased anxiety following chronic immobilization stress. Environmental enrichment concurrently reduced dendritic branching and spine density of projection neurons of the basolateral amygdala. Moreover, stress increased abundance of BDNF mRNA in the basolateral amygdala in agreement with the dendritic hypertrophy post-stress and role of BDNF in promoting dendritic arborisation. In contrast, environmental enrichment prevented stress-induced rise in the BDNF mRNA abundance. Gain in body weights and adrenal weights remained unaffected by exposure to environmental enrichment. These observations suggest that a short period of environmental enrichment can provide resilience against maladaptive effects of stress on hormonal, neuronal and molecular mediators of anxiogenesis.

AB  - Rationale During the last few decades, alcohol use disorders (AUD) have reached an epidemic prevalence, yet social influences on alcoholism have not been fully addressed. Several factors can modulate alcohol intake. On one hand, stress can reinforce ethanol-induced behaviors and be an important component in AUD and alcoholism. On the other hand, environmental enrichment (EE) has a neuroprotective role and prevents the development of excessive ethanol intake in rodents. However, studies showing the role of EE in chronic psychosocial stress-impaired ethanol-conditioned rewards are nonexistent. Aim The purpose of the current study is to explore the potential protective role of EE on extinction and reinstatement of ethanol-conditioned place preference (EtOH-CPP) following chronic psychosocial stress. Methods In the first experiment and after the EtOH-CPP test, the mice were subjected to 15 days of chronic stress, then housed in a standard (SE) or enriched environment (EE) while EtOH-CPP extinction was achieved by repeated exposure to the CPP chambers without ethanol injection. In the second experiment and after the EtOH-CPP test, extinction was achieved as described above. Mice were then exposed to chronic stress for 2 weeks before being housed in a SE or EE. EtOH-CPP reinstatement was induced by a single exposure to the conditioning chambers. Results As expected, stress exposure increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced weight gain. More importantly, we found that EE significantly shortened chronic stress-delayed extinction and decreased the reinstatement of EtOH-CPP. Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that EE reduces the impact of alcohol-associated environmental stimuli, and hence it may be a general intervention for reducing cue-elicited craving and relapse in humans.

AB  - Enriched environments are beneficial to neurobiological development; specifically, rodents exposed to complex, rather than standard laboratory, environments exhibit evidence of neuroplasticity and enhanced cognitive performance. In the present study, the nature of elements placed in the complex environment was investigated. Accordingly, rats (n=8 per group) were housed either in a natural environment characterised by stimuli such as dirt and rocks, an artificial environment characterised by plastic toys and synthetic nesting materials, a natural/artificial environment characterised by a combination of artificial and natural stimuli or a laboratory standard environment characterised by no enrichment stimuli. Following exposure to emotional and cognitive behavioural tasks, including a cricket hunting task, a novel object preference task and a forced swim task, brains were processed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-, neuronal nuclei (NeuN)- and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunoreactivity. Baseline and stress foecal samples were collected to assess corticosterone (CORT) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Natural environment animals exhibited shorter diving latencies and increased diving frequencies in the second forced swimming task, along with higher DHEA/CORT ratios, and higher GFAP immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. The type of environmental enrichment did not influence levels of BDNF immunoreactivity in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; however, natural environment animals exhibited higher levels of NeuN immunoreactivity in the retrosplenial cortex, an area involved in spatial memory and other cognitive functions. These results suggest that, in addition to enhancing behavioural and endocrinological variables associated with resilience, exposure to natural stimuli might alter plasticity in brain areas associated with cortical processing and learning.

AB  - In this study we examine whether exposure to differential housing after weaning would counteract the effects of postnatal handling (H) or nonhandling (NH) treatment by affecting learning and memory processes in young rats. In addition, we seek to determine if experience in enriched environment would alter hippocampal nerve growth factor (NGF) levels which is one of the factors known to be involved in the regulation of the survival and differentiation of developing basal forebrain neurones. Rats were either exposed to handling treatment, or left undisturbed starting day 1 after birth through day 21. After weaning on day 22, we exposed half of the H rats and half of the NH rats to environmental enrichment for 60 days. The other respective half of the rats was housed in isolated environmental condition (IC). Behavioural measures were taken in open field test, and spatial water maze test. Exposure to enriched environment following postnatal handling and nonhandling increased hippocampal NGF levels, and improved cognitive function in the both groups, with NH rats being more responsive to the effects of enrichment. Our results suggest that environmental enrichment has the potential to prevent or reduce the cognitive and neurochemical deficits in the adult animals associated with nonhandling.

AB  - Roman high- and low-avoidance (RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh) rats are selected and bred for extreme divergence in two-way active avoidance acquisition. In addition, compared to RLA/Verh rats, RHA/Verh rats are (behaviorally and physiologically) less anxious or reactive to stressors, show increased novelty (sensation)-seeking behavior as well as a higher preference for rewarding substances, and are usually less efficient in learning tasks not involving shock administration. The present article reviews evidence showing that neonatal handling and/or environmental enrichment leads to enduring effects (their magnitude frequently depending upon the rat line) on those behaviors. For example, it has been found that neonatal handling reduces most of the (behavioral and physiological) signs of emotionality/anxiety in RLA/Verh rats, while environmental enrichment increases their novelty seeking (also the case with RHA/Verh rats), saccharin and ethanol intake, and sensitivity to amphetamine. Finally, initial results (currently being further elaborated upon) support a preventive action of both environmental treatments on age-related impairments in learning a spatial, water maze task as well as on hippocampal neuronal atrophy.

AB  - Background: The amygdala is crucial for emotional cognitive processing. Affective or emotional states can bias cognitive processes, including attention, memory, and decision-making. This can result in optimistic or pessimistic behaviors that are partially driven by the activation of the amygdala. The resulting emotional cognitive bias is a common feature of anxiety and mood disorders, both of which are interactively influenced by genetic and environmental factors. It is also known that emotional cognitive biases can be influenced by environmental factors. However, little is known about the effects of genetics and/or gene-environment interactions on emotional cognitive biases. We investigated the effects of the genetic background and environmental enrichment on the transcriptional profiles of the mouse amygdala following a well-established cognitive bias test.Methods: Twenty-four female C57BL/6J and B6D2F1N mice were housed either in standard (control) conditions or in an enriched environment. After appropriate training, the cognitive bias test was performed on 19 mice that satisfactorily completed the training scheme to assess their responses to ambiguous cues. This allowed us to calculate an "optimism score" for each mouse. Subsequently, we dissected the anterior and posterior portions of the amygdala to perform RNA-sequencing for differential expression and other statistical analyses.Results: In general, we found only minor changes in the amygdala's transcriptome associated with the levels of optimism in our mice. In contrast, we observed wide molecular effects of the genetic background in both housing environments. The C57BL/6J animals showed more transcriptional changes in response to enriched environments than the B6D2F1N mice. We also generally found more dysregulated genes in the posterior than in the anterior portion of the amygdala. Gene set overrepresentation analyses consistently implicated cellular metabolic responses and immune processes in the differences observed between mouse strains, while processes favoring neurogenesis and neurotransmission were implicated in the responses to environmental enrichment. In a correlation analysis, lipid metabolism in the anterior amygdala was suggested to influence the levels of optimism.Conclusions: Our observations underscore the importance of selecting appropriate animal models when performing molecular studies of affective conditions or emotional states, and suggest an important role of immune and stress responses in the genetic component of emotion regulation.

AB  - Maternal defense behavior (or maternal aggression) is a highly conserved behavior for protecting offspring that is normally associated with decreased fear and anxiety in rodent dams. Environmental enrichment can decrease indices of fearfulness and anxiety (and elevate novelty seeking) in laboratory animals. This study examined whether enrichment could alter levels of maternal aggression and elevated plus maze performance in lactating mice. One group of female mice was exposed to a series of novel objects for 1.5 months while the other group was not. As expected, mice that had been exposed to an enriched environment showed significantly more entries to and time on the open arms of an elevated plus maze while they were lactating. Enriched mice showed similar maze performances when tested 3 months later in a non-lactating state, even though enrichment had been removed for 3 months. Further, offspring of enriched dams exhibited maze performance similar to that of their dams, suggesting possible epigenetic influences on maze performance. in, contrast, no differences in measures of maternal aggression or pup retrieval were detected between enriched and control lactating mice. Together, these results indicate that environmental enrichment has long lasting effects on plus maze performance, but does not alter maternal aggression. The findings also suggest that whatever neural pathways are altered by enrichment do not strongly overlap or. regulate those governing maternal aggression. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the effect of environmental enrichment during morphine dependency and withdrawal on the severity of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs, anxiety, and depressive-like behaviors and voluntary morphine consumption in morphine-dependent rats. The rats were injected with bi-daily doses (10mg/kg, 12h intervals) of morphine for 14 days following rearing in a standard environment (SE) or enriched environment (EE) during the development of morphine dependence and withdrawal. Then, rats were tested for withdrawal signs after naloxone injection, anxiety (the elevated plus maze) and depression-related behavior (sucrose preference test), and voluntary consumption of morphine using a two-bottle choice paradigm, in morphine-dependent and morphine-withdrawn rats. The results showed that EE decreased naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs, but not anxiety or sucrose preference during dependence on morphine. The EE-withdrawn rats showed an increase in the elevated plus maze open arm time and entries and higher levels of sucrose preference than SE rats. Voluntary consumption of morphine was lower in the EE-withdrawn rats than in the SE groups in the second period of drug intake. Thus, exposure to EE reduced the severity of morphine dependence and voluntary consumption of morphine, alongside reductions in anxiety and depression-related behavior in morphine-withdrawn rats.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) development is a very complex process that can be altered by environmental stimuli such as noise, which can generate long-term auditory and/or extra-auditory impairments. We have previously reported that early noise exposure can induce hippocampus-related behavioral alterations in postnatal day (PND) 28 adolescent rats. Furthermore, we recently found biochemical modifications in the hippocampus (HC) of these animals that seemed to endure even in more mature animals (i.e. PND35) and that have not been studied along with behavioral correlates. Thus, the aim of this work was to reveal novel data about the effects of early noise exposure on hippocampal-dependent behaviors in more mature animals. Additionally, extended enriched environment (EE) housing was evaluated to determine its capacity to induce behavioral modifications, either by its neuroprotective ability or the greater stimulation that it generates. Male Wistar rats were exposed to different noise schemes at PND7 or PND15. Upon weaning, some animals were transferred to EE whereas others were kept in standard cages. At PND35, different hippocampal-dependent behavioral assessments were performed. Results showed noise-induced behavioral changes that differed according to the scheme and age of exposure used. In addition, housing in an EE was effective either in preventing some of these changes or in inducing the appearance of new behavioral modifications. These findings suggest that CNS development would be sensitive to the effects of different type of environmental stimuli such as noise or enriched housing, leading to maladaptive behavioral changes that last even until adolescence.

AB  - Environmental Enrichment (EE) improves cognitive function and enhances brain plasticity, while chronic stress increases emotionality, impairs learning and memory, and has adverse effects on brain anatomy and biochem-istry. We explored the beneficial role of environmental enrichment initiated in adolescence against the negative outcomes of Chronic Unpredictable Stress (CUS) during adulthood on emotional behavior, cognitive function, as well as somatic and neuroendocrine markers in both sexes. Adolescent Wistar rats housed either in enriched or standard housing conditions for 10 weeks. On postnatal day 66, a subgroup from each housing condition was daily exposed to a 4-week stress protocol. Following stress, adult rats underwent behavioral testing to evaluate anxiety, exploration/locomotor activity, depressive-like behavior and spatial learning/memory. Upon comple-tion of behavioral testing, animals were exposed to a 10-m stressful event to test the neuroendocrine response to acute stress. CUS decreased body weight gain and increased adrenal weight. Some stress-induced behavioral adverse effects were sex-specific since learning impairments were limited to males while depressive-like behavior to females. EE housing protected against CUS-related behavioral deficits and body weight loss. Exposure to CUS affected the neuroendocrine response of males to acute stress as revealed by the increased corticosterone levels. Our findings highlight the significant role of EE in adolescence as a protective factor against the negative effects of stress and underline the importance of inclusion of both sexes in animal studies.

AB  - Prenatal stress can result in various behavior deficits in offspring. Here we tested the effects of environmental enrichment during gestation used as a preventive strategy on the behavior deficits of prenatal-p stressed offspring rats as well as the underlying structure basis. We compared the effect size of environmental enrichment during gestation on prenatal-stressed offspring to that of environmental enrichment after weaning. Our results showed that environmental enrichment during gestation partially prevented anxiety and the damage in learning and memory in prenatal-stressed offspring as evaluated by elevated plus-maze test and Morris water maze test. At the same time, environmental enrichment during gestation inhibited the decrease in spine density of CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons and preserved the expression of synaptophysin and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus of prenatal-stressed offspring. There was no significant difference in offspring behavior between 7-day environmental enrichment during gestation and 14-day offspring environmental enrichment after weaning. These data suggest that environmental enrichment during gestation effectively prevented the behavior deficits and the abnormal synapse structures in prenatal-stressed offspring, and that it can be used as an efficient preventive strategy against prenatal stresses.

AB  - Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that early-life stress (ELS) may lead to the development of mental disorders in adulthood. Maternal separation (MS) is a valid animal model of ELS that produces detrimental effects on brain and behavior of experimental animals. Positive environmental stimuli have been shown to counteract the behavioral deficits of ELS and enhance neuroplasticity. Recent data indicate that music may serve as a form of environmental enrichment in experimental animals. However, the underlying mechanisms through which musical enrichment exerts its effects are poorly understood. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to a 3 h MS protocol during postnatal days (PND) 2-14, while another group was left undisturbed. Half of the animals within each group were exposed from PND 21 to PND 76 for 12 h/day to Mozart K. 448. At approximately three months of age, elevated plus maze procedure, forced swim test and social approach task were applied to test whether music exposure can mitigate the effects of MS stress on animal emotional behaviors. Moreover, we investigated the effects of these treatments on dendritic spine density in the CA1 region of hippocampus. As expected, MS rats showed decreased sociability, increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and decreased mature dendritic spines in the CA1 region of hippocampus in adulthood. Musical enrichment reversed these effects. Our results suggest that musical enrichment can reverse the negative effects of MS on anxiety, depression, and sociability in adult rats and modulate neuronal plasticity and provide additional data for a new therapeutic intervention to rescue emotional symptoms.

AB  - Preclinical studies have clearly indicated that offspring of mothers who suffered sleep deprivation during pregnancy exhibit anxiety, depression-like behaviors, and cognitive deficits. The cognitive impairment induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) is currently poorly treated. Growing evidence indicates that an enriched environment (EE) improves cognition function in models of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and lipopolysaccharide. However, the effects of EE on hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as synaptic plasticity markers changes induced by MSD, are unclear. In the present study, pregnant CD-1 mice were randomly divided into a control group, MSD group, and MSD+EE group. Two different living environments, including standard environment and EE, were prepared. When male and female offspring were 2 months, the open field test and elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behavior, and the Morris water maze was used to evaluate hippocampal learning and memory. Western blotting and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in the hippocampus of offspring. The results revealed that MSD-induced offspring showed anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, while EE alleviated anxiety-like behavior and cognitive impairment in offspring of the MSD+EE group. The cognitive impairment induced by MSD was associated with a decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an increased Synaptotagmin-1, while EE increased and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in the hippocampus of mice from the MSD+EE group, respectively. Taken together, we can conclude that EE has beneficial effects on MSD-induced synaptic plasticity markers changes and can alleviate anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment.

AB  - Post-exposing the rats to enriched environment has shown to attenuate the psychoneurological and behavioral deficits produced as a result of chronic stress in rats. But here we studied the possibility whether the pre-exposure of enriched environment might affect the behavioral deficits produced as a post-treatment to chronic restraint stress. Behavioral parameters, associated with chronic stress such as depression, anxiety and memory were monitored before and after stress treatment, in socially enriched and socially non-enriched conditions. According to the results the rats that were pre-exposed to socially enriched conditions indicated an anti-depressive and anxiolytic activity after repeated stress procedure as compared to the rats of socially non-enriched environment. Furthermore, improvement and retention of short term and long term memory was observed in enriched rats before and after restraint stress procedure. This study can be related to the beneficial role of earlier exposure to enriched environment that may affect the behaviors related to response of brain to stress stimuli and prevention of behavioral deficits that may lead to various psychological abnormalities that are related to prolonged stress exposures.

AB  - A great deal of studies show that many factors such as noise, light, presence of human beings can disturb the physiology and the behaviour of animal that are housed and manipuled in laboratory, in modifying their welfare state. According to some authors, to house animals in an enriched environment increases their ability to adapt to the environment and lowers their level of stress and emotion in new situations.
   The aim of the study here presented and carried out in the animal house of the Sanofi-Synthelabo centre is to determine the influence of the reproduction of dawn and dusk as well as the presence of temporary music in the housing room on the rat's behaviour at various moments said to be stressful for it. The results show that the enriched environment decreases the rat's reactivity in housing rooms but has only little influence when rats are taken out to be manipulated and has no influence on the results obtained during an anxiety test (Elevated Plus-Maze).

AB  - Social defeat in mice is a potent stressor that promotes the development of depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours, as well as variations of neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter activity. Although environmental enrichment may protect against some of the adverse behavioural and biological effects of social defeat, it seems that, among male group-housed mice maintained in an enriched environment (EE), aggressive behaviours may be more readily instigated, thus promoting distress and exacerbating psychopathological features. Thus, although an EE can potentially have numerous beneficial effects, these may depend on the general conditions in which mice were raised. It was observed in the current investigations that EE group-housed BALB/cByJ mice displayed increased anxiety-like behaviours compared to their counterparts maintained in a standard environment (SE). Furthermore, in response to social defeat, EE group-housed male mice exhibited decreased weight gain, exaggerated corticosterone elevations and altered hippocampal norepinephrine utilization compared to their SE counterparts. These effects were not apparent in the individually housed EE mice and, in fact, enrichment among these mice appeared to buffer against serotonin changes induced by social defeat. It is possible that some potentially beneficial effects of enrichment were precluded among group-housed mice, possibly owing to social disturbances that might occur in these conditions. In fact, even if social interaction is an essential feature of enrichment, it seems that some of the positive effects of this housing condition might be optimal when mice are housed individually, particularly with regard to buffering the effects of social defeat.

AB  - Environmental factors seem to play a key role in brain and behavioral development, both in humans and animals. Different environmental manipulations, either pre- or post-natal, have been shown to exert long-term physiological and behavioral effects. While studies in the field of Enriched Environment mainly focus on the post weaning period and provide enrichment as a post adverse-experience manipulation, the preceding effects of prenatal Enriched Environment have rarely been investigated. In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal Enriched Environment (through the entire pregnancy) followed by adulthood acute stress. In the prenatal Enriched Environment offspring, we found anxiety and depressive-like behaviors with poor attentional performance. Surprisingly, when prenatal Enriched Environment was followed by adulthood stress, we observed a dramatic restoration of these behavioral deficits. Our results suggest that prenatal Enriched Environment may substrate resiliency to adulthood stress. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - When individuals are exposed to stressful environmental challenges, the response varies widely in one or more of three components: psychology, behavior and physiology. This variability among individuals can be defined as temperament. In recent years, an increasing large body of evidence suggests that the dimensions of temperament, as well as personality, psychological disorders and behavioral traits, are influenced by genetic factors, and much of the variation appears to involve variation in genes or gene polymorphisms in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the behavior-controlling neurotransmitter networks. Here, we review our current understanding of the probabilistic impact of a number of candidate gene polymorphisms that control temperament, psychological disorders and behavioral traits in animals and human, including the gene polymorphisms related to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) production and adrenal cortisol production involved in the HPA axis, and a large number of gene polymorphisms in the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter networks. It will very likely to assist in diagnosis and treatment of human relevant disorders, and provide useful contributions to our understanding of evolution, welfare and conservation, for animals in the wild and in production systems. Additionally, investigations of gene-gene and gene-environment complex interactions in humans and animals need further clear illustration.

AB  - Stressful events during gestation can have sex-specific effects on brain and behaviour, and may contribute to some of the differences observed in adult stress responding and psychopathology. We investigated the impact of a novel repeated prenatal psychological stress (prenatal predator exposure PPS) during the last week of gestation in rats on offspring behaviours related to social interaction (play behaviour), open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SP) during the juvenile period and in adulthood. We further examined the role of postnatal environmental, using an enhanced housing condition (EHC), to prevent/rescue any changes. Some effects on anxiety, anhedonia, and stress-related coping behaviours (e.g., OFT, SP and OFT) did not emerge until adulthood. PPS increased OFT anxiety behaviours in adult males, and some OFT and SP behaviours in adult females. Contrary to this, EHC had few independent effects; most were apparent only when combined with PPS. In keeping with age-group differences, juvenile behaviours did not necessarily predict the same adult behaviours although juvenile OFT rearing and freezing, and juvenile FST immobility did predict adult FST immobility and sucrose preference, suggesting that some aspects of depressive behaviours may emerge early and predict adult vulnerability or coping behaviours. Together, these results suggest an important, though complex, role for early life psychological stressors and early life behaviours in creating an adult vulnerability to anxiety or depressive disorders and that environmental factors further modulate the effects of the prenatal stressors.

AB  - The behavioral, biochemical, and physiologic consequences of 6 wk of environmental enrichment were evaluated in male Long Evans and Sprague Dawley rats and compared with those of rats in standard single-housing conditions. Standard housing provided little or no social or physical stimulation whereas environmental enrichment comprised group housing for 8 h daily in a 3-story cage equipped with novel stimuli. Dependent measures included performance in the forced swim test, thresholds for brain-stimulation reward, sucrose intake and preference, determination of corticosterone levels before and after brief restraint stress, and rate of weight gain. In forced swimming tests, active behaviors (diving, swimming with struggling, and climbing) tended to dominate over passive behaviors (sinking, floating) in both groups and outbred rat stocks (especially in enriched groups) on the first day. These behaviors were replaced with maintenance behaviors such as grooming and swimming without struggling on the second exposure, with enriched Long Evans rats showing the largest decline in activity. Baseline plasma corticosterone levels were elevated in both rat stocks after 6 wk of enrichment. After restraint stress, hormone levels in enriched animals tended to peak earlier and approach or exceed baseline values more quickly than was observed in the comparable control groups. Rate of body weight gain was greater in enriched Long Evans rats than Sprague Dawley or control rats. Our observations indicate that stock-and group-associated differences in several indices occur in association with enrichment. The data support the claim that environmental enrichment may render animals more resilient to challenges.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is widely used as a promising translational model organism for studying various brain disorders. Zebrafish are also commonly used in behavioral and drug screening assays utilizing individually tested (socially isolated) fish. Various sounds represent important exogenous factors that may affect fish behavior. Mounting evidence shows that musical/auditory environmental enrichment can improve welfare of laboratory animals, including fishes. Here, we show that auditory environmental enrichment mitigates anxiogenic-like effects caused by acute 24-h social isolation in adult zebrafish. Thus, auditory environmental enrichment may offer an inexpensive, feasible and simple tool to improve welfare of zebrafish stocks in laboratory facilities, reduce unwanted procedural stress, lower non-specific behavioral variance and, hence, collectively improve zebrafish data reliability and reproducibility.

AB  - The social environment is a major determinant of individual stress response and lifetime health. The present study shows that (1) social enrichment has a significant impact on neuroplasticity and behaviour particularly in females; and (2) social enrichment in females can be transmitted to their unexposed female descendants. Two generations (F0 and F1) of male and female rats raised in standard and social housing conditions were examined for neurohormonal and molecular alterations along with changes in four behavioural modalities. In addition to higher cortical neuronal density and cortical thickness, social experience in mothers reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in F0 rats and their F1 non-social housing offspring. Only F0 social mothers and their F1 non-social daughters displayed improved novelty-seeking exploratory behaviour and reduced anxiety-related behaviour whereas their motor and cognitive performance remained unchanged. Also, cortical and mRNA measurements in the F1 generation were affected by social experience intergenerationally via the female lineage (mother-to-daughter). These findings indicate that social experience promotes cortical neuroplasticity, neurohormonal and behavioural outcomes, and these changes can be transmitted to the F1 non-social offspring in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, a socially stimulating environment may form new biobehavioural phenotypes not only in exposed individuals, but also in their intergenerationally programmed descendants.

AB  - Prenatal morphine exposure throughout pregnancy can induce a series of neurobehavioral and neurochemical disturbances by affecting central nervous system development. This study was designed to investigate the effects of an enriched environment on behavioral deficits and changes in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels induced by prenatal morphine in rats. On pregnancy days 11-18, female Wistar rats were randomly injected twice daily with saline or morphine. Offspring were weaned on postnatal day (PND) 21. They were subjected to a standard rearing environment or an enriched environment on PNDs 22-50. On PNDs 51-57, the behavioral responses including anxiety and depression-like behaviors, and passive avoidance memory as well as hippocampal BDNF levels were investigated. The light/dark (L/D) box and elevated plus maze (EPM) were used for the study of anxiety, forced swimming test (FST) was used to assess depression-like behavior and passive avoidance task was used to evaluate learning and memory. Prenatal morphine exposure caused a reduction in time spent in the EPM open arms and a reduction in time spent in the lit side of the L/D box. It also decreased step-through latency and increased time spent in the dark side of passive avoidance task. Prenatal morphine exposure also reduced immobility time and increased swimming time in FST. Postnatal rearing in an enriched environment counteracted with behavioral deficits in the EPM and passive avoidance task, but not in the L/D box. This suggests that exposure to an enriched environment during adolescence period alters anxiety profile in a task-specific manner. Prenatal morphine exposure reduced hippocampal BDNF levels, but enriched environment significantly increased BDNF levels in both saline-and morphine-exposed groups. Our results demonstrate that exposure to an enriched environment alleviates behavioral deficits induced by prenatal morphine exposure and up-regulates the decreased levels of BDNF. BDNF may contribute to the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on prenatal morphine-exposed to rats. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anhedonia, or the inability to experience positive feelings is a hallmark of depression. However, few animal models have relied on decreased positive affect as an index of susceptibility to depression. Rats emit frequency-modulated ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), designated as "positive" calls in the 50-kHz range. USVs have been associated with pharmacological activation of motivational reward circuits. Here we utilized selectively-bred rats differing in "emotionality" to ask whether there are associated differences in USVs. Rats bred based on locomotor response to novelty and classified as bred High Responders (bHRs) or bred Low Responders (bLRs) exhibit inborn differences in response to environmental cues, stress responsiveness, and depression-like behavior. These animals also exhibit differences in anxiety-like behavior, which are reversed by exposure to environmental complexity (EC). Finally, these animals exhibit unique profiles of responsiveness to rewarding stimuli accompanied with distinct patterns of dopamine regulation. We investigated whether acute and chronic environmental manipulations impacted USVs in bHRs and bLRs. We found that, relative to bLRs, bHRs emitted significantly more 50-kHz USVs. However, if a bLR is accompanied by another bLR, there is a significant increase in 50-kHZ USVs emitted by this phenotype. bHRs emitted increases in 50-kHZ UVSs upon first exposure to EC, whereas bLRs showed a similar increase only after repeated exposure. bLRs' increase in positive affect after chronic EC was coupled with significant positive correlations between corticosterone levels and c-fos mRNA in the accumbens. Conversely, a decline in the rate of positive calls in bHRs after chronic EC was associated with a negative correlation between corticosterone and accumbens c-fos mRNA. These studies demonstrate that inborn differences in emotionality interact with the environment to influence positive affect and underscore the potential interaction between glucocorticoids and the mesolimbic reward circuitry in modulating 50-kHz calls.

AB  - Objective: The present study was intended to assess the effect of environmental enrichment on the diabetes as well as combined actions of diabetes and stress on the neurons of the motor cortex of rat brain.
   Background: Untreated diabetes mellitus causes severe insults to the neurons of the central nervous system. Treatment with environmental enrichment is known for producing significant and reliable neuronal changes in the neurological disorders of central nervous system.
   Materials and methods: Mare albino rats of Wistar strain, aged 35 days were used. The rats were divided into (A) Normal Control (B) Vehicle Control (C) Diabetic (D) Diabetes+Stress (E)Diabetes+Environmental enrichment (F)Diabetes+Stress+Environmental enrichment (n=6) in each group). Blood glucose levels and body weight was measured before the induction of diabetes, on the 2nd day after induction of diabetes and before sacrifice. After exposure to stress and environmental enrichment diabetic rats were sacrificed (Day 30) and brains were processed for cresyl violet staining. The number of survived neurons in the motor cortex was quantified.
   Results: Quantification of cresyl violet neurons in the motor cortex showed a significant increase in the number of survived neurons in Diabetes+Environmental enrichment and Diabetes+Stress+Environmental enrichment group rats compared to Diabetes and Diabetes+Stress group rats respectively.
   Conclusion: Findings from the present study indicated that the exposure to environmental enrichment can prevent the amount of the neural damage caused by complications of diabetes and combined actions of diabetes and stress to the neurons of the motor cortex (Fig. 5, Ref. 37).

AB  - The presence of a conspecific during a stressful situation, i.e. social support, can considerably lower the stress response of an individual compared to experiencing the stressful situation alone. Pigs also benefit from social support, but it is not known whether the extent to which they benefit is dependent on their personality or coping style. In this study, therefore, the effect of social support on behavioral and physiological (i.e. salivary cortisol, heart rate and the heart rate variability parameters standard deviation (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD)) stress responses was studied in pigs with different coping styles. Based on the backtest, piglets were classified as high-resisting (HR) or low-resisting (LR). At 11 weeks of age, 12 gilts of each coping style were subjected to a 15 min restraint test in a weighing cage without a pen mate present (i.e. no support treatment) and 12 other gilts of each coping style were subjected to this test with a pen mate, a boar with the same coping style, present (i.e. support treatment). With the pen mate present, LR gilts showed less standing alert behavior and they had their ears back less often than without the pen mate present. On the other hand, HR gilts seemed to spend less time on escaping the cage and more HR gilts seemed to urinate in the situation when the pen mate was present than without the pen mate present, but this was not significant. Independently of the test situation, HR gilts grunted more than LR gilts and they were more likely to urinate than LR gilts. Salivary cortisol concentrations were not affected by treatment or coping style, but were increased at 30 min after the start of the test after which concentrations decreased again to starting levels. The heart rate and heart rate variability parameters RMSSD and RMSSD/SDNN ratio were not affected by treatment or coping style, but the SDNN was lower in the LR pigs during the first and last 5 min of the test when a pen mate was present than without the pen mate present. In addition, heart rate and heart rate variability were increased during the test compared to before and after the test No differences in behavior and salivary cortisol concentrations were found between the HR and LR accompanying boars. Although effects of social support were not found on all variables measured, the results do indicate that pigs may benefit from social support during a stressful situation and that pigs with a low-resisting coping style will likely benefit more than pigs with a high-resisting coping style.

AB  - The mammalian brain has evolved in close synchrony with the natural environment; consequently, trends toward disengagement from natural environments in today's industrialized societies may compromise adaptive neural responses and lead to psychiatric illness. Investigations of rodents housed in enriched environments indicate enhanced neurobiological complexity; yet, the origin of these stimuli, natural vs. manufactured, has not been sufficiently explored. In the current study, groups of rats were exposed to one of three environments: (1) a standard environment with only food and water, (2) an artificial-enriched environment with manufactured stimuli and (3) a natural-enriched environment with natural stimuli. Results indicated that, during the dark phase, natural-enriched animals exhibited longer durations interacting with objects than the artificial-enriched group; further, the natural-enriched group engaged in more social behavior than the other two groups. Both enriched groups exhibited less anxiety in response to a novel object but the natural-enriched rats exhibited less anxiety-typical behavior in response to a predator odor than the other groups. Less fos activation in the amygdala was observed in both enriched groups following a water escape task whereas an increase in fos activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed in the natural-enriched animals. Thus, the current findings indicate the potential importance of exposure to complex environments, especially naturallike habitats, in the maintenance of emotional health, perhaps providing a buffer against the emergence of anxiogenic responses.

In this work, we demonstrate that exposure to environmental enrichment (EE) prevented stress-induced increases in anxiety (emerging 10 days post-stress) in adult rats without blocking stress-induced dendritic branch remodeling in the BLA nor stress-induced enhancement of GC serum levels.

AB  - Early life environment affect the normal development of the mood in the process of infant development and increase the risk of mental disorder diseases. The aim of current study was to investigate enriched environment can repair emotional deficits in offspring rats induced by maternal chronic stress during pregnancy, explore the molecular mechanisms from the changes of monoamine neurotransmitters, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) in the hippocampus. A rat model of maternal chronic stress during pregnancy was mating from 3rd day during subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Offsprings were weaned on day 21 and housed under either standard or enriched environment 30 days. Plasmacorticosterone levels of maternal rats and their offspring were determined by radioimmunoassay. The body weights were recorded in PND 21 and PND 50. Emotional responses were tested using open-field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT) and tail of suspend test (TST). The levels of DA, NE and 5-HT in hippocampus of all experimental animals were detected using enzyme-linked immunoassay kit. Results indicated that an elevation was observed in the plasma corticosterone level of rat model of maternal chronic stress during pregnancy. Enriched environment treatment reduced offspring's plasma corticosterone level and improved their body weight, changed the emotional function, increased the level of hippocampal NE, DA and 5-HT in OPS group. Collectively, these findings disclose that increasing of hippocampal monoamine neurotransmitters and decreasing of corticosterone in offspring after enriched environment might be the possible cause for emotional dysfunction induced by maternal chronic stress rat during pregnancy.

AB  - Physical-cognitive activity has long-lasting beneficial effects on the brain and on behavior. Environmental enrichment (EE) induces brain activity known to influence the behavior of mice, as measured in learned helplessness paradigms (forced swim test), and neurogenic cell populations in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. However, it is not completely clear whether the antidepressant and proneurogenic effects of EE are different in animals that are naive or pre-exposed to the stress inducing helplessness, and if this depends on the type of stressor. It also remains unclear whether differential effects are exerted on distinct neurogenic subpopulations. We found that EE has a protective effect in adult female mice (C57BL/6J) when exposed twice to the same stressor (forced swim test) but it has no influence on recovery. The repeated exposure to this stressor was analyzed together with the effects of EE on different neurogenic populations distinguished by age and differentiation state, Younger cells are more sensitive and responsive to the conditions, both the positive and negative effects. These results are relevant to identify the cell populations that are the targets of stress, depression, and enrichment, and that form part of the mechanism responsible for mood dysfunctions.

AB  - The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a membrane-associated protein expressed in neurons and glia at mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs). S1R interacts with different partners to regulate cellular responses, including ER stress, mitochondrial physiology and Ca2+ fluxes. S1R shapes cellular plasticity by directly modulating signaling pathways involved in inflammatory responses, cell survival and death. We here analyzed its impact on brain plasticity in vivo, in mice trained in a complex maze, the Hamlet test. The device, providing strong enriched environment (EE) conditions, mimics a small village. It has a central agora and streets expanding from it, leading to functionalized houses where animals can Drink, Eat, Hide, Run, or Interact. Animals were trained in groups, 4 h/day for two weeks, and their maze exploration and topographic memory could be analyzed. Several groups of mice were considered: non-trained vs. trained; repeatedly administered with saline vs. NE-100, a selective S1R antagonist; and wildtype vs. S1R KO mice. S1R inactivation altered maze exploration and prevented topographic learning. EE induced a strong plasticity measured through resilience to behavioral despair or to the amnesic effects of scopolamine, and increases in S1R expression and bdnf mRNA levels in the hippocampus; increases in neurogenesis (proliferation and maturation); and increases of histone acetylation in the hippocampus and cortex. S1R inactivation altered all these parameters significantly, showing that S1R activity plays a major role in physiological brain plasticity. As S1R is a major resident protein in MAMs, modulating ER responses and mitochondrial homeostasy, MAM physiology appeared impacted by enriched environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Even when freshly isolated tissues are used, they are almost always derived from animals housed in cages that poorly reflect the animal's native environment. This issue is highlighted by studies on brain function, where mice housed in a more natural "enriched environment" display enhanced learning and memory and delayed onset of symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases compared to mice housed conventionally. How the environment mediates its effects on brain function is poorly understood.
   Results: We show that after exposure of adolescent mice to an "enriched environment," the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity that is thought to contribute to learning and memory, involves a novel signal transduction pathway that is nonfunctional in comparable mice housed conventionally. This environmentally gated signaling pathway, which rescues defective LTP induction in adolescent RasGRF knockout mice, consists of NMDA glutamate receptor activation of p38, a MAP kinase that does not contribute to LTP in mice housed conventionally. Interestingly, the same exposure to environmental enrichment does not have this effect in adult mice.
   Conclusions: This study reveals a new level of cell signaling control whereby environmental factors gate the efficacy of a specific signaling cascade to control how LTP is induced in adolescent animals. The suppression of this gating mechanism in mature animals represents a new form of age-dependent decline in brain plasticity.

AB  - Understanding environmental influences on individuals' behaviour is challenging. Here we have investigated the housing impact of 9 weeks of enriched environment (EE) and social isolation (SI) and the impact of abrupt deprivation of EE (enrichment removal: ER) on BALB/c mice. Compared with the widely used C57BL/6 strain in research, BALB/c synthesises serotonin less efficiently due to a genetic variation and thus may potentially represent human populations at higher risk of stress-related disorders. We assessed the effects of EE and SI by conducting a behavioural test battery and the effects of acute ER by monitoring homecage activities and social behaviour. We found that EE and SI impact BALB/c's physiological states and behavioural performances from lower to higher cognitive processes: increased body weight, increased rectal temperature, altered performance in motor and sensory tasks, the activity level in a novel environment and altered performance in tests of anxiety-like behaviour, stress-coping strategies and learning and memory. Furthermore, acute ER triggered stress/frustration-like behaviour in BALB/c, with increased aggression, increased social distancing and disrupted daily/nightly activities. Our results demonstrate that long-lasting housing manipulation such as EE and SI, impact behaviour via multilayered processes over a wide range of functional domains, and unforeseen change to a negative environment, ER, is a major stressor that causes behavioural and psychological consequences through environment-gene interactions, a model of direct relevance to human health.

AB  - Perinatal asphyxia during delivery produces long-term disability and represents a major problem in neonatal and pediatric care. Numerous neuroprotective approaches have been described to decrease the effects of perinatal asphyxia. Enriched environment is a popular strategy to counteract nervous system injuries. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether enriched environment is able to decrease the asphyxia-induced neurobehavioral developmental delay in neonatal rats. Asphyxia was induced in ready-to-deliver mothers by removing the pups by caesarian section after 15 min of asphyxia. Somatic and neurobehavioral development was tested daily and motor coordination weekly. Our results show that rats undergoing perinatal asphyxia had a marked developmental delay and worse performance in motor coordination tests. However, pups kept in enriched environment showed a decrease in the developmental delay observed in control asphyctic pups. Rats growing up in enriched environment did not show decrease in weight gain after the first week and the delay in reflex appearance was not as marked as in control rats. In addition, the development of motor coordination was not as strikingly delayed as in the control group. Short-term neurofunctional outcome are known to correlate with long-term deficits. Our results thus show that enriched environment could be a powerful strategy to decrease the deleterious developmental effects of perinatal asphyxia.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a technique that may reduce the stress of nonhuman animals in captivity. Stress may interfere with normal behavioral expression and affect cognitive decision making. Noninvasive hormonal studies can provide important information about the stress statuses of animals. This study evaluated the effectiveness of different environmental enrichment treatments in the diminution of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (stress indicators) of three captive maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus). Correlations of the fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels with expressed behaviors were also determined. Results showed that environmental enrichment reduced fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels. Furthermore, interspecific and foraging enrichment items were most effective in reducing stress in two of the three wolves. No definite pattern was found between behavioral and physiological responses to stress. In conclusion, these behavioral and physiological data showed that maned wolves responded positively from an animal well being perspective to the enrichment items presented.

AB  - Social stressors produce neurobiological and emotional consequences in social species. Environmental interventions, such as environmental enrichment and exercise, may modulate physiological and behavioral stress responses. The present study investigated the benefits of environmental enrichment and exercise against social stress in the socially monogamous prairie vole. Female prairie voles remained paired with a sibling (control) or were isolated from a sibling for 4 weeks. The isolated groups were assigned to isolated sedentary, isolated with environmental enrichment, or isolated with both enrichment and exercise conditions. Behaviors related to depression, anxiety, and sociality were investigated using the forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze (EPM), and a social crowding stressor (SCS), respectively. cFos expression was evaluated in stress-related circuitry following the SCS. Both enrichment and enrichment with exercise protected against depression-relevant behaviors in the FST and social behavioral disruptions in the SCS, but only enrichment with exercise protected against anxiety-related behaviors in the EPM and altered cFos expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in isolated prairie voles. Enrichment may improve emotion-related and social behaviors, however physical exercise may be an important component of environmental strategies for protecting against anxiety-related behaviors and reducing neural activation as a function of social stress.

AB  - Introduction: The absence epilepsies are presumed to be caused by genetic factors, but the influence of environmental exposures on epilepsy development and severity, and whether this influence is transmitted to subsequent generations, is not well known. We assessed the effects of environmental enrichment on epilepsy and anxiety outcomes in multiple generations of GAERS a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy that manifests co-morbid elevated anxiety-like behaviour.
   Methods: GAERS were exposed to environmental enrichment or standard housing beginning either prior to, or after epilepsy onset, and underwent EEG recordings and anxiety testing. Then, we exposed male GAERS to early enrichment or standard housing and generated F1 progeny, which also underwent EEG recordings. Hippocampal CRH mRNA expression and DNA methylation were assessed using RT-PCR and pyrosequencing, respectively.
   Results: Early environmental enrichment delayed the onset of epilepsy in GAERS, and resulted in fewer seizures in adulthood, compared with standard housed GAERS. Enrichment also reduced the frequency of seizures when initiated in adulthood. Anxiety levels were reduced by enrichment, and these anti-epileptogenic and anxiolytic effects were heritable into the next generation. We also found reduced expression of CRH mRNA in GAERS exposed to enrichment, but this was not due to changes in DNA methylation.
   Conclusions: Environmental enrichment produces disease-modifying effects on genetically determined absence epilepsy and anxiety, and these beneficial effects are transferable to the subsequent generation. Reduced CRH expression was associated with these phenotypic improvements. Environmental stimulation holds promise as a naturalistic therapy for genetically determined epilepsy which may benefit subsequent generations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diazepam is one of the widely prescribed sedative drugs for the treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders. However, its continuous use can induce addiction, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms and, therefore, the pharmacological use of diazepam is restricted. Exposure to enriched environment can reduce the addiction to stimulants including amphetamine, cocaine, and nicotine. However, the protective effect of enriched environment against preference of sedative drugs is not yet investigated. This study, therefore, determined the effects of enriched environment to prevent diazepam-preference using conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Adult rats were reared in social (n = 12) or physically (n = 12) enriched environment for four weeks. Each group was then sub-divided into two groups and were administered either saline (Control; n = 6) or diazepam (1 mg/kg; n = 6) on alternate days for thirteen days. During the administration of diazepam, the CPP was conducted to monitor drug preference on 5th, 9th and 13th day of experiment. It was observed that the diazepam administration significantly (p <.01) induced preference in rats. Neurobehavioral deficits including hypolocomotor activity, depression-like behavior, impaired learning and memory functions were also observed after 24 h of drug abstinence. Exposure to enriched environment significantly reduced diazepam-preference and other neurobehavioral deficits. This study provides preliminary evidence to highlight the importance of enriched environment in the attenuation of diazepam-preference.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is discussed to play a role in specific subgroups of different psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders. We have previously shown that a mouse model of trait anxiety (HAB) displays enhanced microglial density and phagocytic activity in key regions of anxiety circuits compared to normal-anxiety controls (NAB). Using minocycline, we provided causal evidence that reducing microglial activation within the dentate gyrus (DG) attenuated enhanced anxiety in HABs. Besides pharmacological intervention, "positive environmental stimuli", which have the advantage of exerting no side-effects, have been shown to modulate inflammation-related markers in human beings. Therefore, we now investigated whether environmental enrichment (EE) would be sufficient to modulate upregulated neuroinflammation in high-anxiety HABs. We show for the first time that EE can indeed attenuate enhanced trait anxiety, even when presented as late as adulthood. We further found that EE-induced anxiolysis was associated with the attenuation of enhanced microglial density (using Iba-1 as the marker) in the DG and medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, EE reduced Iba1 + CD68+ microglia density within the anterior DG. Hence, the successful attenuation of trait anxiety by EE was associated in part with the normalization of neuro-inflammatory imbalances. These results suggest that pharmacological and/or positive behavioral therapies triggering microglia-targeted anti-inflammatory effects could be promising as novel alternatives or complimentary anxiolytic therapeutic approaches in specific subgroups of individuals predisposed to trait anxiety.

AB  - There is ample evidence that physical activity exerts positive effects on a variety of brain functions by facilitating neuroprotective processes and influencing neuroplasticity. Accordingly, numerous studies have shown that continuous exercise can successfully diminish or prevent the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease in transgenic mouse models. However, the long-term effect of physical activity on brain health of aging wild-type (WT) mice has not yet been studied in detail. Here, we show that prolonged physical and cognitive stimulation, mediated by an enriched environment (FE) paradigm for a duration of 11 months, leads to reduced anxiety and improved spatial reference memory in C57BL6 WT mice. While the number of CA1 pyramidal neurons remained unchanged between standard housed (SH) and EE mice, the number of dentate gyrus (DG) neurons, as well as the CA1 and DG volume were significantly increased in FE mice. A whole-brain deep sequencing transcriptome analysis, carried out to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects, revealed an up-regulation of a variety of genes upon EE, mainly associated with synaptic plasticity and transcription regulation. The present findings corroborate the impact of continuous physical activity as a potential prospective route in the prevention of age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Rodents are highly dependent on maternal care after birth. Maternal separation (MS) is an animal model for studying neglect and abuse. Depriving the pup of such care renders the animal with Hypothalamic-Pituitary-adrenal (HPA) dysfunction and these animals are more susceptible to anxiety and stress as well as poor cognition. These effects are due to abnormal brain development in these animals. We have tried to investigate how maternal separation can affect pain sensation and whether a non-pharmacological intervention such as enriched environment (EE) can restore an abnormal pain sensation. Animals were put into four groups MS, control (CTRL) and MS + EE and CTRL + EE groups that underwent EE after weaning until adulthood. These groups were tested for pain sensitivity with hot plate and tail flick for sensory pain and formalin for affect pain. The results showed that MS rats are more sensitive to pain in the hot plate test and formalin test, however, no significant difference was seen between groups for tail flick test. When MS rats experience EE their pain sensitivity is restored at the behavioral level. Further research is required to see how EE restores pain sensation in MS rats.

AB  - Several different interventions improve depressed mood, including medication and environmental factors such as regular physical exercise. The molecular pathways underlying these effects are still not fully understood. In this study, we sought to identify shared mechanisms underlying antidepressant interventions. We studied three groups of mice: mice treated with a widely used antidepressant drug - fluoxetine, mice engaged in voluntary exercise, and mice living in an enriched environment. The hippocampi of treated mice were investigated at the molecular and cellular levels. Mice treated with fluoxetine and mice who exercised daily showed, not only similar antidepressant behavior, but also similar changes in gene expression and hippocampal neurons. These changes were not observed in mice with environmental enrichment. An increase in neurogenesis and dendritic spine density was observed following four weeks of fluoxetine treatment and voluntary exercise. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed four different modules of co-expressed genes that were correlated with the antidepressant effect. This network analysis enabled us to identify genes involved in the molecular pathways underlying the effects of fluoxetine and exercise. The existence of both neuronal and gene expression changes common to antidepressant drug and exercise suggests a shared mechanism underlying their effect. Further studies of these findings may be used to uncover the molecular mechanisms of depression, and to identify new avenues of therapy.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) increases levels of novelty and complexity, inducing enhanced sensory, cognitive and motor stimulation. In wild-type rodents, EE has been found to have a range of effects, such as enhancing experience-dependent cellular plasticity and cognitive performance, relative to standard-housed controls. Whilst environmental enrichment is of course a relative term, dependent on the nature of control environmental conditions, epidemiological studies suggest that EE has direct clinical relevance to a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. EE has been demonstrated to induce beneficial effects in animal models of a wide variety of brain disorders. The first evidence of beneficial effects of EE in a genetically targeted animal model was generated using Huntington's disease transgenic mice. Subsequent studies found that EE was also therapeutic in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, consistent with epidemiological studies of relevant environmental modifiers. EE has also been found to ameliorate behavioural, cellular and molecular deficits in animal models of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, depression, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. This review will focus on the effects of EE observed in animal models of neurodegenerative brain diseases, at molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. The proposal that EE may act synergistically with other approaches, such as drug and cell therapies, to facilitate brain repair will be discussed. I will also discuss the therapeutic potential of enviromimetics', drugs which mimic or enhance the therapeutic effects of cognitive activity and physical exercise, for both neuroprotection and brain repair.

AB  - Rationale and objectives: Heroin addiction is a significant health and societal problem for which there is no highly effective long-term behavioral or pharmacological treatment. Therefore, strategies that support heroin abstinence should be a primary focus of heroin treatment research. To this end, the current study used an animal conflict model that captures the aversive consequences of drug seeking (as are typical in humans, e.g., incarceration and job loss) to induce abstinence. Using this abstinence model, we examined the capacity of environmental enrichment (EE) to facilitate abstinence in heroin seeldng rats.
   Methods: The procedure consisted of two phases: drug self-administration (phase 1) and electric barrier application (phase 2) that resulted in abstinence. For phase 1, male rats were trained to self-administer intravenous heroin under a fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement. After self-administration was acquired, animals were housed either in EE or standard cages (non-EE control). During abstinence in phase 2, the electric barrier was introduced in the operant conditioning chambers by electrifying the floor area near the levers.
   Results: We found that EE rats achieved abstinence (zero active lever presses for 3 consecutive sessions) in significantly fewer sessions than NEE rats. Further, EE rats abstained at significantly lower electric currents than NEE rats.
   Conclusions: EE facilitated abstinence in the conflict model. The current use of the abstinence-conflict model to investigate EE as a behavioral strategy to facilitate abstinence will help in the development of effective treatments for humartaddicts by bringing together the positive consequences of abstinent behavior in an enriched environment with the aversive consequences of drug seeking.

AB  - Despite intense research efforts, biologists are still puzzled by the existence of animal personality. While recent studies support a link between cognition and personality, the directionality of this relationship still needs to be clarified. Early-life experiences can affect adult behaviour, and among these, cognitive stimulation has been suggested theoretically to influence personality. Yet, the influence of early cognitive stimulation has rarely been explored in empirical investigations of animal behaviour and personality. We investigated the effect of early cognitive stimulation on adult personality in the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). To this end, we assessed adult behaviour across a number of personality assays and compared behaviour of individuals previously exposed to a series of learning tasks as chicks, with that of control individuals lacking this experience. We found that individuals exposed to early stimulation were, as adults, more vigilant and performed fewer escape attempts in personality assays. Other behaviours describing personality traits in the fowl were not affected. We conclude that our results support the hypothesis that early stimulation can affect aspects of adult behaviour and personality, suggesting a hitherto underappreciated causality link between cognition and personality. Future research should aim to confirm these findings and resolve their underlying dynamics and proximate mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Along with being the main target of many antidepressant medications, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is known to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders. In line with this, mice with varying 5-HTT genotypes are invaluable tools to study depression- and anxiety-like behaviours as well as the mechanisms mediating potential therapeutics. There is clear evidence that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the aetiology of psychiatric disorders. In that regard, housing paradigms which seek to enhance cognitive stimulation and physical activity have been shown to exert beneficial effects in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, we examined the effects of environmental enrichment on affective-like behaviours and sensorimotor gating function of 5-HTT knock-out (KO) mice. Using the elevated plus maze and the light-dark box, we found that environmental enrichment ameliorated the abnormal innate anxiety of 5-HTT KO mice on both tests. In contrast, environmental enrichment did not rescue the depression like behaviour displayed by 5-HTT KO mice in the forced-swim test. Finally, measuring pre-pulse inhibition, we found no effect of genotype or treatment on sensorimotor gating. In conclusion, our data suggest that environmental enrichment specifically reduces innate anxiety of 5-HTT KO mice with no amelioration of the depression-like behaviour. This has implications for the current use of clinical interventions for patients with symptoms of both anxiety and depression.

AB  - Deficits of cognitive functions are perceived as an important pathogenic factor of many neurological and psychiatric diseases. Such symptoms can be a result of a disease process or appear due to applied medication. Epilepsy is a disease in which cognitive deficits can occur before first seizures, during seizures and remissions. Valproic acid (VAL, CAS 77372-61-3) is a medicine applied in order to control epileptic seizures and mood stabilizing in bipolar disorders and mania. Its activity is related to the effect on neurotransmission of many systems.
   The present study was conducted to investigate whether enriched environment (EE) conditions affect learning and memory, and influence the antidepressant effect in rats.
   VAL improves spatial memory upon repeated administration both in the rats housed in standard conditions (SC) (after 21 days of treatment) and those housed in enriched environment (as early as after 14 days of treatment). VAL has an antidepressant effect on the forced swimming test both in the rats housed in standard conditions and those housed in EE. In rats housed in EE, the antidepressant effect occurred much earlier (as early as after 7 days of VAL administration). It is worth noting that VAL has a low profile of adverse effects (Activity Meter, chimney test). The correlations observed may be translated into clinical effects, leading to new, more effective VAL therapies in depression or memory disorders in patients with underlying epilepsy.

AB  - In the current review a role of social isolation in development of anxious and depressive-like behavior in rodents is described. There was shown an involvement of several factors in the effects of social isolation such as duration of isolation, age, sex, animal line characteristics, the behavioral model, and type of the equipment used, etc. The molecular-cellular mechanisms of development of the anxious and depressive-like behavior under the influence of social isolation and a role in these mechanisms of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, oxidative and nitrosative stress, neuro-inflammation, BDNF, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and monoamines are considered. The data about sex differences in the effects of social isolation, an interaction with other types of stress and a role of the enriched environment and other factors in buffering the negative consequences of social isolation are also discussed in the paper.

AB  - Early social isolation (SI) produces a variety of emotional, behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. Conversely, environmental enrichment (EE), a complicated social and physical construct, offers beneficial effects on brain plasticity and development. However, whether or not exclusive physical EE is sufficient to reverse the adverse consequences of early SI remains unclear. Here we reported that 1 month-old solitary mice housed in the EE for 8 weeks corrected spatial cognitive dysfunction, but did not ameliorate social interaction deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior. Pathological analyses revealed that the enriched environment decreased cellular apoptosis, synaptic protein loss, myelination defect and microglial activation in the hippocampus, but not medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice housed singly. Moreover, increased nuclear factor-kappaB and interleukin-1 beta levels, and downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway were normalized in the hippocampus rather than mPFC of these animals. Our results revealed a brain region-specific effectiveness of physical EE in remediating brain impairment of adolescent SI mice, with a complete reversal of hippocampus-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, but without mitigation of mPFC associated anxiety and social interaction defects. This finding emphasizes the irreplaceable role of social life for the early brain development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exposure to prolonged stress results in structural and functional alterations in the hippocampus including reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), neurogenesis, spatial learning and working memory impairments, and enhanced anxiety-like behavior. On the other hand, enriched environment (EE) has beneficial effects on hippocampal structure and function, such as improved memory, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, and progressive synaptic plasticity. It is unclear whether exposure to short-term EE for 10 days can overcome restraint stress-induced cognitive deficits and impaired hippocampal plasticity. Consequently, the present study explored the beneficial effects of short-term EE on chronic stress-induced impaired LTP, working memory, and anxiety-like behavior. Male Wistar rats were subjected to chronic restraint stress (6hr/day) over a period of 21 days, and then they were exposed to EE (6hr/day) for 10 days. Restraint stress reduced hippocampal CA1-LTP, increased anxiety-like symptoms in elevated plus maze, and impaired working memory in T-maze task. Remarkably, EE facilitated hippocampal LTP, improved working memory performance, and completely overcame the effect of chronic stress on anxiety behavior. In conclusion, exposure to EE can bring out positive effects on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and thereby elicit its beneficial effects on cognitive functions.

AB  - Rationale: Early-life stressful experiences are associated to alterations in behavioural responses and development of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. In rodents, individual housing is considered as a stressful condition whilst enriched environment can protect against stress and its negative consequences. Neuroendocrine responses to stress can also be altered by early-life experiences and seem to contribute to behavioural alterations induced by changes in housing conditions.
   Objective: To develop an improved procedure of social isolation throughout development (from pre-adolescence to adulthood) in CD1 mice and to elucidate its effects. on behavioural parameters related to stress and neuroendocrine responses compared to enriched or social conditions.
   Materials and methods: CD1 male mice (PND 21) were housed in social/standard conditions, enriched conditions or isolated conditions during seven weeks. After that, different relevant behaviours were evaluated, including locomotor activity, anxiety-like and despair behaviour. Levels of plasma corticosterone were also analysed before and after a stressful event.
   Results: CD1 mice exposed to an isolated environment exhibited higher locomotion and anxiety-like responses than animals exposed to social or enriched conditions. In addition, isolated animals showed lower basal plasma corticosterone than social or enriched ones but after a stressful event the elevation of plasma corticosterone was higher, suggesting an enhanced response of the HPA axis to a novel and stressful situation.
   Conclusions: Social interaction is an important feature to display an appropriate behavioural and neuronal development. Habituation to novel stimuli is impaired in subjects exposed to social isolation and induces increased excitability response to stressful events. Social deprivation increases the possibility of altered neuronal function and could facilitate the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A suboptimal housing environment such as small cage size can adversely influence many aspects of the biology of laboratory animals including their response in behavioral tests. However, the effect of cage size on the mental and physical conditions of Kunming mice, which have been widely used to develop models of depression, anxiety, and many other diseases in China, are still far from clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cage size on reproductive ability, exploratory behavior, anxiety, and working memory of Kunming mice. Two cage sizes were used, including a standard cage (20 x 30 x 25 cm(3)) and a restricted cage (10 x 20 x 25 cm(3)). The results revealed that compared with mice in the standard cages, mice in the restricted cages showed: (I) a decreased delivery rate of dams (P < 0.05) and a lower survival rate of offspring (P < 0.05), specifically in females (P < 0.05); (II) a decreased exploratory behavior (P < 0.01) and an increased anxiety level (P < 0.01); and (III) higher working memory in the T-maze test (P < 0.05). These results indicated that a restricted cage size has detrimental effects on the reproductive ability and anxiety level, but its effect on cognitive ability is complex and warrants further study. In short, these results provide empirical evidence for better practices in caring for Kunming mice, with some cautions about the effects of cage size on behavioral tests.

AB  - Parasitism and other stressors are ubiquitous in nature but their effects on animal behaviour can be difficult to identify. We investigated the effects of nematode parasitism and other indicators of physiological impairment on the sequential complexity of foraging and locomotion behaviour among wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui). We observed all sexually mature individuals (n = 28) in one macaque study group between October 2007 and August 2008, and collected two faecal samples/month/individual (n = 362) for parasitological examination. We used detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to investigate long-range autocorrelation in separate, binary sequences of foraging (n = 459) and locomotion (n = 446) behaviour collected via focal sampling. All behavioural sequences exhibited long-range autocorrelation, and linear mixed-effects models suggest that increasing infection with the nodular worm Oesophagostomum aculeatum, clinically impaired health, reproductive activity, ageing and low dominance status were associated with reductions in the complexity of locomotion, and to a lesser extent foraging, behaviour. Furthermore, the sequential complexity of behaviour increased with environmental complexity. We argue that a reduction in complexity in animal behaviour characterizes individuals in impaired or 'stressed' states, and may have consequences if animals cannot cope with heterogeneity in their natural habitats.

AB  - Several interventions have been shown to counteract the effects of stress that may be related to improved neuroplasticity and neuronal activation. In this sense, environmental enrichment (ENR) protects against acute stress and increases neuroplasticity. It has been suggested that the use of patterned auditory stimuli (PAS) may be beneficial in increasing the effectiveness of ENR on disorders related to stress, such as depression and anxiety. Examples of PAS are classical music compositions that have interesting effects at both clinical and preclinical levels. Thus, we analyzed the effects of the exposure to PAS, represented in this study by Mozart's compositions, during ENR housing for 35 days in adult male Balb/C mice to evaluate depression-associated behavior using the forced-swim test (FST) paradigm with an additional short exposure to PAS. We found that the ENR mice that were exposed to PAS during both housing and behavioral task (ENR + PAS/FST + PAS) show decreased immobility and the number of despair episodes within a higher latency to show the first bout of immobility. Additionally, we found increased neuronal activation evaluated by the identification of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein-(Arc-) labeled cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice exposed to PAS during housing and in the absence or presence of PAS during FST. Moreover, we found increased neuronal activation in the auditory cortex (AuCx) of mice exposed to PAS during FST. Our study suggests that the exposure to PAS during an emotional challenge decreases despair-like behavior in rodents that were previously housed in an enriched environment in combination with auditory stimuli. Thus, our data indicate that the role of the exposure to PAS as an intervention or in combination with positive environment to aid in treating neuropsychiatric disorders is worth pursuing.

AB  - Background
   The behavior of animals is modified by captivity. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a program designed to enhance the welfare of confined animals by providing them with a more stimulating background. This is carried out by the implementation of a series of activities that encourages them to present behaviors typical of their species, as well as keeps them active. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the influence of the EE in the behavioral variables in a colony of 24 stumptail macaques (Macaca arctoides). Our hypothesis is that the application of this program will reduce aggression, stereotypes and coprophilia behaviors and, at the same time, will increase exploration and solitary play.
   Methods
   The behavioral frequency previous to EE was compared with that during EE implementation.
   Results
   Our results showed that aggression, coprophilia stereotypic behaviors and social play were significantly reduced during EE, whereas exploration was significantly enhanced. The response of the individuals according to gender was similar for both sexes.
   Conclusions
   Environmental enrichment programs are indispensable for captive animals' wellbeing as they reduce aggression and stress while providing animals both physical and cognitive entertainment.

AB  - Relapse remains the most prominent hurdle to successful rehabilitation from alcoholism. The neural mechanisms underlying relapse are complex, but our understanding of the brain regions involved, the anatomical circuitry and the modulation of specific nuclei in the context of stress and cue-induced relapse have improved significantly in recent years. In particular, stress is now recognised as a significant trigger for relapse, adding to the well-established impact of chronic stress to escalate alcohol consumption. It is therefore unsurprising that the stress-responsive regions of the brain have also been implicated in alcohol relapse, such as the nucleus accumbens, amygdala and the hypothalamus. Environmental enrichment is a robust experimental paradigm which provides a non-pharmacological tool to alter stress response and, separately, alcohol-seeking behaviour and symptoms of withdrawal. In this review, we examine and consolidate the preclinical evidence that alcohol seeking behaviour and stress induced relapse are modulated by environmental enrichment, and these are primarily mediated by modification of neural activity within the key nodes of the addiction circuitry. Finally, we discuss the limited clinical evidence that stress-reducing approaches such as mindfulness could potentially serve as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of alcoholism.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Most people consider the environment in which animals are kept to be an ethical matter, separate from the research that we conduct with them. Those of us who do research on the cognitive behavior of animals try to consider their welfare, but what we often fail to recognize is that the welfare of the animals we study can affect the results of experiments that we investigate. We have but scratched the surface of the question, how do enriched environments affect the cognitive behavior of animals, in our case pigeons. We have found that pigeons with experience in an enriched environment are less impulsive. The reduction in impulsivity results in a reduced tendency to make the suboptimal choice. It also has been claimed to make animals more optimistic, as assessed by their tendency to make choices of more favorable alternatives, under ambiguous conditions.
   The humane treatment of animals suggests that they should be housed in an environment that is rich in stimulation and allows for varied activities. However, even if one's main concern is an accurate assessment of their learning and cognitive abilities, housing them in an enriched environment can have an important effect on the assessment of those abilities. Research has found that the development of the brain of animals is significantly affected by the environment in which they live. Not surprisingly, their ability to learn both simple and complex tasks is affected by even modest time spent in an enriched environment. In particular, animals that are housed in an enriched environment are less impulsive and make more optimal choices than animals housed in isolation. Even the way that they judge the passage of time is affected by their housing conditions. Some researchers have even suggested that exposing animals to an enriched environment can make them more "optimistic" in how they treat ambiguous stimuli. Whether that behavioral effect reflects the subtlety of differences in optimism/pessimism or something simpler, like differences in motivation, incentive, discriminability, or neophobia, it is clear that the conditions of housing can have an important effect on the learning and cognition of animals.

AB  - Birds kept in commercial production systems can be exposed to multiple stressors from early life and this alters the development of different morphological, immunological and behavioural indicators. We explore the hypothesis that provision of a complex environment during early life, better prepares birds to cope with stressful events as well as buffers them against future unpredictable stressful episodes. In this study, 96 one day old pullets were randomly distributed in eight pens (12 birds/pen). Half of the chicks (N = 48) were assigned to a Complex Environment (CENV: with perches, a dark brooder etc.) the others to a Simple Environment (SENV: without enrichment features). Half of the birds from each of these treatments were assigned to a No Stress (NSTR, 33 degrees C) or to an acute Cold Stress (CSTR, 18-20 degrees C) treatment during six hours on their second day of life. At four weeks of age, chicks with these four different backgrounds were exposed to an Intermittent Stressful Challenges Protocol (ISCP). In an immunological test indicative of pro-inflammatory status Phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P), the response of CSTR birds was ameliorated by rearing chicks in a CENV as they had a similar response to NSTR chicks and a significantly better pro-inflammatory response than those CSTR birds reared in a SENV (five days after the CSTR treatment was applied). A similar better response when coping with new challenges (the ISCP) was observed in birds reared in a CENV compared to those from a SENV. Birds reared in the CENV had a lower heterophil/lymphocyte ratio after the ISCP than birds reared in SENV, independently of whether or not they had been exposed to CSTR early in life. No effects of stress on general behaviour were detected, however, the provision of a CENV increased resting behaviour, which may have favoured stress recover. Additionally, we found that exposure to cold stress at an early age might have rendered birds more vulnerable to future stressful events. CSTR birds had lower humoral immune responses (sheep red blood cells induced antibodies) after the ISCP and started using elevated structures in the CENV later compared to their NSTR conspecifics. Our study reflects the importance of the early provision of a CENV in commercial conditions to reduce negative stress-related effects. Within the context of the theory of adaptive plasticity, our results suggest that the early experience of the birds had long lasting effects on the modulation of their phenotypes.

AB  - Experimental and clinical studies suggest that prenatal experiences may influence health trajectories up to adulthood and high age. According to the hypothesis of developmental origins of health and disease exposure of pregnant women to stress, nutritional challenges, infection, violence, or war may "program" risks for diseases in later life. Stress and anxieties can exist or be provoked in parents after fertility treatment, after information or diagnosis of fetal abnormalities and demand simultaneous caring concepts to support the parents. In vulnerable groups, it is therefore important to increase the stress resilience to avoid harmful consequences for the growing child. "Enriched environment" defines a key paradigm to decipher how interactions between genes and environment change the structure and function of the brain. The regulation of the fetal hippocampal neurogenesis and morphology during pregnancy is one example of this complex interaction. Animal experiments have demonstrated that an enriched environment can revert consequences of stress in the offspring during critical periods of brain plasticity. Epigenetic markers of stress or wellbeing during pregnancy might even be diagnosed by fragments of placental DNA in the maternal circulation that show characteristic methylation patterns. The development of fetal senses further illustrates how external stimulation may impact individual preferences. Here, we therefore not only discuss how maternal stress influences cognitive development and resilience, but also design possibilities of non-invasive interventions for both mothers and children summarized and evaluated in the light of their potential to improve the health of future generations.

AB  - The importance of environment in the regulation of brain, behaviour and physiology has long been recognized in biological, social and medical sciences. Animals maintained under enriched conditions have clearly been shown to have better learning abilities than those maintained under standard conditions. However, the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on immunity and emotionality have been less documented and remain questionable. Therefore, we investigated the effect of EE on natural killer (NK) cell activity, psychological stress responses and behavioural parameters. Male C3H mice were housed either in enriched or standard conditions for 6 weeks. Behaviour was then examined by the grip-strength test, staircase and elevated plus maze, and corticosterone levels and NK cell activity were measured. Furthermore, animals exposed to the stress paradigm, achieved by electric shock with reminders, were tested for freezing time in each reminder. Corticosterone levels were also measured. The EE mice showed decreased anxiety-like behaviour and higher activity compared to standard mice, as revealed by a greater percentage of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and a higher rate of climbing the staircase. A shorter freezing time in the stress paradigm and no corticosterone level reactivity were measured in EE mice. In addition, NK cell activity in spleens of EE mice was higher than that demonstrated in those of standard mice. Thus, EE has a beneficial effect on anxiety-like behaviour, stress response and NK cell activity. The effect on NK cell activity is promising, due to the role of NK cells in host resistance.

AB  - Depression is a commonly reported co-morbidity during rehabilitation from alcohol use disorders and its presence is associated with an increased likelihood of relapse. Interventions which impede the development of depression could be of potential benefit if incorporated into treatment programs. We previously demonstrated an ameliorative effect of physical exercise on depressive behaviors in a mouse model of alcohol abstinence. Here, we show that environmental enrichment (cognitive and social stimulation) has a similar beneficial effect. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a key physiological system regulating stress responses and its dysregulation has been separably implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and addiction disorders. We performed a series of dexamethasone challenges and found that mice undergoing 2 weeks of alcohol abstinence had significantly greater corticosterone and ACTH levels following a DEX-CRH challenge compared to water controls. Environmental enrichment during alcohol abstinence corrected the abnormal DEX-CRH corticosterone response despite a further elevation of ACTH levels. Examination of gene expression revealed abstinence-associated alterations in glucocorticoid receptor (Gr), corticotrophin releasing hormone (Crh) and pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc1) mRNA levels which were differentially modulated by environmental enrichment. Overall, our study demonstrates a benefit of environmental enrichment on alcohol abstinence-associated depressive behaviors and HPA axis dysregulation.

AB  - Background: Cognitive function deficits caused by impaired neurogenesis of the brain structures are considered an important pathogenic factor in many neurological and mental diseases such as schizophrenia and depression.
   The aim of the study was to determine the effect of the enriched environment on cognitive functions and antidepressant-like effect of prenatally stressed rats. It was important to determine the effect of aripiprazole ARI and olanzapine OLA and clarify whether the enriched environment induces increases in brain derived neurothropic factor BDNF in the hippocampus in the prenatally stressed group (PSG) and non-stressed control group (NSCG).
   Methods: The effect of chronic stress applied to pregnant rats and the use of ARI (1.5 mg/kg ip) and OLA (0.5 mg/kg ip) were studied in the Morris water maze (MWM), Porsolt Forced swimming test (FST) and by determining BDNF levels.
   Results: The results indicated that enriched environment improved spatial memory and also had an antidepressant-like effect on prenatally stressed rats. ARI improved spatial memory both in the NSCG and PSG, while OLA caused memory improvement only in the PSG. Moreover, both ARI and OLA reduced immobility time in the NSCG and PSG.
   In PSG rats, BDNF decrease was observed while chronic treatment with ARI and OLA increased BDNF levels in the hippocampi of NSCG and PSG rats.
   Conclusion: It has been confirmed that enriched environment improves spatial memory of animals, removes symptoms of stress, has an antidepressant-like effect, and that new neuroleptics, such as ARI or OLA, modulate these functions (increased BDNF).

AB  - The capacity of an early environmental intervention to normalize the behavioural and immunological dysfunctions produced by a stressed pregnancy was investigated. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats underwent three 45-min sessions per day of prenatal restraint stress (PS) on gestation days 11-21, and their offspring were assigned to either an enriched-environment or standard living cages throughout adolescence [postnatal days (pnd) 22-43]. Juvenile rats from stressed pregnancies had a prominent depression of affiliative/playful behaviour and of basal circulating CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes and T4/T8 ratio. They also showed increased emotionality and spleen and brain frontal cortex levels of pro-inflammatory interleoukin-1beta (IL-1beta) cytokine. A more marked response to cyclophosphamide (CPA: two 2 mg/kg IP injections) induced immunosuppression was also found in prenatal stressed rats. Enriched housing increased the amount of time adolescent PS rats spent in positive species-typical behaviours (i.e. play behaviour), reduced emotionality and reverted most of immunological alterations. In addition to its effects in PS rats, enriched housing increased anti-inflammatory IL-2 and reduced pro-inflammatory IL-1beta production by activated splenocytes, also producing a marked alleviation of CPA-induced immune depression. In the brain, enriched housing increased IL-1beta values in hypothalamus, while slightly normalizing these values in the frontal cortex from PS rats. This is a first indication that an environmental intervention, such as enriched housing, during adolescence can beneficially affect basal immune parameters and rats response to both early stress and drug-induced immunosuppression.

AB  - Modeling depression in animals has inherent complexities that are augmented by intrinsic difficulties to measure the characteristic features of the disorder. Herein, we describe the PhenoWorld (PhW), a new setting in which groups of six rats lived in an ethological enriched environment, and have their feeding, locomotor activity, sleeping and social behavior automatically monitored. A battery of emotional and cognitive tests was used to characterize the behavioral phenotype of animals living in the PhW and in standard conditions (in groups of six and two rats), after exposure to an unpredictable chronic mild stress paradigm (uCMS) and antidepressants. Data reveal that animals living in the PhW displayed similar, but more striking, behavioral differences when exposed to uCMS, such as increased behavioral despair shown in the forced swimming test, resting/sleep behavior disturbances and reduced social interactions. Moreover, several PhW-cage behaviors, such as spontaneous will to go for food or exercise in running wheels, proved to be sensitive indicators of depressive-like behavior. In summary, this new ethological enriched paradigm adds significant discriminative power to screen depressive-like behavior, in particularly rodent's hedonic behavior.

AB  - Adverse early life experiences influence behavioral and physiological functions and increase vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. Maternal separation (MS) is an established animal model that reproduces the features of chronic stress or adverse experiences during early life. Previous studies have been shown that MS may lead to impairments of social behaviors. Here, we investigated the effects of MS on mutual reward preferences in a double T-maze prosocial choice task. Since enriched environment (EE) and intranasal oxytocin (OT) administration have beneficial effects on cognition and social behaviors, in the present study we tested whether these treatments, alone or in combination, would affect prosocial behavior of rats which underwent MS during infancy. Rat pups underwent MS paradigm for 180 min/day from postnatal day (PND) 1-21. From PND 22-34, rats were exposed to an EE and/or received intranasal OT (2 mu g/mu l, 7 days). Hence, the 8 groups consisted of control (CTRL), MS, CTRL+EE, CTRL+OT and the saline groups. Assessment of prosocial choice behavior was started in adolescence. MS impaired prosocial choice behavior and reduced mutual reward preferences. Getting exposed to EE and intranasal OT administration could overcome MS-induced deficits and promoted mutual reward preferences of MS rats. Combination of short-term EE and OT strengthened prosocial behavior. Obtained results showed that EE and OT may be considered as profitable therapeutic approaches for promoting some aspects of social behavior.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) increases cortical weight, neuronal density, dendritic branching, and angiogenesis, all of which may be critical for functional recovery following insult. Our study was designed to determine possible benefits of pre-exposure to EE in preventing functional deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the prefrontal cortex. To examine the benefit of EE, adult male rats were placed in an enriched environment for 15 days. Enrichment was provided through social interaction, exercise, olfactory stimulation, and new objects/toys to explore. Following enrichment, experimental and age-matched controls were subjected to a moderate medial prefrontal cortex injury via controlled cortical impact (CCI). After 1 week recovery, animals were behaviorally tested to assess memory, anxiety, and sensory neglect. Lesion-induced deficits in spatial memory [Morris water maze (MWM)] were significantly attenuated in EE pre-exposed rats 18-21 days following injury. In addition, TBI-induced sensory neglect was significantly reduced in EE rats relative to non-enriched animals. No differences in anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze (EPM) were detected. The behavioral data suggest that EE is neuroprotective when applied prior to TBI, resulting in improved recovery following injury.

AB  - Simple Summary Environmental enrichment is an important part of animal welfare. In this study, rare minnow in different rearing conditions underwent comprehensive evaluation regarding growth, anxiety-like behavior, and physiology parameters. Results showed that there were no differences in SGR, anxiety-like behavior, DA, DOPAC, and 5-HIAA levels between control and enriched groups. However, the enriched group had higher cortisol and 5-HT levels. Therefore, researchers should focus on the effect of environmental enrichment regarding the welfare of rare minnow and how it effects the validity of data from laboratory studies. Environmental enrichment is a method to increase environmental heterogeneity, which may reduce stress and improve animal welfare. Previous studies have shown that environmental enrichment can increase the growth rate, decrease aggressive and anxiety-like behaviors, improve learning ability and agility, and reduce cortisol levels in animals. These effects usually differ between species. Unfortunately, habitat enrichment on laboratory fish is poorly studied and seldom adopted in care guidance. Rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) have been cultured as a native laboratory fish in China in barren banks without environmental enrichment since 1990; they have been widely used in studies on ecotoxicology, environmental science, and other topics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of environment enrichment on the growth, physiological status, and anxiety-like behavior of laboratory rare minnows. We observed and analyzed SGR, cortisol levels, DA, DOPAC, 5-HT and 5-HIAA, and anxiety-like behavior indexes after one month of treatment in barren (control) and enrichment tanks. We found that there were no significant differences in SGR, anxiety-like behavior, DA, DOPAC, or 5-HIAA levels between the two treatments. However, higher cortisol and 5-HT levels were observed in the enrichment tanks. This study suggests that rare minnows might be influenced by their living environment, and future related studies should consider their environmental enrichment.

AB  - Temperament assessment is useful in reintroduction programs. Reactivity to humans and flight ability are also important behavioral aspects for captive parrots candidates to reintroduction. The study aimed: a) to evaluate if behavioral responses to environmental enrichment differ as a function of temperament in captive Vinaceous-breasted Amazon parrots (Amazona vinacea) and b) to evaluate if the behavioral responses to environmental enrichment are related to flight ability and animal's reaction to human when offered food. A temperament assessment was performed and behavioral evaluations of parrots (n = 13) using an ethogram were carried out, in two phases: unenriched and enriched. Flight skill and food reward tests were also performed. Two temperament dimensions were described ("vigilance" and "risk-taking"). Parrots categorized as "vigilant" spent less time feeding on the feeder and interacting with environment. Animals with compromised flight ability spent more time preening, had lower frequency of vocalizations, tended to have fewer negative social interactions, and interacted less with the enrichment than individuals with better flight ability. Flight performance and temperament of captive parrots should be considered while planning and executing environmental enrichment techniques.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) in rodents is associated with a wide range of physiological, affective, and cognitive benefits. A seemingly opposite housing condition, social isolation (SI), is used as a rodent model of stress, negatively affecting several neurobiological mechanisms and hampering cognitive performance. Experimental designs that involve switching between these housing conditions produced mixed results. We evaluated different behavioral and cognitive effects of brief EE following long-term, SI-induced stress. We revealed the influence of enrichment after 30 days of isolation on behavioral despair, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial working memory in adult male Wistar rats and found a substantial anxiolytic effect in the experimental (SI to EE) group. Interestingly, rats exposed to EE also showed increased behavioral despair compared with the control (continuous SI) group. There was no difference in spatial working memory performance at the end of a 5-day water Y-maze (WYM) test. However, the SI to EE animals displayed better memory performance in the first 2 days of the WYM, indicating faster learning. In line with this difference, we recorded significantly more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos+) cells in the retrosplenial and perirhinal cortices of the SI to EE animals. The lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala showed no such difference. These results suggest that brief enrichment following isolation stress leads to differential results in affective and cognitive systems.

AB  - Environmental conditions, such as stress and environmental enrichment (EE), influence predisposition to alcohol use/abuse; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To assess the effect of environmental conditions on the initial rewarding effects of alcohol, we examined conditioned place-preference (CPP) to alcohol following exposure to EE in mice. Since social context is a major factor contributing to initial alcohol-drinking, we also assessed the impact of EE on the levels of the "social neuropeptide" oxytocin (OT) and its receptor, OTR. Finally, we assessed the effect of pharmacological manipulations of the oxytocinergic system on EE-induced alcohol CPP. While EE increased sociability and reduced anxiety-like behaviors, it caused a similar to 3.5-fold increase in alcohol reward compared to controls. EE triggered profound neuroadaptations of the oxytocinergic system; it increased hypothalamic OT levels and decreased OTR binding in the prefrontal cortex and olfactory nuclei of the brain. Repeated administration of the OT analogue carbetocin (6.4 mg/kg/day) mimicked the behavioral effects of EE on ethanol CPP and induced similar brain region-specific alterations of OTR binding as those observed following EE. Conversely, repeated administration of the OTR antagonist L,369-899 (5 mg/kg/day) during EE exposure, but not during the acquisition of alcohol CPP, reversed the pronounced EE-induced ethanol rewarding effect. These results demonstrate for the first time, a stimulatory effect of environmental enrichment exposure on alcohol reward via an oxytocinergic-dependent mechanism, which may predispose to alcohol abuse. This study offers a unique prospective on the neurobiological understanding of the initial stages of alcohol use/misuse driven by complex environmental-social interplay. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Resilience, the degree to which individuals are physiologically and behaviourally impacted by stressors, can be enhanced by positive experiences (e.g. positive moods in human, environmental enrichment in rodents). Such effects are important for human health, but could also have important animal welfare implications in terms of farm, laboratory and zoo animals' abilities to cope with stressors. Here we investigated whether enrichments can increase resilience in chickens, the world's most abundant agricultural animal. The stress reactivity of laying hens housed for 5-6 weeks in enriched environments was compared to that of controls housed in smaller, emptier, less preferred pens, via: 1) startle reflex amplitudes to an abrupt, intense sensory stimulus (a light flash); and 2) autonomic responses to restraint and the sudden appearance of a novel object, assessed from decreases in comb temperature. Startle amplitudes were consistently reduced in the enriched hens, exerted with around one sixth the force seen in control hens. Maximum comb temperature decreases, and latencies for comb temperatures to return to prestress levels, also both fell by around a third. Enrichment thus reduced hens' intrinsic behavioural and physiological responses to standardized stressors (doing so even outside the home pen), just as occurs in laboratory rodents. Enrichment also reduced baseline comb temperature, suggesting that this could be a non-invasive indicator of welfare. Altered judgment biases did not seem to be the mechanism. Further work should now investigate the processes underlying the apparently enhanced stress resilience of animals housed in preferred conditions, and also investigate baseline comb temperature as a chronic stress indicator in poultry.

AB  - Background Discriminating between adolescents who will eventually have ethanol use problems from those who do not is important. Environmental enrichment is a promising approach to reduce drug-related problems, but its impact on ethanol's effects and intake is being scrutinized.Objective: We tested the effects of environmental enrichment on ethanol intake, preference, and anxiety-like response as well as shelter seeking and risk-taking behaviors. Methods Experiment 1 examined ethanol intake, preference, and anxiety-like responses in 46 male and 54 female Wistar rats that were derived from a short-term breeding program that selected for high and low ethanol drinking during adolescence (ADHI(2)and ADLO(2)lines, respectively). Shelter-seeking and risk-taking behaviors were assessed (Experiment 2) in ADHI(2)and ADLO(2)rats (73 males, 76 females) reared under environmental enrichment or standard housing conditions and given doses of ethanol (2.5 g/kg, intraperitoneal) for 3 weeks. Environmental enrichment was applied on postnatal days 21-42. Ethanol intake was measured on postnatal days 42-68. Anxiety-like behavior and exploratory responses were assessed using the light-dark box and multivariate concentric square field test. Results In Experiment 1, environmental enrichment increased ethanol intake in female, but not male, ADHI(2)and ADLO(2)rats (p < 0.05). In the baseline measurement of Experiment 2, ADHI(2)rats exhibited reduced risk-taking and increased anxiety-like behavior (p < .05). After exposure to environmental enrichment the ADHI and ADLO rats, both males and females, exhibited increased risk-taking and exploratory behavior (p < 0.05). Conclusions Environmental enrichment appears to increase ethanol intake in female rats by promoting the exploration of new environments or stimuli. The findings indicate that environmental enrichment increased ethanol intake in female, but not male, rats. Clinical programs that treat alcohol use disorder by emphasizing environmental stimulation should be designed with caution.

AB  - We have previously shown that 3xTgAD mice (triple-transgenic mice for Alzheimer's disease, harboring PS1(M146V), A beta PPSwe, tau(P301L) transgenes) suffer detrimental changes in some key lymphocyte functions, described as health and longevity markers, with males being more affected than females and showing higher mortality rates. In the present work, 3xTgAD and wild type 129/C57BL6 male and female non-and environmentally enriched mice were used. The enriched environment (EE) began in the adulthood (6 months) and lasted for 5.5 months. The animals were sacrificed at advanced stages of the disease (15 month-old), and spleen, thymus, and plasma were obtained. The results indicate that 3xTg-AD males are especially benefitted from EE exposure, as shown by the improvement in lymphocyte functional activities such as chemotaxis and natural killer cytotoxicity, as well as in plasma corticosterone levels. By contrast, wild type females seem to be highly sensitive to EE removal, as regards the proliferation capacity of lymphocytes and their intracellular glutathione content. These results support the relevance of gender differences in AD when screening for new strategies for the control of the disease, and suggest that active life, by means of EE, should be maintained until natural death in order to preserve all the positive effects that this strategy exerts on the immune system.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is typically associated with enhanced well-being, improved cognitive function and stress resilience. However, in some instances grouping adult male mice in enriched conditions promoted a stressful environment, which resulted in elevated endocrine, monoamine and inflammatory outcomes in response to subsequent stressor exposure. The current investigation examined whether raising male mice in an enriched environment (EE) would modulate social and anxiety-like behaviors in early adulthood and influence brain expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Immediately after weaning (postnatal day [PD] 21), CD-1 male mice were housed with their siblings (3/cage) for 6 weeks in an EE or a standard (SE) environment. Body weights and aggressive interactions were monitored weekly. Social avoidance behaviors in the social interaction test and anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated-plus maze were examined in early adulthood. Ninety minutes following the behavioral tests, mice were sacrificed and a blood sample and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were collected for the determination of plasma corticosterone levels as well as cytokine and BDNF mRNA expression. Mice raised in an EE exhibited more wounds and gained less weight than mice housed in a SE. Enriched mice also spent a greater amount of time in proximity of a social target in the social interaction test and made fewer transitions into the closed arms of the elevated-plus maze. Interestingly, the elevated plasma corticosterone and upregulated prefrontal interleukin (IL)-1 beta expression observed after the social interaction test among the SE mice were not apparent among those housed in an EE. Enrichment also increased prefrontal BDNF expression, especially among mice that experienced the social interaction test. These results suggest that although raising male mice in an EE may elicit aggressive interactions between sibling cage-mates (as indicated by a high number of wounds), this environment also enhances social behaviors and limits the corticosterone and cytokine impacts of mild social stressors encountered in early adulthood.

AB  - This study investigated the relationships among an enriched environment, stress levels, and drug addiction. Mice were divided randomly into four treatment groups (n= 12 each): enriched environment without restraint stress (EN), standard environment without restraint stress (SN), enriched environment with restraint stress (ES), and standard environment with restraint stress (SS). Mice were reared in the respective environment for 45 days. Then, the ES and SS groups were subjected to restraint stress daily (2 h/day) for 14 days, whereas the EN and SN groups were not subjected to restraint stress during this stage. The stress levels of all mice were tested in the elevated plus maze immediately after exposure to restraint stress. After the 2-week stress testing period, mice were administered acute or chronic morphine (5 mg/kg) treatment for 7 days. Then, after a 7-day withdrawal period, the mice were injected with saline (1 ml/kg) or morphine (5 mg/kg) daily for 2 days to observe locomotor activity. The results indicated that the enriched environment reduced the stress and locomotor activity induced by acute morphine administration or saline after chronic morphine treatment. However, the enriched environment did not significantly inhibit locomotor activity induced by morphine challenge. In addition, the stress level did not mediate the effect of the enriched environment on drug-induced locomotor activity after acute or chronic morphine treatment.

AB  - Prenatal stress (PS) can produce profound and long-lasting perturbations of individual adaptive capacities, which in turn can result in an increased proneness to behavioural disorders. Indeed, in PS rats there is evidence of impaired social play behaviour, disturbances in a variety of circadian rhythms, enhanced anxiety and increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. This study was designed to experimentally investigate the degree of reversibility of PS-induced disturbances of social play and HPA reactivity by assessing the effect of the enrichment of the physical environment on PS rats during periadolescence. PS subjects showed a reduced expression of social play behaviour and a prolonged corticosterone secretion in response to restraint stress, but both these effects were markedly reversed following environmental enrichment. Interestingly, the enrichment procedure increased social behaviour but had no effect on corticosterone secretion in nonstressed animals, indicating a differential impact of the postnatal environment as a function of prenatal background. As a whole, results clearly indicate that rats prenatally exposed to stress can benefit during periadolescence from the modulatory effects of an enriched environment. Moreover, they confirm that PS may well represent a suitable animal model for the design and testing of new therapeutic strategies for behavioural disorders produced by early insults.

AB  - Exposure to cocaine in early periods of postnatal life is usually associated with changes in development of neurotransmitter systems and structure of the central nervous System. Such changes are most likely correlated with behavioral alterations. Environmental enrichment conditions (EC) in early stages is a factor that affects structural and behavioral development. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of EC on rats postnatally exposed to cocaine on exploratory behavior. Wistar rats were assigned to four groups-Group 1: pups exposed to cocaine hydrochloride (15 mg/kg body weight/day) s.c., in two daily doses, from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 28 and reared in EC; Group 2: pups exposed to cocaine as previously described and reared in a standard environmental conditions (SC); Group 3: pups saline-injected and reared in EC; and Group 4: pups saline-injected and reared in SC. On PND 21, 24, and 28, groups of four rats (to reduce anxiety) were placed for 10 minutes into an arena with several objects. The following exploratory behavioral categories were examined: object interaction, exploration, manipulation, approximation, and total time of object contact. Animals from Group 2 showed decreased object interaction and total contact on PND 21. Control offspring reared in EE showed decreases in exploratory behavior at all ages analyzed compared with the control SE group, while cocaine-exposed animals reared in EC showed decreased object interaction, object approximation, and total exploratory behavior. The results in this group suggest that EC improved information acquisition and memory processes in animals postnatally exposed to cocaine.

AB  - In order to determine the effect of postnatal environments on some behavioral and neurochemical depressive-like parameters, mate Sprague-Dawley rats were reared from weaning in either social isolation, standard laboratory conditions, or environmental enrichment. Open-field activity was assessed at postnatal days 37, 65, 93 and 107 and I h before the last open-field test, a forced-swimming test was carried out. After behavioral tests, the monoamines concentrations were analyzed in prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Relative to control and isolation rearing, the environmental enrichment reduced open-field activity, led to antidepressive-like effects and increased serotonin concentrations in the prefrontal cortex. Social isolation, on the other hand, did not affect open-field activity, but increased depressive-like behavior and reduced the amount of norepinephrine in the ventral striatum. Those neurochemical changes induced by rearing conditions correlated with the behavioral performance in the forced-swimming test. Also, immobility behavior could be predicted by locomotor activity even from the first week of housing. Overall, specific variations in physical and social environment during early rearing lead to some behavioral and neurochemical alterations which might be relevant for understanding the role that neurodevelopmental and experiential factors could have in human depression.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is a powerful stimulus of brain plasticity and is among the most accessible treatment options for brain disease. In rodents, EE is modeled using multi-factorial environments that include running, social interactions, and/or complex surroundings. Here, we show that running and running-independent EE differentially affect the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), a brain region critical for learning and memory. Outbred male CD1 mice housed individually with a voluntary running disk showed improved spatial memory in the radial arm maze compared to individually-or socially-housed mice with a locked disk. We therefore used RNA sequencing to perform an unbiased interrogation of DG gene expression in mice exposed to either a voluntary running disk (RUN), a locked disk (LD), or a locked disk plus social enrichment and tunnels [i.e., a running-independent complex environment (CE)]. RNA sequencing revealed that RUN and CE mice showed distinct, non-overlapping patterns of transcriptomic changes versus the LD control. Bio-informatics uncovered that the RUN and CE environments modulate separate transcriptional networks, biological processes, cellular compartments and molecular pathways, with RUN preferentially regulating synaptic and growth-related pathways and CE altering extracellular matrix-related functions. Within the RUN group, high-distance runners also showed selective stress pathway alterations that correlated with a drastic decline in overall transcriptional changes, suggesting that excess running causes a stress-induced suppression of running's genetic effects. Our findings reveal stimulus-dependent transcriptional signatures of EE on the DG, and provide a resource for generating unbiased, data-driven hypotheses for novel mediators of EE-induced cognitive changes.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is a largely employed behavioral procedure in which animals are exposed to high stimulation compared with conventional housing conditions. Animal exposure to an EE exerts beneficial effects on the performance of different learning tasks and induces a number of behavioral, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical changes including hippocampal cell proliferation. However, the importance of voluntary interaction with the environment in these changes has not been clearly resolved yet. Moreover, the effects of a complex environment on animal emotionality still remains questionable and has not been explored in detail under conditions that allow unmasking individual responses among subjects in a group. The present study was aimed at exposing groups of rats to an EE, and analyzing individual differences in activity levels during EE sessions. We observed differences with respect to the activity level displayed by rats during the enriched sessions, which correlated with differences in the rate of hippocampal cell proliferation. It is suggested that exposure to EE may reduce anxiety-like behaviors and may elicit individual differences on emotional reactions positively linked with hippocampal neurogenesis and testosterone levels.

AB  - Objective-To compare acoustic startle reflexes (ASRs) of healthy cats and cats with interstitial cystitis (IC).
   Animals-28 healthy cats (11 males and 17 females) and 20 cats with IC (13 males and 7 females).
   Procedures-To evaluate the effect of neutering on ASRs, ASRs in neutered and unneutered healthy cats were measured. To evaluate the effect of housing facility acclimation on ASRs in cats with IC, ASRs were measured in cats with IC within 1 month after arrival at the housing facility and again 2 to 3 months after arrival. To evaluate the effect of the environment on ASRs, ASRs were evaluated in all cats with and without IC after acclimation but before and then after environmental enrichment.
   Results-Neutering led to a significant decrease in overall ASR in the healthy cats. Habituation to the housing facility resulted in a significant decrease in overall ASR of female but not male cats with IC. Environmental enrichment led to a significant decrease in ASR in cats with IC but not in healthy cats.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The magnitude of the ASR appeared to be sensitive to environmental conditions and affected by sex, both in healthy cats and cats with IC. It was also higher in cats with IC versus healthy cats, except when cats were housed in a highly enriched environment. Impact for Human Medicine Treatment approaches that include reduction of a patient's perception of environmental unpredictability may benefit humans with IC. (Am J Vet Res 2013;74:144-147)

AB  - Mice lacking the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) (PACAP(-/-)) display behavioral abnormalities, and genetic variants of the genes encoding PACAP are associated with schizophrenia. Clinical studies show that environmental factors, besides genetic factors, play a key role in etiology of many psychiatric disorders. This study examined the effects of environmental factors such as short-term social isolation and an enriched environment on behavioral abnormalities of PACAP-/- mice. Rearing in isolation for 2-weeks from 4-weeks old induced hyperlocomotion and aggressive behaviors in the PACAP(-/-) mice without affecting the behavioral performance of the wild-type controls. Adult PACAP(-/-) mice showed not only hyperactivity, jumping behavior, and depression-like behavior, but also decreased social interaction. These abnormal behaviors were improved by rearing for 4-weeks in an early enriched environment (from 4-weeks old), although the deficits of prepulse inhibition (PPI) were not influenced by the enriched condition. In contrast, rearing for 4-weeks in late enriched environment (from 8-weeks old) did not affect the hyperactivity and jumping behaviors in the PACAP(-/-) mice. These results suggest that abnormal behaviors except PPI deficits in PACAP(-/-) mice depend on the environmental factors during the early stages of development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Stress is linked to negative cardiovascular consequences and increases in depressive behaviors. Environmental enrichment (EE) involves exposure to novel items that provide physical and cognitive stimulation. EE has behavioral, cognitive, and neurobiological effects that may improve stress responses in humans and animal models. This study investigated the potential protective effects of EE on behavior and cardiovascular function in female prairie voles after a social stressor.
   Methods: Radiotelemetry transmitters were implanted into female prairie voles to measure heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) throughout the study. All females were paired with a male partner for 5 days, followed by separation from their partner for 5 additional days, and a 10-day treatment period. Treatment consisted of continued isolation, isolation with EE, or re-pairing with the partner (n = 9 per group). After treatment, animals were observed in the forced swim test (FST) for measures of stress coping behaviors.
   Results: Isolation elevated HR and reduced HRV relative to baseline for all groups (p < .001). HR and HRV returned to baseline in the EE and re-paired groups, but not in the continued isolation group (p < .001). Animals in the EE and re-paired groups displayed significantly lower immobility time (p < .001) and HR (p < .03) during the FST, with a shorter latency for HR to return to baseline levels after the FST, relative to the continued isolation group (p < .001).
   Conclusions: EE and re-pairing reversed the negative behavioral and cardiovascular consequences associated with social isolation.

AB  - Prenatal stress can cause long-term effects on cognitive functions in offspring. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity, believed to be the mechanism underlying certain types of learning and memory, and known to be sensitive to behavioral stress, can be changed by prenatal stress. Whether enriched environment treatment (EE) in early postnatal periods can cause a recovery from these deficits is unknown. Experimental animals were Wistar rats. Prenatal stress was evoked by 10 foot shocks (0.8 mA for 1 s, 2-3 min apart) in 30 min per day at gestational day 13-19. After weaning at postnatal day 22, experimental offspring were given the enriched environment treatment through all experiments until tested (older than 52 days age). Electrophysiological and Morris water maze testing was performed at 8 weeks of age. The results showed that prenatal stress impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) but facilitated long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA1 region in the slices. Furthermore, prenatal stress exacerbated the effects of acute stress on hippocampal LTP and LTD, and also impaired spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze. However, all these deficits induced by prenatal stress were recovered by enriched environment treatment. This work observes a phenomenon that may contribute to the understanding of clinically important interactions among cognitive deficit, prenatal stress and enriched environment treatment. Enriched environment treatment on early postnatal periods may be one potentially important target for therapeutic interventions in preventing the prenatal stress-induced cognitive disorders.

AB  - Interest in cognitive research in pigs is increasing, but little is known about the impact of environmental conditions on pigs' cognitive capabilities. The present study investigated the effect of environmental enrichment on cognitive performance of pigs in a holeboard spatial task, in which they had to discriminate four baited buckets out of 16. Pigs (n = 32) were either housed in stimulus-poor, barren pens, or in larger pens enriched with rooting substrates. Pigs were subjected to 30 holeboard trials. Both working memory (WM), that is, the ratio (baited visits/total number of (re)visits to baited buckets), and reference memory (RM), that is, the ratio ((re)visits to baited buckets/total number of visits to all buckets), improved over trials. WM scores were higher in pigs from enriched pens than in pigs from barren pens. Housing did not affect RM scores. Personality type of the pigs, as assessed early in life using a backtest, did not affect WM or RM. In conclusion, housing conditions of pigs did not affect reference memory, but environmental enrichment improved working memory of pigs in a spatial discrimination task. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest that cognitive functioning of pigs may be impaired under commonly used housing conditions.

AB  - While the efficacy of pharmacological interventions to treat depression has been well-studied in animal models, much less work has been done to shed light on how changes in the immediate environment can impact behaviour. Furthermore, most studies have focused on male rodents despite the prevalence of mood disorders in women. In this study, 36 Wistar Kyoto (validated animal model of depression) and 36 Wistar (control) female rats were used to examine the effects of environmental manipulation on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours. Animals were assigned to one of three groups: standard (3 rats/cage), enriched (6 rats/cage plus physical enrichment), and isolation (1 rat/cage) housing. The elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST) were conducted prior to, and four weeks after environmental assignment to measure anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviours, respectively. Sucrose preference assessed anhedonia both before and after environmental assignment. Weight was measured every week to monitor weight-gain over time. Post-environment sucrose preference was significantly increased in animals in enriched housing as compared to those in isolated housing in both strains. While there were significant differences between strains in measures of open arm duration in the EPM and immobility in the FST, there appeared to be no differences between environmental groups. The results of this study highlight the importance of environmental factors in the expression of anhedonia. Enrichment appears to reduce anhedonia while isolation increases anhedonia. These effects should be studied further to assess whether longer periods of social and physical enrichment alleviate other symptoms of depression. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An enriched environment can promote adaptability of animals to cope with complex environments. A total of 18-week-old 216 laying hens were randomly divided into 2 groups; of which, one group was housed in conventional battery cages (CC, n = 36), and the others were housed in furnished cages (FC, n = 180). At the end of 64 wk of age, 24 chickens of each group were selected for 4-hour transport treatment. The spleen tissues of laying hens were collected before transportation (BT), immediately after transportation, and at 48 h after transportation to detect the expression of the heat shock protective response signaling pathway and inflammatory factors. Serum samples were collected to detect the content of immune cytokines. Transport stress decreased heat shock proteins (HSP; including Small HSP, HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HS70, HSP90, HSP110) in the CC group (P 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in the expression of HSP (except for Small HSP and HSP40) in the FC group (P 0.05) immediately after transportation. At 48 h after transportation, mRNA levels of HSP (except for Small HSP and HSP40) in the FC group were upregulated, which were higher than those at BT (P < 0.05). The changes in HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 protein levels had similar tendencies. The results showed that housing in furnished cages alleviated the inhibition of expression of HSP in the hens' spleen induced by transport stress. In addition, the hens housed in the FC group had lower expression levels of proinflammatory factors (nuclear transcription factor-kappa B, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin E synthase, inflammatory cytokines [IL-1b and IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor alpha) (P < 0.05). We suggest that the enriched environment can reduce transport stress damage in laying hens and improve resistance to transport stress by regulating expression of heat shock response proteins and inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Early environment often has profound effects on phenotypic development that last throughout the lifetime. It has been suggested that unpredictable environments may favor cognitive abilities. However, cognitive challenges during development may result in life-history trade-offs, because complex neural reorganization required for coping with these challenges entails stress and energy costs. In this study, we experimentally tested whether early exposure to different cognitive challenges influences cognitive ability, brain size and life-history traits in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). For this, juvenile sticklebacks were challenged over a 2-month period to resolve four different learning tasks. Contrary to our predictions, individuals trained in learning tasks later showed a reduced ability to solve a new maze task, suggesting that these learning tasks during early life may impair the ability to cope with new cognitive challenges. Females from the learning task group showed smaller optic tectum volume than the control females. Fish from the learning task treatment reduced their growth during the experiment, then accelerated growth to catch up until the breeding season. Sticklebacks reared in an environment with learning tasks also suffered a greater mortality than the controls both during and after the experiment. For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrated direct costs of living in environments with cognitive challenges by tracking long-term performances of sticklebacks exposed to dynamic challenges during early life. Our results show that environmental challenges during ontogeny trigger plastic responses, but contrary to the common belief, do not improve the ability to cope with new cognitive challenges.

AB  - The adverse effects of stress on brain and behavior have long been known and well-studied, with abundant evidence linking stress to, among other things, mood and anxiety disorders. Likewise, many have investigated potential treatments for stress-related mood and anxiety phenotypes and demonstrated good response to standard antidepressant medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as well as environmental manipulations like exercise or enrichment. However, the extent to which stress and various treatments act on overlapping pathways in the brain is less well understood. Here, we used a widely studied social defeat stress paradigm to induce a robust depression- and anxiety-like phenotype and chronic corticosterone elevation that persisted for at least 4 weeks in wild type male mice. When mice were treated with either the SSRI fluoxetine or an enriched environment, both led to similar behavioral recovery from social defeat. We then focused on the amygdala and assessed the effects of social defeat, fluoxetine, and enrichment on 168 genes broadly related to synaptic plasticity or oxidative stress. We found 24 differentially expressed genes in response to social defeat stress. Interestingly, fluoxetine led to broad normalization of the stress-induced expression pattern while enrichment led to expression changes in a separate set of genes. Together, this study provides additional insight into the chronic effects of social defeat stress on behavior and gene expression in the amygdala. The findings also suggest that, for a subset of genes assessed, fluoxetine and environmental enrichment have strikingly divergent effects on expression in the amygdala, despite leading to similar behavioral outcomes.

AB  - Our previous work has shown that male Sprague-Dawley rats reared in social isolation, standard housing and environmental enrichment differ in their spontaneous open-field activity and in some neurobehavioral depressive-like parameters. Here, we extended this evidence by using a shorter postweaning rearing period (I month) and including additional evaluations. First, in order to obtain a better characterization of the exploratory strategies among rearing conditions we analyzed in detail the spontaneous activity at the first minute and during the 10-min session. Second, we asked whether the changes in open-field activity were related with basal anxiety levels in the elevated plus-maze. Third, behavior in the forced-swimming test was analyzed and afterward, the tissue levels of hippocampal norepinephrine and serotonin were assessed. The possible relationship between neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behavior were explored through correlation analyses. We found that rearing conditions (i) differed on locomotor habituation and on sensory-motor exploration at the first minute and during the 10-min session without modifying the plus-maze behavior: (ii) affected differentially the grooming time, its sequential components, and the relationship between grooming and locomotor parameters; (iii) modified forced-swimming behavior and the hippocampal concentration of norepinephrine, serotonin, and its turnover; and (iv) produced different correlation patterns between both neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behaviors. Overall, environmental enrichment accelerated open-field habituation and led to behavioral and neurochemical antidepressant-like effects. In contract, isolation rearing strongly impaired habituation and simple information processing, but showed marginal effects on depressive-like behavior and on hippocampal neurochemistry. The current results suggest that differential rearing is not only a useful procedure to study behavioral plasticity or rigidity in response to early experience, but also to modeling some developmental protective or risk factors underlying depressive disorders.

AB  - To discover whether the accumulation of life's experiences, adverse and enriching, inform, and serve the following generation by inheritance we examine whether stress to a weanling female will influence her future offspring, whether prereproductive enrichment to the dam, or postweaning enrichment to the offspring, can reverse the transgenerational effects of stress, and whether, like adversity, enrichment might have transgenerational effects. Female rats were exposed to stressors when they were 2729 days old. Half of these females and their controls were then raised in an enriched environment from weaning until mating at 60 days to examine whether preproduction enrichment reverses the effects of preproduction stress on offspring. Half of the offspring of each group were raised in an enriched environment after weaning, to see whether it reverses the effects of preproduction stress and buttresses prereproductive enrichment. Behavior was examined in 625 adult offspring in 16 groups covering all permutations of the experimental variables (preproduction weanling stress (PS), preproduction enrichment (PE), offspring enrichment (OE), sex). Exploration, avoidance learning, startle, and social interaction were tested. Results reveal that very early prereproductive experience in females, adverse or enriching, will transgenerationally influence their future offspring, depending on the behavior tested and sex. Our finding that enrichment, whether to the parent or offspring generation, can ameliorate the transgenerational impact of adversity, has novel implications for the malleability of transgenerational inheritance, and its individual, social, and therapeutic impact.

AB  - Environmental enrichment induces behavioral and structural modifications in rodents and influences the capability of mice to cope with stress. However, little is understood about hippocampal neurogenesis and the appearance of social/agonistic (aggressive) behavior upon activation of different neuronal circuits in FVB/N mice. Thus, in this study we hypothesized that environmental enrichment differentially regulates neurogenesis, neural circuit activation and social/agonistic behavior in male and female FVB/N mice. We explored the (1) neurogenic process as an indicative of neuroplasticity, (2) neuronal activation in the limbic system, and (3) social behavior using the resident-intruder test. On postnatal day 23 (PD23), mice were assigned to one of two groups: Standard Housing or Environmental Enrichment. At PD53, rodents underwent the resident-intruder test to evaluate social behaviors. Results revealed that environmental enrichment increased neurogenesis and social interaction in females. In males, environmental enrichment increased neurogenesis and agonistic behavior. Enriched male mice expressed higher levels of agonistic-related behavior than female mice housed under the same conditions. Neural circuit analysis showed lower activation in the amygdala of enriched males and higher activation in enriched females than their respective controls. Enriched females also showed higher activation in the frontal cortex without differences in male groups. Moreover, the insular cortex was less activated in females than in males. Thus, our results indicate that environmental enrichment has different effects on neuroplasticity and social/agonistic behavior in FVB/N mice, suggesting the relevance of sexual dimorphism in response to environmental stimuli.

AB  - In laboratory rats, one of the most used paradigms to assess habituation to novelty is the open-field test. Environmental enrichment has proved to be a reliable way to enhance open-field test habituation. Experiment 1, therefore, was designed to test whether grooming behaviour in the open-field test increases concomitantly with the habituation of exploratory behaviours (locomotion and rearing behaviour, an alert upright posture). To this aim, after a baseline measure, rats were raised in environmentally enriched and standard housing conditions and then tested 30 and 60 days later. As some grooming subtypes are differentially displayed in the open-field test, we hypothesized that only the grooming subtype that included longer and more complex sequences (e.g. body licking) would increase with habituation. We found that environmental enrichment enhanced short-term (within days) and long-term (between days) open-field test habituation, and increased grooming, particularly body licking. To provide evidence that grooming in the open-field test is part of the habituation process and not a by-product of environmental enrichment, habituation was promoted by exposing a different group of rats that had been reared in standard housing to four consecutive open-field tests in experiment 2. We supposed that the diminution of exploratory open-field test behaviours would be accompanied by an increase in body licking. We found that as locomotion and rearing behaviour decreased, body licking increased gradually both within and between days, suggesting that the appearance of more complex and longer grooming sequences are part of a de-arousal inhibition system subserving novelty habituation. A detailed analysis of grooming, therefore, may provide information about the emotional state of the rat that cannot otherwise be obtained from assessing exploratory activity.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that paternal stress in rodents can result in modification of offspring behavior. Environmental enrichment, which enhances cognitive stimulation and physical activity, modifies various behaviors and reduces stress responses in adult rodents. We investigated the transgenerational influence of paternal environmental enrichment on offspring behavior and physiological stress response. Adult C57BL/6J male mice (F0) were exposed to either environmental enrichment or standard housing for four weeks and then pair-mated with naive females. The F2 generation was generated using F1 male offspring. Male and female F1 and F2 offspring were tested for anxiety using the elevated-plus maze and large open field at 8 weeks of age. Depression-related behavior was assessed using the forced-swim test. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function was determined by quantification of serum corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels at baseline and after forced-swim stress. Paternal environmental enrichment was associated with increased body weights of male F1 and F2 offspring. There was no significant effect on F1 offspring anxiety and depression-related behaviors. There were no changes in anxiety-related behaviors in the F2 offspring, however these mice displayed a reduced latency to immobility in the forced-swim test. Furthermore, F2 females had significantly higher serum corticosterone levels post-stress, but not ACTH. These results show that paternal environmental enrichment exerts a sex-specific transgenerational impact on the behavioral and physiological response to stress. Our findings have implications for the modelling of psychiatric disorders in rodents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hippocampus of rodents undergoes structural remodeling throughout adulthood, including the addition of new neurons. Adult neurogenesis is sensitive to environmental enrichment and stress. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, are involved in adult neurogenesis by engulfing dying new neurons. While previous studies using laboratory environmental enrichment have investigated alterations in brain structure and function, they do not provide an adequate reflection of living in the wild, in which stress and environmental instability are common. Here, we compared mice living in standard laboratory settings to mice living in outdoor enclosures to assess the complex interactions among environment, gut infection, and hippocampal plasticity. We infected mice with parasitic worms and studied their effects on adult neurogenesis, microglia, and functions associated with the hippocampus, including cognition and anxiety regulation. We found an increase in immature neuron numbers of mice living in outdoor enclosures regardless of infection. While outdoor living prevented increases in microglial reactivity induced by infection in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, outdoor mice with infection had fewer microglia and microglial processes in the ventral hippocampus. We observed no differences in cognitive performance on the hippocampus-dependent object location task between infected and uninfected mice living in either setting. However, we found that infection caused an increase in anxiety-like behavior in the open field test but only in outdoor mice. These findings suggest that living conditions, as well as gut infection, interact to produce complex effects on brain structure and function.

AB  - Maternal separation (MS) early in life is related to an increase in anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and neurobiological alterations mostly related to alterations in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. Environmental enrichment (EE) has been used to ameliorate the effects of MS. However, the outcomes of this intervention at different developmental periods after MS have not been studied. We subjected male and female Sprague-Dawley pups to MS and subsequently compared the effects of EE started either in the pre-pubertal period [postnatal day (PND) 22] or adulthood (PND 78). Anxiety and depressive-like behaviors as well as in hippocampal synaptic density and basal corticosterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin levels were measured. Our results support the beneficial effects of adulthood EE in decreasing anxiety in males as well as promoting synaptic density in ventral hippocampal CA3. Males displayed higher levels of vasopressin while females displayed higher oxytocin, with no changes in basal corticosterone for any group after EE.

AB  - An eco-friendly layered-porous C-BC surface was prepared by intercalating properties of layered bentonite clay (C) having high cation-exchange capacity, with biochar (BC), containing pores and vast functionality, and utilized to support redox-sensitive zerovalent iron (nZVI) nanotrident particles. The synthesized C-BCnZVI nanotrident was characterized for morphology, porosity, crystallinity, functionality, and suspension stability and then evaluated for various environmental applications such as REE extraction, toxic metal removal, and sorption of dyes. Results show heterogeneous pore distribution on the C-BC-nZVI surface with dispersed-unoxidized 20-30 nm sized nZVI particles. C-BC-nZVI had shown 100% extraction of REEs (La, Ce, and Nd) along with >90% removal of various toxic metals (As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Hg, and Pb). In the dye mixture, the nanotrident showed selective sorption of methylene blue (MB). The impact of environmental complexities on the nanotrident's reactivity for metals and MB dye was further delineated using CrO42-, Ni2+, and MB. Results show no influence of pH and dissolved organic matter (DOM) variation on Ni2+ and MB sorption. Further efficient sorption, reduction, and coprecipitation of all the contaminants, i.e., CrO42- (44.3 mg/g), Ni2+ (570.5 mg/g), and MB (52.1 mg/g) in groundwater and <10 mu g/L release in the elute obtained from the continuous flow column until the breakthrough point confirms the multifunctionality and applicability of the nanotrident in the natural environment.

AB  - Stress affects psychomotor profiles and exploratory behavior in response to environmental features. Here we investigated psychomotor and exploratory patterns induced by stress in a simple open-field arena and a complex, multi-featured environment. Groups of rats underwent seven days of restraint stress or no-stress conditions and were individually tested in three versions of the ziggurat task (ZT) that varied according to environmental complexity. The hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis due to stress procedure was evaluated by the pre- and post-stress levels of circulating corticosterone (CORT). Horizontal activity, exploration, and motivation were measured by the number of fields entered, the time spent in the central fields, path length and speed, and stop duration. In addition, vertical exploratory behavior was measured by the times rats climbed onto ziggurats. Stress-induced psychomotor changes were indicated by reduced path length and path speed and increased duration of stops only within the complex arena of the ZT. Rats in stress groups also showed a significant decline in the vertical movements as measured by the number of climbing onto ziggurats. No stress-induced changes were revealed by the simple open-field arena. The exploratory patterns of stressed animals suggest psychomotor inhibition and reduced novelty-seeking behaviors in an environment-dependent manner. Thus, multi-featured arenas that require complex behavioral strategies are ideally suited to reveal the inhibitory effects of stress on psychomotor capabilities in rodents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Context. Music induces physiological responses in animals, and as an enriched environment, it may have a positive effect on behaviour and productivity.
   Aims. This study aimed to determine the effects of different kinds of music on immunity, stress response and performance of piglets.
   Methods. In total, 144 hybrid piglets (Yorkshire x Durac x Minpig) at the age of 7 weeks were divided into three treatment groups: slow-tempo string music (65 beats per min), fast-tempo wind music (200 beats per min), and control (i.e. no music). Exposure to music lasted for 42 days, from 8 to 14 weeks of age. During the experimental period, behavioural activities were observed, and physiological parameters, immune responses and growth performance were measured.
   Key results. Results showed that long-term music exposure increased (P < 0.01) playing and tail-wagging behaviours compared with the control group, but had no effect (P > 0.05) on walking, lying, exploring, fighting or feeding behaviours. No effect (P > 0.05) was found on the levels of growth hormone, salivary cortisol, serum cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, beta-endorphin or dopamine, or on the performance of growing pigs. However, the specific music type slow-tempo string significantly (P < 0.05) increased interleukin-4.
   Conclusions. Long-term exposure to music does not affect stress response or growth performance in piglets. However, it promotes positive mood as indicated by increased playing and tail-wagging activities, and induces positive immunomodulation through increased interleukin-4 levels in piglets.
   Implications. Exposure to music may be used to promote positive mood, and hence enhance welfare, in piglets.

AB  - Chronic stress can cause emotional dysfunction, but exposure to an enriched environment (EE) can benefit emotional homeostasis. Recent studies have demonstrated that EE can ameliorate stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Whether hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and corticosteroid receptors are involved in these effects of EE is not known. In our current study, we examined HPA axis activity and hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor/glucocorticoid receptor (MR/GR) mRNA levels following chronic stress in rats. Our study showed that stress reduced body weight, decreased sucrose intake and sucrose preference, and increased immobility in a forced swimming test. These effects were ameliorated by EE. Also we found that 21 days of restraint stress resulted in low HPA axis activity, and a reduction of MR mRNA and MR/GR ratio in the hippocampus of rats, which was restored by EE. Thus, our current results emphasizes the efficiency of EE in the amelioration of stress-induced decrease in the mRNA expression of MR and MR/GR ratio as well as behavioral depression, providing initial evidence for a possible mechanism by which an enriched environment can restore stress-induced deficits.

AB  - In this study, we aimed at comparing the effect of the social versus the physical enrichment of the environment on inflammatory pain. Hence, a rat model of carrageenan-induced knee inflammation was used. Four housing conditions were investigated: a physically enriched environment (PE), a socially enriched environment (SE), an enriched environment (EE) (i.e. physically and socially enriched) and a restricted environment (RE) (i.e. non-physically or socially enriched housing). Mechanical allodynia was assessed using the von Frey test preoperatively and at day post-operative (DPO) 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24 and 28. Besides, anxiety was evaluated at DPO29, using the Elevated Plus-Maze test. Results show that RE housing resulted in a duration of mechanical allodynia of 4 weeks and of only 3 weeks in EE housing. Housing in a physically enriched environment also resulted in a reduction of the duration of mechanical allodynia of I week. Finally, if housed in a SE, the mechanical allodynia lasted for 3 weeks and an half. From these data, we conclude that both physical and social aspects of the environment are involved in the reduction of inflammatory pain duration, although the PE has a larger effect than the SE in this experimental setting. Interestingly, an inter-dependent relationship was noted between the PE and SE. Moreover, no significant difference in the rat anxiety was measured between groups, suggesting that the pain outcomes are likely not biased by the mean of potential housing condition-induced anxiety.

AB  - Migraine is a common headache disorder characterized by unilateral, intense headaches. In migraine with aura, the painful headache is preceded by focal neurological symptoms that can be visual, sensory, or motor in nature. Spreading depression (the most likely cause of migraine with aura and perhaps related headache pain) results in increased neuronal excitability and related increases in inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. This in turn can promote the transformation of low-frequency, episodic migraine into higher-frequency and eventually chronic migraine. Though migraine affects 11% of adults worldwide, with 3% experiencing chronic headache, existing therapies offer only modest benefits. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which environmental enrichment (i.e., volitionally increased intellectual, social, and physical activity) mitigates spreading depression. In prior work, we have shown that exposure to environmental enrichment reduces susceptibility to spreading depression in rats. This protective effect is at least in part due to environmental enrichment-mediated changes in the character of serum exosomes produced by circulating immune cells. We went on to show that environmental enrichment-mimetic exosomes can be produced by stimulating dendritic cells with low levels of interferon gamma (a cytokine that is phasically increased during environmental enrichment). Interferon gamma-stimulated dendritic cell exosomes (IFN gamma-DC-Exos) significantly improve myelination and reduce oxidative stress when applied to hippocampal slice cultures. Here, we propose that they may also be effective against spreading depression. We found that administration of IFN gamma-DC-Exos reduced susceptibility to spreading depression in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that IFN gamma-DC-Exos may be a potential therapeutic for migraine.

AB  - Effects of prenatal environmental enrichment (EE) were examined in Wistar Kyoto (WIN) "depressive-and anxious-like" rats and Wistar rats. During gestation, dams lived in standard cages or in EE cages. Their behavior during gestation and lactation was observed. On weaning day, they were tested in the forced swimming test, and corticosterone concentration was measured from their plasma. The offspring, reared in standard environment, were tested as juveniles or young adults in the elevated plus maze, open field and forced swimming tests. Corticosterone concentration in feces was analyzed. EE offspring showed more anxiety-like behaviors and less activity, compared to controls. Effects were more prominent in youth than in adulthood and in Wistar rats more than in WKY. EE lowered corticosterone concentration in young WKY rats' feces. EE induced changes in the dams' behavior during gestation and lactation. These changes in dams' behavior could be mediators of the effects on the offspring. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An enriched environment has been shown to influence brain plasticity and function by involving the action of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF, which is synthesized as a precursor molecule (proBDNF) that undergoes proteolytic cleavage, plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and contributes to several brain functions such as memory, learning, and behavior. The neurotrophins and proneurotrophins often play opposite roles in the brain, suggesting that proteolytic cleavage of proneurotrophins controls the action of neurotrophins. However, few studies have focused on the expression and cleavage of proBDNF after exposure to an enriched environment. Our study aimed to explore the effects of an early-enriched environment on the conversion of proBDNF to BDNF in the adult rats' hippocampus. We found that there was no difference in the expression of proBDNF in the hippocampus between the SE (standard environment) and EE (enriched environment) rats, but a significantly increased BDNF protein level was found in the EE rats. Thus, a remarkably enhanced ratio of BDNF to proBDNF (BDNF/proBDNF) was observed in the EE rats. In addition, the EE resulted in a remarkably up-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the hippocampus, which played a key role in converting proBDNF to BDNF in the extracellular space. Furthermore, the expression of synapse-related proteins (NR1 and NR2A) was analyzed, and the results indicated that EE could significantly increase the expression of NR1 and NR2A in the hippocampus. In addition, the behavioral results showed that EE reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze test and reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test. Moreover, the EE resulted in an increased preference for sucrose compared to the SE. These results suggested that the EE up-regulated MMP-9 levels within the hippocampus, which might facilitate the conversion of proBDNF to BDNF, thereby contributing to the long lasting alterations of synaptic plasticity and behavior.

AB  - Objective During the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine and staying at home is advised. The social relationship between people has become deficient, and human social isolation (SI) has become the consequence of this situation. It was shown that SI has made changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity, which will lead to poor cognitive function and behavioural abnormalities. There is a connection between SI, learning, and memory impairments. In addition, anxiety-like behaviour and increased aggressive mood in long-term isolation have been revealed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Term searches was done in Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and PubMed databases as well as hand searching in key resource journals from 1979 to 2020. Results Studies have shown that some drug administrations may positively affect or even prevent social isolation consequences in animal models. These drug treatments have included opioid drugs, anti-depressants, Antioxidants, and herbal medications. In addition to drug interventions, there are non-drug treatments that include an enriched environment, regular exercise, and music. Conclusion This manuscript aims to review improved cognitive impairments induced by SI during COVID-19.

AB  - Stress in early life is believed to cause cognitive and affective disorders, and to disrupt hippocampal synaptic plasticity in adolescence into adult, but it is unclear whether exposure to enriched environment (EE) can overcome these effects. Here, we reported that housing rats in cages with limited nesting/bedding materials on postnatal days 2-21 reduced body weight gain, and this type of early life stress impaired spatial learning and memory of the Morris water maze and increased depressive-like behavior of the forced swim test in young adult rats (postnatal days 53-57). Early life stress also impaired long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA I area of slices of young adult rats. Remarkably, EE experience on postnatal days 22-52 had no effect on spatial learning/memory and depressive-like behavior, but it significantly facilitated UP in control rats, and completely overcame the effects of early life stress on young adult rats. These findings suggest that EE experience may be useful for clinical intervention in preventing cognitive and affective disorders during development. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Structural and social factors are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. Since animal models of depression are a major tool to gain insights into the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of this disease it is important not only to exploit but also to be aware of factors that may affect these models. As housing represents a fundamental external factor, which is controversially debated to affect the animals' emotionality, this study aimed to investigate the impact of different social and structural housing conditions on the development of a depressive-like syndrome in the learned helplessness paradigm. Group housing in an impoverished environment led to an increased vulnerability in the learned helplessness paradigm. Groups that were housed enriched, however, were less helpless. Furthermore impoverished conditions did not increase the vulnerability in single housed animals. Regarding emotionality in the animals, basal anxiety was reduced and the exploration was enhanced by group housing and enriched environment. These results suggest that housing conditions significantly influence the outcome of learned helplessness studies. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During prenatal life, exposure to synthetic glucocorticoids (SGCs) can alter normal foetal development, resulting in disease later in life. Previously, we have shown alterations in the dendritic cytoarchitecture of Purkinje cells in adolescent rat progeny prenatally exposed to glucocorticoids. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations remain unclear. A possible molecular candidate whose deregulation may underlie these changes is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurotrophin 3/ tropomyosin receptor kinase C, neurotrophic complex (NT-3/TrkC), which specifically modulates the development of the neuronal connections in the cerebellar vermis. To date, no evidence has shown that the cerebellar expression levels of this neurotrophic complex are affected by exposure to a synthetic glucocorticoid in utero. Therefore, the first objective of this investigation was to evaluate the expression of GR, NT-3 and TrkC in the cerebellar vermis using immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques by evaluating the progeny during the postnatal stage equivalent to adolescence (postnatal Day 52). Additionally, we evaluated anxiety-like behaviours in progeny using the elevated plus maze and the marble burying test. In addition, an environmental enrichment (EE) can increase the expression of some neurotrophins and has anxiolytic power. Therefore, we wanted to assess whether an EE reversed the long-term alterations induced by prenatal betamethasone exposure. The major findings of this study were as follows: i) prenatal betamethasone (BET) administration decreases GR, NT-3 and TrkC expression in the cerebellar vermis ii) prenatal BET administration decreases GR expression in the cerebellar hemispheres and iii) enhances the anxiety-like behaviours in the same progeny, and iv) exposure to an EE reverses the reduced expression of GR, NT-3 and TrkC in the cerebellar vermis and v) decreases anxiety-like behaviours. In conclusion, an enriched environment applied 18 days post-weaning was able to restabilize GR, NT-3 and TrkC expression levels and reverse anxious behaviours observed in adolescent rats prenatally exposed to betamethasone.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of voluntary daily exercise and environmental enrichment on spatial memory and learning as well as motor coordination and learning, in diabetic mice.
   Setting: College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Arabian Gulf University, Bahrain.
   Design: An Experimental Animal Study.
   Method: BALB/C mice (20 g to 25 g) received 55 mg/kg streptozotocin IP daily for five days. Diabetic mice were randomly assigned to one of the following groups for 12 weeks' duration: (1) social isolation; (2) an environmental enrichment; (3) environmental enrichment and voluntary daily exercise. The fourth group consisted of normal controls. At the end of 12 weeks, the mice were assessed by the Morris Water Maze and the Rotarod for cognitive and motor performance respectively.
   Result: All diabetic mice showed hyperglycemia. In water maze testing, exercise and environmental enrichment groups showed better learning as evidenced by reductions in time (escape latency) and distance swum to reach a submerged platform compared to diabetic isolated mice. In diabetic mice, exercise itself did not have a significant additional benefit on learning and memory compared to environmental enrichment alone. In rotarod test, motor learning was impaired with isolation but enhanced with environmental enrichment and exercise.
   Conclusion: Environmental enrichment and exercise confer significant benefits on cognition and motor performance in diabetic mice.

AB  - Adolescence is a period that exhibits both vulnerability and adaptation to environmental stimulus. This study explored the co-existence effect of environmental enrichment (EE) and restraint stress (RS) on innate anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adolescent mice. Male ICR mice were treated with daily EE and RS (4 h/d or 8 h/d) for 2 or 4 weeks from early adolescence (postnatal day 30) and emotional behaviors were evaluated 24 h after the end of treatment. 4 weeks of 8 h RS treatment decreased immobility time in forced swimming test, demonstrating an antidepressant-like effect. For 2 weeks of treatment, 8 h RS significantly reduced the time spent in the lighted compartment of the light-dark box, indicating an increased anxiety level. These results show that under the present experimental design, RS treatment with different duration could have different effect on mice emotion-related behavior, but there was no interaction between EE and RS.

AB  - The rodent has been the preferred research model for evaluating the mechanisms related to, and potential treatments for, traumatic brain injury (TB!). Many therapies previously determined to be effective in preclinical investigations have failed to show the same effectiveness in clinical trials. The environment a rodent is housed in plays an important role in brain and behavioral development. Housing rodents in non-enriched environments significantly alters the development of the rodent brain and its behavioral profile, negatively impacting the ecological validity of the rodent model. This investigation employed 113 male Long-Evans rats assigned to either an enriched environment (EE) or standard environment (SE) from post-natal day 25. At four months of age, rats received either a controlled cortical impact (CCI) to the medial frontal cortex (mFC) or sham injury. Rats assigned to EE or SE pre-injury were re-assigned to remain in, or switch to, EE or SE post-injury. The open-field test (OFT), vermicelli handling test (VHT) Morris water maze (MWM), and rotor-rod (RR), were used to evaluate the animals response to TBI. The data from the current investigation indicates that the performance of TBI rats assigned to pre-injury EE was improved on the MWM compared to the TBI rats assigned to pre-injury SE. However, those that were reared in the EE performed better on the MWM if placed into a SE post-injury as compared to those placed into the EE after insult. The TBI and sham groups that were raised, and remained, in the SE performed worse than any of the EE groups on the RR. TBI rats that were placed in the EE had larger cortices and more cells in the hippocampus than the TBI rats housed in the SE. These data strongly suggest that the pre-injury housing environment should be considered as investigators refine pre-clinical models of TBI. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developmental and social factors are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Although it has been demonstrated that early life aversive experiences can be a risk factor in the development of human depression, most of the investigation in animals that try to model depression do not include postnatal manipulations. Since housing represents a fundamental ethological factor which modifies behavior and brain development, this study aimed to investigate the impact of different social and structural housing conditions on the development of a depressive-like syndrome in the behavioral despair paradigm and an anxiety-like syndrome in the unconditioned anxiety paradigm. The present study uses several multivariate analyses to study the impact of housing conditions in animal models of depression and anxiety. In this study, social isolation was able to reproduce the effects found in other animals models based on stress, suggesting that only 2 months of social isolation are enough to produce effects that can be useful as behavioral model of depression. Moreover, environmental enrichment showed an antidepressive and anxiolytic like effect in animal models of depression and anxiety. This effect, which has not been reported in earlier studies, suggests that stimulation during the first stages of growth might play a "protective" role on behavior and brain development.

AB  - Purpose: Anxiety-like (ANX) and depression-like (DEP) symptoms are common consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Environmental enrichment (EE) attenuates many deficits, though its impact on ANX and DEP symptoms has yet to be described.
   Methods: Adult male Long-Evans rats were subject to a medial frontal cortex (mFC) cortical impact injury or sham preparation, then placed into EE or standard housing (SE). ANX symptoms were analyzed using the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM). The forced swim task (FST) and sucrose consumption task (SCT) were used to quantify DEP symptoms. In order to measure changes in spatial learning and motor performance, the Barnes maze (BM) and rotor rod (RR) were utilized.
   Results: Damage to the mFC resulted in functional losses in motor and cognitive behavior and an increase in ANX and DEP symptoms. Placement of injured rats into the EE improves motor functioning after TBI and resulted in an decreased latency to locate the escape box in the BM. Though the application of an EE attenuated deficits in BM and RR performance, the ANX and DEP behavioral symptoms persisted.
   Conclusions: Additional therapeutic approaches paired with EE may be necessary to address all functional changes post-TBI. Additionally, no single behavioral assessment appears to clearly identify symptoms of ANX or DEP in rats following TBI, however utilizing multiple tests can be potentially confounding.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (E) can change neuronal structure, improves learning in various tasks and increases cerebral plasticity. However, no E effects were found in a test measuring social olfactory discrimination memory and, although they have been mainly measured in mates, gender differences have been reported in other tests. The aims of the present study were to evaluate gender differential effects of E in the social discrimination paradigm which also involves social olfactory discrimination and in the elevated plus-maze test (EPM) for measuring anxiety. E procedure consisted of a combination of social and physical factors; groups of 11-12 Sprague-Dawley rats were separated by sex in large cages with physical stimulus for a period of 8 weeks starting immediately after weaning. Differential gender E effects appeared in the social exploratory patterns: enriched males showed increased exploratory behaviour towards juvenile rats in comparison to control males, whereas no differences were found in females. No effects of E in social discrimination memory were observed. In the EPM, both enriched male and female rats showed less anxious behaviour than non-enriched animals. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previously we showed that pigs reared in an enriched environment had higher baseline salivary cortisol concentrations during the light period than pigs reared under barren conditions. In the present experiment, it was investigated whether these higher baseline salivary cortisol concentrations were a real difference in cortisol concentration or merely represented a phase difference in circadian rhythm. The effects of different cortisol concentrations on the behavioral responses to novelty and learning and long-term memory in a maze test were also studied in enriched and barren housed pigs. At 9 weeks of age enriched and barren housed pigs did not differ in baseline salivary cortisol concentrations nor in circadian rhythm, but at 22 weeks of age barren housed pigs had a blunted circadian rhythm in salivary cortisol as compared to enriched housed pigs. The differences in baseline salivary cortisol concentrations between enriched- and barren-housed pigs are age-dependent, and become visible after 15 weeks of age. Enriched- and barren-housed piglets did not differ in time spent on exploration in the novel environment test. Barren-housed pigs had an impaired long-term memory in the maze test compared to enriched-housed pigs; however, no differences in learning abilities between enriched- and barren-housed pigs were found. Because blunted circadian cortisol rhythms are often recorded during states of chronic stress in pigs and rats or during depression in humans, it is suggested that the blunted circadian rhythm in cortisol in barren-housed pigs similarily may reflect decreased welfare.

AB  - A bibliometric analysis was undertaken to chart the development of animal welfare (AW) science as a whole, and of the individuals, organisations and countries that have had most academic impact to date. Publication data were collected from the Web of Science for the year range 1968-2017 and by-hand pre-processing of the data was undertaken to identify reviews and original research articles on AW. VOSviewer was used to create bibliometric networks. There has been a 13.3% annual growth in AW publications in the last 50 years with Animal Welfare and Applied Animal Behaviour Science the most frequent publishers of AW publications. Farm animals continue to dominate the subject of AW research and comparison of network visualisations for five key species suggested possible gaps in the research, such as relatively little emphasis on emotion research for some farm animals and little research on inherited disorders in dogs. However, keyword analysis indicated a recent broadening of AW findings to include other international contexts, such as conservation and sustainability. Highly cited review articles were grouped into five clusters with affective state (ie emotions, moods) and fish welfare the most recent topics. Almost all core authors of original research articles study farm animals, though in the last ten years other topics, such as consumer attitudes and wildlife, have emerged as highly cited areas of original research articles. Network analysis of organisations revealed the University of Bristol, UK as the main publisher of original research articles. Citation analysis indicated that many low-cited articles were originating from Germany and were published in German journals, suggesting that many worthwhile results and opinions on AW may be being missed by other researchers due to a language barrier. Several limitations of bibliometric analysis to generate an overview of AW science were identified, including the challenge of how to search and extract all the relevant publications in this discipline. In conclusion, animal welfare science is still in an exponential phase of growth which will bring opportunities, such as for the publication of new journals, but also challenges. The insights generated by this study suggest bibliometric analysis to be a useful addition to other approaches investigating the trends and concepts of animal welfare.

AB  - Environmental factors play a key role in the etiology of depression. The rodent forced swim test (FST) is commonly used as a preclinical model of depression, with increases in escape-directed behavior reflecting antidepressant effects, and increases in immobility reflecting behavioral despair. Environmental enrichment leads to serotonergic alterations in rats, but it is unknown whether these alterations may influence the efficacy of common antidepressants. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were reared in enriched (EC), standard (SC), or isolated (IC) conditions. Following the rearing period, fluoxetine (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 23.5 hrs, 5 hrs, and 1 hr before locomotor and FST measures. Following locomotor testing and FST exposure, rats were weighed to assess fluoxetine-, FST-, and environmental condition-induced moderations in weight gain. Results revealed an antidepressant effect of environmental enrichment and a depressant effect of isolation. Regardless of significant fluoxetine effects on locomotor activity, fluoxetine generally decreased swimming and increased immobility in all three environmental conditions, with IC-fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) rats and EC-fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) rats swimming less than vehicle counterparts. Subchronic 20 mg/kg fluoxetine also induced significant weight loss, and differential rearing appeared to moderate weight gain following FST stress. These results suggest that differential rearing has the ability to alter FST behaviors, fluoxetine efficacy, and post-stressor well-being. Moreover, 20 mg/kg fluoxetine, administered subchronically, may lead to atypical effects of those commonly observed in the FST, highlighting the importance and impact of both environmental condition and dosing regimen in common animal models of depression.

AB  - Enriched housing conditions (enriched environment, EE) during development has been shown to Influence adult rat behavior and transmitter systems, especially dopamine function. We were interested in how different degrees of enrichment during development would affect adult rats' behavior and response to dopamine receptor challenge.
   Two groups of male Wistar rats (n=11-12) were raised under two different degrees of EE, Le. "high enriched" and "low enriched" groups. A third group was kept under standard conditions and served as "non-enriched" control. As adults, rats were tested for anxiety (elevated plus-maze), for spatial learning (four-arm-baited eight-arm radial maze), and for motivation (breakpoint of the progressive ratio test). Finally, locomotor activity (activity box) and sensorimotor gating (prepulse Inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR)) were tested with and without challenge with the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine.
   The time spent on the open or enclosed arms of the elevated plus-maze did not differ between groups, but the high enriched group showed higher rearing activity on the open arms. The breakpoint did not differ between groups. Learning and memory in the radial maze task only differed on the first few trials, but high enriched rats run faster compared with the other groups. In contrast, in the activity box enriched groups were less active, but apomorphine had the highest effect. Between groups, no difference In PPI and startle amplitude was found, but in the high and low EE group startle amplitude was enhanced after administration of apomorphine, while the PPI deficit induced by this drug was not different between groups.
   Altogether, we found no evidence that different amounts of environmental enrichment without differences In social EE affect rats' cognitive, emotional or motivational behavior. However, motor activity seems to be enhanced when rats are behaviorally or pharmacologically challenged by dopamine receptor agonists. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Depression in astronauts is one of the consequences of space flight effects, negatively impacting their work performances. Unfortunately, the underlying molecular mechanisms in space flight-induced depression are still unknown; however, various neuropsychiatric disorders reported that overexpressed NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the brain triggers various pathological pathways, and inhibiting NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex asserts antidepressant effects. Through our in silico analysis, we found that epigenetic regulator miR-445-3p targets PSD-95 and is hypothesized to down-regulate NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex to prevent neuronal damage associated with depression. Therefore, the present study is aimed to determine the novel insight of the miR-455-3p against the NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the neurobiology of space flight-induced depressive behavior. Using a simulated space environment complex model (SCSE) for 21 days, we induced depressive behavior in rats to analyze miR-455-3p expression and NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the cortex and hippocampus of the SCSE depressed rats through qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Further, an in vitro microgravity model using rat hippocampus cell lines (RHNC) was utilized to identify the independent role of miR-455-3p on (1) NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex and TrKB-BDNF proteins, (2) oxidative stress, (3) nitric oxide level, (4) inflammatory cytokines, (5) mitochondrial biogenesis/ dynamics, and (6) cell survival. Our results showed that miR-455-3p regulates NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the SCSE depressed rats in opposite ways, with the cortex revealing a higher level of miR-455-3p and low-level NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex and the hippocampus showing down-regulated miR-455-3p and up-regulated NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex, indicating a region-specific change in the miR-455-3p and NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the SCSE depressed rats. Further RHNC results also confirmed down-regulated miR-455-3p and up-regulated NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex expression, similar to the findings in the hippocampus of SCSE rats, suggesting that microgravity influences miR-455-3p and associated changes. Additional investigations revealed that miR-455-3p targets PSD-95 and co-regulates NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex along with TrkB-BDNF signaling and exert protective effects against NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex, oxidative stress, nitric oxide, inflammatory cytokines, and mitochondrial defects, suggesting a valuable biomarker for devising depressive disorders.

AB  - We compared the expression of phenotype of parvalbumin (PV)-immunoreactive cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of juvenile rats reared in enriched environment (EE) after daily intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposure to those reared in standard environment (SE) and investigated the involvement of NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2)-derived oxidative stress in the IH-induced neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral consequences in a juvenile rat model of obstructive sleep apnea. Postnatal day 21 (P21) rats were exposed to IH or room air 8 h daily for 14 consecutive days. After the daily exposure, the rats were raised in SE or EE. In the PFC of P34 rats, we determined the impact (i) of IH exposures on NOX2-derived oxidative stress and PV immunoreactivity, (ii) of pharmacological NOX2 inhibition on IH-induced oxidative stress and PV immunoreactivity, and (iii) of EE on the IH-induced oxidative stress and PV immunoreactivity. Behavioral testing of psychiatric anxiety was carried out consecutively in the open-field test and elevated plus maze at P35 and P36. The results showed IH exposures increased NOX2 expression in the PFC of P34 rats, which was accompanied with elevation of NOX activity and indirect markers of oxidative stress (4-HNE). IH exposures increased 4-HNE immunoreactivity in cortical PV cells, which was accompanied with reduction of PV immunoreactivity. Treatment of IH rats with the antioxidant/NOX inhibitor apocynin prevented the PV cells loss in the PFC and reversed the IH-induced psychiatric anxiety. EE attenuated the NOX2-derived oxidative stress and reversed the PV-immunoreactivity reduction in the PFC induced by IH. Our data suggest that EE might prevent the juvenile hypoxia-induced developmental loss of PV cells in the PFC and attenuate the neurobehavioral alterations through inhibition of NOX2-derived oxidative stress.

AB  - Maternal malnutrition remains one of the major adversities affecting brain development and long-term mental health outcomes, increasing the risk to develop anxiety and depressive disorders. We have previously shown that malnutrition-induced anxiety-like behaviours can be rescued by a social and sensory stimulation (enriched environment) in male mice. Here, we expand these findings to adult female mice and profiled genome-wide ventral hippocampal 5hmC levels related to malnutrition-induced anxiety-like behaviours and their rescue by an enriched environment. This approach revealed 508 differentially hydroxymethylated genes associated with protein malnutrition and that several genes (N = 34) exhibited a restored 5hmC abundance to control levels following exposure to an enriched environment, including genes involved in neuronal functions like dendrite outgrowth, axon guidance, and maintenance of neuronal circuits (e.g. Fltr3, Itsn1, Lman1, Lsamp, Nav, and Ror1) and epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. Hdac9 and Dicer1). Sequence motif predictions indicated that 5hmC may be modulating the binding of transcription factors for several of these transcripts, suggesting a regulatory role for 5hmC in response to perinatal malnutrition and exposure to an enriched environment. Together, these findings establish a role for 5hmC in early-life malnutrition and reveal genes linked to malnutrition-induced anxious behaviours that are mitigated by an enriched environment.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) housing paradigms have long been shown beneficial for brain function involving neural growth and activity, learning and memory capacity, and for developing stress resiliency. The expression of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA2, which is important for synaptic plasticity and memory, is increased with corticosterone (CORI), undermining synaptic plasticity and memory. Thus, we determined the effect of EE and stress on modulating GluA2 expression in Sprague-Dawley male rats. Several markers were evaluated which include: plasma CORT, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), GluA2, and the atypical protein kinase M zeta (PKM zeta). For 1 week standard-(ST) or FE-housed animals were treated with one of the following four conditions: (1) no stress; (2) acute stress (forced swim test, FST; on day 7); (3) chronic restraint stress (6 h/day for 7 days); and (4) chronic + acute stress (restraint stress 6 h/day for 7 days + FST on day 7). Hippocampi were collected on day 7. Our results show that FE animals had reduced time immobile on the FST across all conditions. After chronic + acute stress EE animals showed increased GR levels with no change in synaptic GluA2/PKM zeta. ST-housed animals showed the reverse pattern with decreased GR levels and a significant increase in synaptic GluA2/PKM zeta. These results suggest that EE produces an adaptive response to chronic stress allowing for increased GR levels, which lowers neuronal excitability reducing GluA2/PKM zeta trafficking. We discuss this EE adaptive response to stress as a potential underlying mechanism that is protective for retaining synaptic plasticity and memory function.

AB  - Innate behaviors are shaped by contingencies built during evolutionary history. On the other hand, environmental stimuli play a significant role in shaping behavior. In particular, a short period of environmental enrichment can enhance cognitive behavior, modify effects of stress on learned behaviors and induce brain plasticity. It is unclear if modulation by environment can extend to innate behaviors which are preserved by intense selection pressure. In the present report we investigate this issue by studying effects of relatively short (14-days) environmental enrichment on two prominent innate behaviors in rats, avoidance of predator odors and ability of males to attract mates. We show that enrichment has strong effects on both the innate behaviors: a) enriched males were more avoidant of a predator odor than non-enriched controls, and had a greater rise in corticosterone levels in response to the odor; and b) had higher testosterone levels and were more attractive to females. Additionally, we demonstrate decrease in dendritic length of neurons of ventrolateral nucleus of hypothalamus, important for reproductive mate-choice and increase in the same in dorsomedial nucleus, important for defensive behavior. Thus, behavioral and hormonal observations provide evidence that a short period of environmental manipulation can alter innate behaviors, providing a good example of gene-environment interaction.

AB  - Glia are starting to be accepted as the equal of neurons. Glia's role in stress and disease as well as the latest glial modulators are reviewed. Environmental enrichment and exercise can increase intelligence, a buffer against stress, most likely via glial involvement. Cerebral dominance is also related to how glia respond to stress resulting in psychiatric illness. Glial effects on depression and schizophrenia are reviewed. Astrocytes, microglia, NG2 cells, and oligodendrocytes all contribute. Suicidal ideation can increase the permeability of the BBB resulting in the increase in serum levels of a glial protein S100B that has become a marker for the intensity of suicidal risk. Microglia form one of the bases of the inflammatory theory of psychiatric disorders. Minocycline, adenosine and cAMP inhibitors, such as PDE-4 inhibitors, have been used to modulate the microglia, with positive results in psychiatric illness. Controlling the microglia can even be protective against drug abuse. Recently a "glymphatic" system has been discovered in mice that if applicable to humans means that we clean out our brains in sleep.

AB  - Environmental enrichment in zebrafish generally reduces anxiety-related behaviours, improves learning in maze trials and increases health and biological fitness. However, certain types of enrichment or certain conditions induce the opposite effects. Therefore, it is essential to study the characteristics of environmental enrichment that modulate these effects. This study aims to investigate if structural environmental enrichment and the way it is offered influence cognitive judgement bias and anxiety-like behaviours in adult zebrafish. The fish were assigned to six housing manipulations: constant barren, constant enrichment, gradual gain of enrichment, gradual loss of enrichment, sudden gain of enrichment and sudden loss of enrichment. We then transposed the cognitive judgment bias paradigm, formerly used in studies on other animals to measure the link between emotion and cognition, to objectively assess the impact of these manipulations on the zebrafish's interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, considering previous experiences and related emotional states. We used two battery tests (light/dark and activity tests), which measured anxiety-related behaviours to check if these tests covariate with cognitive bias results. The fish with a sudden gain in enrichment showed a pessimistic bias (interpreted ambiguous stimuli as negative). In addition, the fish that experienced a sudden gain and a gradual loss in enrichment showed more anxiety-like behaviours than the fish that experienced constant conditions or a gradual gain in enrichment. The data provide some proof that structural environmental enrichment and the way it is presented can alter zebrafish's cognitive bias and anxiety-like behaviours.

AB  - The influence of different housing conditions (standard living in groups, social isolation and enriched environment) at the age from 1.5 to 3.5 months on anxious and depressive -like behavior of adult rats after early proinflammatory stress was studied. On 3rd and 5th day of postnatal life one group of pups received a subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (50 mkg/kg, LPS group) and another group received an injection of saline (Saline group, controls). The testing at the age of 3-3.5 months in an open field and elevated plus maze showed that the housing in social isolation compared to the standard conditions of living led to increase of anxiety in rats, risk assessment behavior (stretch attend postures) and some decline in locomotor and investigatory activity. The most pronounced changes after social isolation occurred in rats of the LPS group. Housing in the enriched environment in rats of the Saline group did not affect a level of anxiety, but could elicit a weak increase of motor and search activity and a risk assessment behavior (hanging). The females of the LPS group showed a non-adequate reaction in the open field an increase of anxious behavior. A sucrose preference test revealed the signs of depressive-like behavior in females of the LPS group after social isolation and enriched environment. Housing in the social isolation produced the most increase in the blood corticosterone level in response to additional stress. Thus, the early proinflammatory stress increased the reactivity to negative stressed impacts in adulthood, wherein the females were the most vulnerable.

AB  - We previously identified in laboratory mice an inactive state [being awake with eyes open motionless within the home cage; inactive but awake, 'IBA'] sharing etiological factors and symptoms with human clinical depression. We further test the hypothesis that greater time spent displaying IBA indicates a depression-like state in mice by investigating whether the antidepressant Venlafaxine, environmental enrichment, and their combination, alleviate IBA. Seventy-two C57BL/6J and 72 DBA/2J female mice were pseudo-randomly housed post-weaning in mixed strain-pairs in non-enriched (NE; 48 pairs) or in environmentally enriched (EE; 24 pairs) cages. After 34 days, half of the mice housed in NE cages were either relocated to EE cages or left in NE cages. For each of these conditions, half of the mice drank either a placebo or the antidepressant Venlafaxine (10 mg/kg). The 48 mice housed in EE cages were all relocated to NE cages and allocated to either the placebo (n = 24) or Venlafaxine (n = 24). IBA data were collected prior to and after environmental adjustment by trained observers blind to the pharmacological and environmental adjustment treatments. Data were analyzed using GLM models. NE cages triggered more IBA than EE cages (Likelihood-Ratio-Test Chi(3)(2) = 53.501, p < 0.0001). Venlafaxine and environmental enrichment appeared equally effective at reducing IBA (LRT Chi(3)(2) = 18.262, p < 0.001), and combining these approaches did not magnify their effects. Enrichment removal triggered IBA increase (LRT Chi(1)(2) = 23.050, p < 0.001), but Venlafaxine did not overcome the increase in IBA resulting from enrichment loss (LTR Chi(1)(2) = 0.081, p = 0.775). Theoretical implications for putative depression-like states in mice, and further research directions, are discussed.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is known to have an anxiolytic effect in several animal models; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these behavioral changes are not understood. In this study, we have shown that the anxiolytic effect of EE is associated with alterations in the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRFR1) expression levels in the limbic system. We found that the decrease in anxiety-like behavior after housing in enriched conditions was associated with very low levels of CRFR1 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala of C57BL/6 mice. We further showed using a lentiviral-based system of RNA interference, that knockdown of CRFR1 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala induces a significant decrease in anxiety levels, similar to those achieved by EE nurture. Our data strongly suggest that reduced expression of CRFR1 mRNA levels in the basolateral amygdala mediates the effect of EE on anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - The provision of environmental enrichment (EE) for laboratory rats is recommended in European guidelines governing laboratory animal welfare. It is believed the EE implementation can improve animals' well-being and EE has been used to demonstrate learning and plasticity of the brain in response to the environment. This review suggests that the definition and duration of EE varies considerably across laboratories. Notwithstanding this, some EE protocols have revealed profound effects on brain neurochemistry and resulting behaviour, suggesting that EE can have the potential to significantly modify these parameters in rats. For this review, a literature search was conducted using PubMed and the search terms "Environmental Enrichment" and "rats". From the results of this search the most important variables for consideration in the implementation of EE are identified and summarised, and include cage size and housing density; rat age, sex and strain; duration of EE; the EE protocol and enrichment items employed; and the use of appropriate controls. The effects of EE in a number of behavioural tests and its effects on neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, stress hormones and neurogenesis and proliferation are outlined. The findings summarised in the present review show the range of EE protocols employed and their effects in tests of activity, learning and affect, as well neurochemical effects which mediate enhanced plasticity in the brain. EE, as is provided in many laboratories, may be of benefit to the animals, however it is important that future work aims to provide a better understanding of EE effects on research outcomes.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to determine the efficacy and possible economic benefits of using environmental enrichment devices (EED) to alter the behavior of two White Leghorn strains in laying cages. The first experiment compared using EEDs with beak-trimmed (BT) and non-break-trimmed (non-BT) birds; the second experiment compared three different cage densities and and without EEDs. The devices failed to show significant effects within experiments, but when the two experiments were combined eliminating the non-BT and seven birds per cage treatments, a significant (P=.013) improvement in economic returns was observed.
   BT resulted in depressed performance in the early stages of production, but subsequent economic results favored the BT treatment. Egg production in the BT birds improved, and they displayed 5.2% lower feed consumption over the entire experiment. Overall profitability of the two treatments was equal, but the BT birds had a $0.13/bird higher flock index than the controls during the last 12 wk of the experiment.
   Most measures of performance except egg weight and feed consumption were adversely affected by increasing the number of birds per cage. Economic returns favored five and six birds per cage over seven bird per cage.

First published June 20, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.01045.2011.-While a substantial literature demonstrates the effect of differential experience on development of mammalian sensory cortices and plasticity of adult motor cortex, characterization of differential experience on the functional development of motor cortex is meager. We first determined when forelimb movement representations (motor maps) could be detected in rats during postnatal development and then whether their motor map expression could be altered with rearing in an enriched environment consisting of group housing and novel toys or skilled learning by training on the single pellet reaching task. All offspring had high-resolution intracortical microstimulation (ICMS)-derived motor maps using methodologies previously optimized for the adult rat. First, cortical GABA-mediated inhibition was depressed by bicuculline infusion directly into layer V of motor cortex and ICMS-responsive points were first reliably detected on postnatal day (PND) 13. Without relying on bicuculline disinhibition of cortex, motor maps emerged on PND 35 and then increased in size until PND 60 and had progressively lower movement thresholds. Second, environmental enrichment did not affect initial detection of responsive points and motor maps in non-bicuculline-treated pups on PND 35. However, motor maps were larger on PND 45 in enriched rat pups relative to pups in the standard housing condition. Rats in both conditions had similar map sizes on PNDs 60, 75, and 90. Third, reach training in rat pups resulted in an internal reorganization of the map in the hemisphere contralateral, but not ipsilateral, to the trained forelimb. The map reorganization was expressed as proportionately more distal (digit and wrist) representations on PND 45. Our data indicate that both environmental enrichment and skilled reach training experience can differentially modify expression of motor maps during development.

AB  - Simple Summary It is well recognized that companionship is important to animals and that they need to be provided with an environment accompanied by materials for enrichment, such as toys. However, few studies have evaluated whether specific environments actually benefit animals. Therefore, we designed various environments for laboratory animals and scientifically evaluated which environments reduced these animals' stress. We found that an environment with freer air circulation and the provision of enrichment materials reduced animal stress, and no risk or benefit could be determined for the presence or absence of a companion. We do not consider that our results necessarily indicate the lack of a need for a companion, but, rather, the importance of having a good companion. Our results can serve as a meaningful guideline for the creation of suitable environments for laboratory animals. Animal welfare is recognized as essential for the coexistence of humans and animals. Considering the increased demand and interest in animal welfare, many methods for improving animal welfare are being devised, but which method reduces animal stress has not been scientifically verified. Therefore, reducing animal stress by providing a proper breeding environment and environmental enrichment can be the basis for animal study. In this study, stress levels were assessed based on the mouse-breeding environment. We considered that the higher the body weight and the lower the corticosterone concentration, the lower the stress. According to the results, animals in the individual ventilation cages were determined to have lower serum cortisol concentrations, while the body weight of the animals was increased when in individual ventilation cages compared with individual isolated cages and when providing environmental enrichment compared with group breeding or not providing environmental enrichment. The results provide appropriate guidelines for improving laboratory animal welfare.

AB  - Environmental enrichment for animals is a combination of complex inanimate and social stimulation and generally consists of housing conditions that facilitate enhanced sensory, cognitive, motor and social stimulation relative to standard housing conditions. One of the most robust effects of environmental enrichment is the reduction of anxiety levels. However, the extreme variability in enrichment protocols may account for some of the inconsistencies in its effects and the variance among results reported by different laboratories. In this protocol, we describe a simple environmental enrichment strategy for the induction of a robust and replicable anxiolytic-like effect in mice. We provide detailed instructions on how to build an enrichment cage that is specially designed for easy manipulation, cleaning and observation by the experimenter. In addition, we describe the different enrichment items, their order in the cage, the frequency of renewal and their cleaning and sterilization procedures. The total length of the protocol is 6 weeks.

AB  - The hippocampus is involved in both cognitive and emotional processing; these different functions are topographically distributed along its septo-temporal axis, the dorsal (septal) hippocampus being preferentially involved in cognitive processes such as learning and memory while the ventral (temporal) hippocampus participates in emotional regulation and anxiety-related behaviors. Newborn hippocampal neurons become functionally integrated into hippocampal networks and are likely to contribute to hippocampal functions, but whether their regulation and function are homogenous throughout this axis is not clear. Here we investigate changes in cell proliferation and neurogenesis along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus induced by the Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress model of depression (UCMS), chronic fluoxetine treatment and enriched environment.
   Mice were either subjected to UCMS, standard housing or enriched environment. Stress-exposed mice were treated daily with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. Effects of UCMS regimen, fluoxetine treatment and enrichment were assessed by physical measures and behavioral testing. Quantitative changes in cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed by immunohistochemistry using BrdU labeling.
   Results indicate that UCMS decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis preferentially in the ventral hippocampus, an effect that was reversed by fluoxetine treatment. Environmental enrichment on the other hand increased cell proliferation in both divisions but promoted neurogenesis only in the dorsal hippocampus. These results indicate that environmental factors can differentially regulate neurogenesis in a region-specific manner. This may possibly underlie heterogeneous function of newborn neurons along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus and have functional significance as to their implication in stress related disorders and memory processes.

AB  - The contributions of genetic risk factors to susceptibility for brain disorders are often so closely intertwined with environmental factors that studying genes in isolation cannot provide the full picture of pathogenesis. With recent advances in our understanding of psychiatric genetics and environmental modifiers we are now in a position to develop more accurate animal models of psychiatric disorders which exemplify the complex interaction of genes and environment. Here, we consider some of the insights that have emerged from studying the relationship between defined genetic alterations and environmental factors in rodent models. A key issue in such animal models is the optimization of construct validity, at both genetic and environmental levels. Standard housing of laboratory mice and rats generally includes ad libitum food access and limited opportunity for physical exercise, leading to metabolic dysfunction under control conditions, and thus reducing validity of animal models with respect to clinical populations. A related issue, of specific relevance to neuroscientists, is that most standard-housed rodents have limited opportunity for sensory and cognitive stimulation, which in turn provides reduced incentive for complex motor activity. Decades of research using environmental enrichment has demonstrated beneficial effects on brain and behavior in both wild-type and genetically modified rodent models, relative to standard-housed littermate controls. One interpretation of such studies is that environmentally enriched animals more closely approximate average human levels of cognitive and sensorimotor stimulation, whereas the standard housing currently used in most laboratories models a more sedentary state of reduced mental and physical activity and abnormal stress levels. The use of such standard housing as a single environmental variable may limit the capacity for preclinical models to translate into successful clinical trials. Therefore, there is a need to optimize 'environmental construct validity' in animal models, while maintaining comparability between laboratories, so as to ensure optimal scientific and medical outcomes. Utilizing more sophisticated models to elucidate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors will allow for improved construct, face and predictive validity, thus facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Animal models of fear and anxiety provide important insight into anxiety-related symptoms in humans. Environmental physical conditions and social contact influence behavior and brain plasticity particularly at early developmental stages and have long lasting effects reaching even adulthood. The potential benefit that a later environmental enrichment may have on rats raised in isolation is however not fully understood. We aim to investigate the effects of housing conditions and their reversion on anxiety and fear-related behaviors in rats. In phase I, we compared the effects of different housing conditions (environmental enrichment, control and social isolation) on anxiety behaviors in the open field test, elevated plus maze and fear conditioning. We found stronger effects of housing on behavioral tests when induced at weaning (phase I), than later in development (phase II). After one month, EE rats showed lower anxiety related behaviors and more freezing in FC. In phase II, we evaluated the effects of the reversion of housing conditions on the same behavioral parameters. We observed a behavioral trend such that the groups started to behave similar to their new housing conditions in OFT mainly. These results suggest that housing conditions at weaning can have long-lasting effects on anxiety and fear-related behaviors. Because the behavioral changes observed after the housing reversal in adulthood were partial, we suggest that more time of social and physical enrichment could be necessary to promote major changes in behavior at this age.

AB  - Life-threatening experiences can result in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. We have developed an animal model for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using a shuttle box in rats. In this paradigm, the rats were exposed to inescapable foot-shock stress (IS) in a shuttle box, and then an avoidance/escape task was performed in the same box 2 weeks after IS. A previous study using this paradigm revealed that environmental enrichment (EE) ameliorated avoidance/numbing-like behaviors, but not hyperarousal-like behaviors, and EE also elevated hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. However, the differential effects of EE components, i.e., running wheel (RW) or toy rotation, on PTSD-like behaviors has remained unclear. In this experiment, we demonstrated that RW, toy rotation, and EE (containing RW and toy rotation) ameliorated avoidance/numbing-like behaviors, induced learning of avoidance responses, and improved depressive-like behaviors in traumatized rats. The RW increased the hippocampal mRNA expression of neurotrophic factors, especially BDNF and glialcell derived neurotrophic factor. Toy rotation influenced FK506 binding protein 5 mRNA expression, which is believed to be a regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis system, in the hippo campus and amygdala. This is the first report to elucidate the differential mechanistic effects of RW and toy rotation. The former appears to exert its effects via neurotrophic factors, while the latter exerts its effects via the HPA axis. Further studies will lead to a better understanding of the influence of environmental factors on PTSD. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is well known that adult neurogenesis occurs in two distinct regions, the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone along the walls of the lateral ventricles. Until now, the contribution of these newly born neurons to behavior and cognition is still uncertain. The current study tested the functional impacts of diminished hippocampal neurogenesis on emotional and cognitive functions in transgenic Gfap-tk mice. Our results showed that anxiety-related behavior evaluated both in the elevated plus maze as well as in the open field, social interaction in the sociability test, and spatial working memory in the spontaneous alternation test were not affected. On the other hand, recognition and emotional memory in the object recognition test and contextual fear conditioning, and hippocampal long-term potentiation were impaired in transgenic mice. Furthermore, we evaluated whether environmental enrichment together with physical exercise could improve or even restore the level of adult neurogenesis, as well as the behavioral functions. Our results clearly demonstrated that environmental enrichment together with physical exercise successfully elevated the overall number of progenitor cells and young neurons in the dentate gyrus of transgenic mice. Furthermore, it led to a significant improvement in object recognition memory and contextual fear conditioning, and reverted impairments in hippocampal long-term potentiation. Thus, our results confirm the importance of adult neurogenesis for learning and memory processes and for hippocampal circuitry in general. Environmental enrichment and physical exercise beneficially influenced adult neurogenesis after it had been disrupted and most importantly recovered cognitive functions and long-term potentiation.

AB  - Although psycho-social stress is a well-known factor that contributes to the development of cancer, it remains largely unclear whether and how environmental eustress influences malignant diseases and regulates cancer-related therapeutic responses. Using an established eustress model, we demonstrate that mice living in an enriched environment (EE) are protected from carcinogen-induced liver neoplasia and transplantable syngeneic liver tumors, owning to a CD8(+) T cell-dependent tumor control. We identify a peripheral Neuro-Endocrine-Immune pathway in eustress, including Sympathetic nervous system (SNS)/beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs)/CCL2 that relieves tumor immunosuppression and overcomes PD-L1 resistance to immunotherapy. Notably, EE activates peripheral SNS and beta-ARs signaling in tumor cells and tumor infiltrated myeloid cells, leading to suppression of CCL2 expression and activation of anti-tumor immunity. Either blockade of CCL2/CCR2 or beta-AR signaling in EE mice lose the tumor protection capability. Our study reveales that environmental eustress via EE stimulates anti-tumor immunity, resulting in more efficient tumor control and a better outcome of immunotherapy.
   The impact of positive environment stimulations (eustress) on cancer biology remains poorly understood. Here the authors show that exposure to an environment enrichment stimulates anti-tumor immunity and reduces tumor growth in preclinical models of liver cancer.

AB  - The serotonin transporter (5-HTT in humans, SERT in rodents) is the main regulator of serotonergic transmission in the brain. The short allelic variant of the 5-HTT gene is in humans associated with psychopathologies and may enhance the vulnerability to develop depression after exposure to stressful events. Interestingly, the short allele also increases the sensitivity to a positive environment, which may buffer the vulnerability to depression. Since this polymorphism does not exist in rodents, male SERT knockout (SERT-/-) rats were tested to explore the molecular mechanisms based on this increased predisposition. This article investigates the influences of a positive manipulation, namely, enriched environment (EE), on the depressive-like behavior observed in SERT-/- rats. We found that one month of EE exposure normalized the anhedonic and anxious-like phenotype characteristics of this animal model. Moreover, we observed that EE exposure also restored the molecular alterations in the prefrontal cortex by positively modulating the expression of the neurotrophin Bdnf, and of spines and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic markers. Overall, our data confirm the depression-like phenotype of SERT-/- rats and highlight the ability of EE to restore behavioral and molecular alterations, thus promoting the opportunity to use EE as a supporting non-pharmacological approach to treat mood disorders.

AB  - Dextromethorphan (DXM) is an effective over-the-counter antitussive with an alarming increase as an abused drug for recreational purposes. Although reports of the association between DXM administration and anxiety, there are few investigations into the underlying DMX mechanisms of anxiogenic action. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) in DXMinduced anxiety/exploratory-related behaviors in adult male Wistar rats. Animals were bilaterally cannulated in the MD regions. After one week, anxiety and exploratory behaviors were measured using an elevated plusmaze task (EPM) and a hole-board apparatus. Results showed that DXM (3-7 mg/kg, i. p.) dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behaviors. Intra-MD administration of ACPA (2.5-10 ng/rat), a selective CB1 receptor agonist, decreased anxiety-like effects of DXM. The blockade of MD CB1 receptors by AM-251 (40-120 ng/rat) did not affect the EPM task. However, it potentiated the anxiogenic response of an ineffective dose of DXM (3 mg/kg) in the animals. Moreover, the effect of post-weaning treadmill exercise (TEX) and enriched environment (EE) were examined in adulthood anxiety under the drug treatments. Juvenile rats were divided into TEX/EE and control groups. The TEX/EE-juvenile rats were placed on a treadmill and then exposed to EE for five weeks. Interestingly, compared to untreated animals, post-weaning TEX/EE inhibited the anxiety induced by DXM or AM-251/DXM. It can be concluded that the MD endocannabinoid system plays an essential role in the anxiogenic effect of dextromethorphan. Moreover, post-weaning exercise alongside an enriched environment may have an inhibitory effect on adulthood anxiety-like behaviors.

AB  - Behavioural experience (e.g. chronic stress, environmental enrichment) can have long-lasting effects on cognitive functions. Because activity-dependent persistent changes in synaptic strength are believed to mediate memory processes in brain areas such as hippocampus, we tested whether behaviour has also long-lasting effects on synaptic plasticity by examining the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in slices of hippocampal CA1 obtained from rats either 7-9 months after social defeat (behavioural stress) or 3-5 weeks after 5-week exposure to environmental enrichment. Compared with age-matched controls, defeated rats showed markedly reduced LTP. LTP was even completely impaired but LTD was enhanced in defeated and, subsequently, individually housed (during the 7-9-month period after defeat) rats. However, increasing stimulus intensity during 100-Hz stimulation resulted in significant LTP. This suggests that the threshold for LTP induction is still raised and that for LTD lowered several months after a short stressful experience. Both LTD and LTP were enhanced in environmentally enriched rats, 3-5 weeks after enrichment, as compared with age-matched controls. Because enrichment reduced paired-pulse facilitation, an increase in presynaptic release, facilitating both LTD and LTP induction, might contribute to enhanced synaptic changes. Consistently, enrichment reduced the number of 100-Hz stimuli required for inducing LTP. But enrichment may also actually enhance the range of synaptic modification. Repeated LTP and LTD induction produced larger synaptic changes in enriched than in control rats. These data reveal that exposure to very different behavioural experiences can produce long-lasting effects on the susceptibility to synaptic plasticity, involving pre- and postsynaptic processes.

AB  - Undesirable and problematic behaviors such as an increase in aggressiveness and attempts to escape are frequently provoked when a pet dog is maintained for long periods in stressful environments such as veterinary clinics or shelters. Environmental enrichment and petting are strategies to increase dogs' welfare. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate which of these techniques is better at improving dogs' welfare in a unique veterinary clinic setting based on the dogs' behavioral responses. Eight dogs were studied, with 4 receiving environmental enrichment and 4 receiving petting (direct human contact). Behaviors were recorded before, during, and after applications. These conditions were compared using generalized linear mixed models and Friedman's test. Both methods proved to be efficient and feasible for dogs in this type of setting. In general, environmental enrichment increased the activity of the dogs, since they walked and dug more compared to dogs who were petted. Dogs exhibited more positive social interactions after petting. The other behaviors were exhibited in the same proportion in both treatments. Thus, both interventions may be used to decrease anxiety and undesirable behaviors related to a sheltered environment and should be tested in a standard veterinary clinic environment.

AB  - Several researchers have observed that environmental enrichment (EE) can be effective in reducing stressful conditions and abnormal behavior and may provide better reproductive performance in rodents. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the reproductive performance of Wistar rats reared in three different housing conditions. Animals were separated into breeding pairs, one pair per cage and pairs randomly assigned to three experimental groups (ten couples per group): control group were provided cages without any environmental enrichment; PVC group with PVC pipe; and cardboard roll group with a commercially available cardboard tube. To compare the reproductive performance of the three groups, the following were evaluated: number of pups/litter; number of litters; parturition interval; occurrence of cannibalism; weight gain of offspring; as well as the quantity and quality of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) obtained after superovulation of the females born from the first, second and last pregnancy in all groups. Moreover, the plasma level of corticosterone in breeding animals was measured. A total of 60 male rats randomly selected from the first- and last-born litters (20 males from each group) were first tested in an elevated plus-maze (EPM) and on the following day, were tested in an open field test (OFT). Significant differences were found in the number and morphological classification of COCs. In the control group, the number of oocytes in grade 4 (unusual shapes and very heterogeneous ooplasm, presenting no layers of surrounding cumulus cells [13]) presented statistically higher rates (225/2535, 8.9%) compared to the other groups, as well as the number of competent oocytes was higher in the enriched groups (p = 0.001). Moreover, we find that the males of cardboard roll group differed significantly in weight gain compared to PVC group (p = 0.008). In addition to this, we did not detect occurrence of cannibalism in this group. Our findings suggest that environmental enrichment provides improvements in reproductive performance of Wistar rats.

AB  - Simple Summary Alternative cage-free housing systems for growing rabbits, such as parks/elevated pens, are currently being developed in Mediterranean countries. In these parks, the inability to express gnawing behavior and fear are the top behavioral-welfare-associated consequences. Gnawing inability promotes abnormal stereotypical and aggressive behaviors. Fear can be reduced by avoiding aggression. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of gnawing compressed hay blocks and sex-group composition (only females, only males, mixed sex) on the productive results, behavior, and reactivity of growing rabbits in a park system. None of the animals showed injuries due to aggression at the end of the trial. The provision of gnawing blocks affected rabbit behavior negligibly but improved their reactivity towards a new environment or a new object; thus, the inclusion of gnawing blocks should be recommended for animal welfare. Changes in sex-group composition were not relevant in terms of either quantity or quality of performance and conspecific interactions. To improve animal welfare in collective park housing systems, this study assessed the effects of the provision of gnawing hay blocks and the group composition (F: females, M: males, FM: mixed sex) on performance, behavior, and reactivity of 288 growing rabbits reared in 18 parks (16 rabbits/park) from 31 to 73 days of age. The presence of gnawing blocks inside the feeding area of the parks scarcely affected performance and budget time, but decreased the time spent in the resting area compared to parks without blocks (p < 0.001); it increased the time spent moving during the open field test (p < 0.05) and the rate of rabbits that approached the object in the novel-object test (p < 0.05). As for sex-group composition, the feed conversion ratio was lower in parks F and FM than in park M (p < 0.05). During the open-field test, FM rabbits spent more time moving (p < 0.05), whereas M rabbits displayed self-grooming for a longer time (p < 0.01). Results related to production, behavior, and reactivity indicate the provision of gnawing blocks for welfare improvement, but do not support the change from current mixed-sex to single-sex rearing.

AB  - Health consequences of relative or absolute poverty constitute a definitive area of study in social medicine. As demonstrated in the extreme example of the Dutch Hunger Winter from 1944 to 1945, prenatal hunger can lead to adult schizophrenia and depression. A Norwegian study showed how childhood poverty resulted in a heightened risk of myocardial infarction in adulthood. In England, a study of extended impaired prenatal nutrition indicated three different types of increased cardiovascular risk at older ages. Current animal and human studies link both adverse and enriched environmental exposures to intergenerational transmission. We do not fully understand the molecular mechanisms for it; however, studies that follow up epigenetic marks within a generation combined with exploration of gametic epigenetic inheritance may help explain the prevalence of certain conditions such as cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia, and alcoholism, which have complex etiologies. Insights from these studies will be of great public health importance.

AB  - When introducing environmental enrichment in laboratory animals, positive and/or negative effects on behavioural and physiological parameters should be evaluated. This three-step randomised controlled trial in male C57BL/6 mice investigated the effect of supplementing the environment with one or more hemp ropes. In part 1, the effect of a hemp rope on aggressive and social behaviour, stress and anxiety levels was assessed by social interaction test, elevated plus maze behaviour, and faecal corticosterone metabolites, respectively (n = 224 mice). In part 2, the effect of 1, 2 or 7 hemp ropes on aggressive behaviour in mice subjected to routine handling was evaluated by assessing the number of wounded companion animals and wounds per animal (n = 224). In part 3, climbing activity in the rope and amount of material shredded from the rope was assessed (n = 56). Mice housed with one hemp rope engaged in social behaviour for longer time than mice housed without a hemp rope, while no difference was detected in stress and anxiety levels. No difference was seen in the number of wounded animals or wounds per animal when adding 1, 2 or 7 hemp ropes to the existing environment in mice undergoing minimal human handling. The mice continuously shredded and climbed the rope, even when provided with a new rope, although time spent climbing decreased slightly over time. Thus, a hemp rope can be used as additional environmental enrichment amongst male C57BL/6 mice.

AB  - Environmental enrichment produces protective addiction and depression phenotypes in rats. Delta FosB is a transcription factor that regulates reward in the brain and is induced by psychological stress as well as drugs of abuse. However, the role played by Delta FosB in the protective phenotypes of environmental enrichment has not been well studied. Here, we demonstrate that Delta FosB is differentially regulated in rats reared in an isolated condition (IC) compared to those in an enriched condition (EC) in response to restraint stress or cocaine. Chronic stress or chronic cocaine treatment each elevates Delta FosB protein levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of IC rats, but not of EC rats due to an already elevated basal accumulation of Delta FosB seen under EC conditions. Viral-mediated overexpression of Delta FosB in the NAc shell of pair-housed rats (i.e., independent of environmental enrichment/isolation) increases operant responding for sucrose when motivated by hunger, but decreases responding in satiated animals. Moreover, Delta FosB overexpression decreases cocaine self administration, enhances extinction of cocaine seeking, and decreases cocaine-induced reinstatement of intravenous cocaine self-administration; all behavioral findings consistent with the enrichment phenotype. In contrast, however, Delta FosB overexpression did not alter responses of pair-housed rats in several tests of anxiety- and depression related behavior. Thus, Delta FosB in the NAc the shell mimics the protective addiction phenotype, but not the protective depression phenotype of environmental enrichment.

AB  - In rats, exploratory activity and emotional reactivity towards novel stimuli reflect independent biological functions that are modulated differently by rearing experiences. Environmental enrichment is known to improve performance in exploratory tasks, while having inconsistent effects on emotionality. This study examined the effect of environmental enrichment on the behaviour of rats in two exploratory tasks. Male rats were reared under one of four conditions, differing in social and non-social complexity. At 9 weeks of age, exploration of a novel open field, and exploration of novel objects in the same open field following 24 h habituation, was assessed. Differences in social and non-social complexity of the rearing environment had inconsistent effects on exploration in the novel open field. In contrast, when rats were faced with novel objects in an otherwise familiar environment, exploration habituated faster with increasing stimulus complexity of the non-social environment. The social environment had no effect on this latter test. These findings indicate that environmental enrichment affects exploratory activity primarily through its effect on habituation to novelty. This effect depends on relative stimulus complexity of the rearing environment, but is independent of social factors. The present results further suggest that aversive tasks can obscure the expression of enrichment-dependent differences in habituation to novelty. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Piglets in commercial husbandry are weaned abruptly and at a rather young age. Many weanling piglets are poorly adapted to ingest solid food, often resulting in a period of underfeeding. The underfeeding generally leads to a poor growth, diarrhoea occurrence and the development of damaging behaviours such as belly nosing, indicating reduced welfare, in the immediate postweaning period. Weaning problems are multifactorial, but an early intake of solid food and reduced stress around weaning are major determinants of a quick adaptation of piglets to the new postweaning situation. In this paper we focus on improving welfare of piglets around weaning by allowing piglets to interact more with the sow during lactation, as would occur under more natural conditions. Besides providing piglets with more opportunity to learn from the sow about what, how and where to eat, we also discuss information transfer already before birth, perinatal flavour learning, and the merits of learning in an enriched environment.
   Being able to interact more with the sow is important to reduce the reluctance of piglets to eat novel foods, to increase preweaning solid food intake, and to reduce the development of damaging behaviours and increase play behaviour after weaning. Perinatal flavour learning reduced stress around weaning and increased postweaning performance and welfare. Preweaning enrichment of the environment, by providing substrates and a larger pen, can increase preweaning growth and development of feeding-related behaviours before weaning as well as food intake after weaning. Postweaning enrichment increased growth and play behaviour, and reduced the occurrence of diarrhoea and damaging behaviours. When enrichment is provided before weaning it is important to also provide enrichment after weaning. Learning from the sow and environmental enrichment are important for piglets to more easily adapt to being weaned. We conclude with recommendations for application of these results in current and future pig husbandry systems to improve welfare of newly weaned piglets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enriching rearing environment is the strategy suggested for improving the post release survivorship of captive-reared animals. Here, an attempt has been made to evaluate the impact of early rearing enrichment on the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis (HPI axis), blood glucose, and brain dopaminergic and serotonergic systems of Tor putitora. Fifteen-day-old hatchlings of T. putitora were reared up to advanced fry stage in barren, semi-natural, and physically enriched environments and compared them with regard to pre-stress and post-stress levels of whole-body cortisol, blood glucose, brain serotonergic activity (5HIAA/5HT ratio), dopaminergic activity (DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA ratios) and norepinephrine (NE) levels. Significantly low basal whole-body cortisol, glucose and brain NE levels were observed in a physically enriched group of fish as compared to the other two groups. However, after acute stress, all rearing groups showed elevated levels of cortisol, blood glucose, brain 5HIAA/5HT, DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA ratios and NE levels but the magnitude of response was different among different rearing groups. The barren reared group showed a higher magnitude of response as compared to semi-natural and physically enriched groups. Similarly, the recovery rate of whole-body cortisol, blood glucose, and whole-brain monoamines were long-lasting in barren-reared mahseer. We illustrate that increased structural complexity (physical enrichment) during the early rearing significantly modulates various physiological and stress-coping mechanisms of mahseer.

AB  - Pre-pubertal stress increases post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) susceptibility. We have previously demonstrated that enriched environment (EE) intervention immediately after pre-pubertal stress protects from the effects of trauma in adulthood. Here, we examined whether exposure to EE would also be beneficial if applied after exposure to trauma in adulthood. We have recently shown that exposure to juvenile stress and under-water trauma (UWT) is associated with increased expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha 1 in the ventral hippocampus. However, differentiating between affected and unaffected individuals, this increased expression was confined to stress-exposed, behaviorally unaffected individuals, suggesting upregulation of alpha 1 expression as a potential mechanism of resilience. We now examined whether EE-induced resilience renders increased expression of alpha 1 in the ventral hippocampus redundant when facing a trauma later in life. Adult rats were exposed to UWT, with pre-exposure to juvenile stress, and tested in the open field and elevated plus maze paradigms four weeks later. EE exposure during juvenility prevented pre-pubertal stress-induced vulnerability, but not if performed following UWT in adulthood. Furthermore, juvenile EE exposure prevented the trauma-associated increase in alpha 1 expression levels. Our findings emphasize the importance of early interventions in order to reduce the likelihood of developing psychopathologies in adulthood.

AB  - Objectives: This study examined the beneficial effects of cerebrolysin (CBL) and enriched environment (EE), alone or in combination, on the neurobehavioral and molecular changes in the post-ischemic depression (PID) model in mice. Materials and Methods: PID was induced in male Balb/c mice (25-30 g) by combining the transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (bCCAO), twice for 5 min at the interval of 10 min, with spatial restraint stress (2 h/day) for 2 weeks, started 48 h following the establishment of bCCAO model. Animals in the treatment groups received CBL (2.5 ml/kg) and/or were housed in EE (2 h/day) for two weeks. Anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and sociability were evaluated the day after the last experiment. Changes in the serum corticosterone level, the hippocampal oxidative stress status, inflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB)/CREB ratio were also detected. Results: PID model induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and impaired social behavior. These behavioral changes were accompanied by increased serum corticosterone level, increased lipid peroxidation, decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced BDNF levels and p-CREB/CREB ratio, and increased protein levels of NF-kappa B and Iba-1 in the hippocampus. However, treatment with CBL and/or EE reversed behavioral and molecular changes induced by PID. Conclusion: Our findings imply that the model mimics many manifestations of human PID, and CBL and EE treatments, separately or in combination, are beneficial in reducing anxiety- and- depressive-like behaviors in this model.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is the enhancement of the physical or social environment in which an animal lives with the goal to improve its quality of life. Our objective was to investigate the effect of providing environmental enrichment in the home pen on responsiveness to novelty in laboratory-housed pigs. Pigs were housed (4 pigs per pen) in enriched (n = 32) or barren (control; n = 32) pens for 3 wk total and tested in 2 anxiety behavioral tests, the novel object (NOT) and human interaction (HIT) tests. Pigs were placed in a novel arena for a 5-min familiarization period, after which either a novel object (NOT) or an unfamiliar human (HIT) was introduced for a 5-min interaction period. Behavior in the home pen and during NOT and HIT was monitored through direct observations and videorecording. In the home pen, enriched pigs spent more time active and interacting with the environment, whereas control pigs spent more time inactive and in social interactions. In addition, enriched pigs crossed more squares during the familiarization period, tended to freeze more, and interacted less with the novel object or person than control pigs. In conclusion, enrichment may improve welfare by stimulating activity and decreasing aggressive behaviors in the home pen. However, enriched pigs may experience increased anxiety when exposed to novelty, whereas pigs housed without environmental enrichment-due to lack of stimulation in the home pen-may be more motivated to interact with sources of novelty or enrichment during testing than their enriched counterparts.

AB  - Major depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder and environmental factors have been strongly implicated in its pathophysiology. Clinical studies have demonstrated that stress or depression can lead to atrophy and cell loss in the hippocampus. Studies of animal models of depression have suggested that reduced neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus might contribute to such structural changes and to the behavior of these animals. On the other hand, increased hippocampal neurogenesis can be induced by the administration of antidepressants or electroconvulsive seizure, suggesting that increased neurogenesis might be related to the treatment of depression. Thus, an enriched environment (EE), which also enhances neurogenesis, is expected to have therapeutic effects on depression-related behaviors. To investigate the effects of an EE during adulthood on these behaviors, we subjected adult mice housed in an EE for five weeks to behavioral tests. In an open field test, EE mice exhibited a decrease in the distance traveled and an increase in the amount of time spent in the center. The startle response was smaller in EE mice than in control mice. EE mice also showed reduced immobility time in a forced swim test. The immobility time in EE mice was approximately half that observed in mice treated with a tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine. In our experimental condition, increased survival of newborn cells was observed in EE mice by 5 -bromo-2'-deoxyuri dine (BrdU)-labeled immunohistochemistry. Double-staining of BrdU and a mature neuron marker, NeuN, revealed that the majority of surviving cells were neurons. Our results suggest that EE, which enhanced the survival of newborn neurons, shows beneficial effects on behavioral despair and habituation to a novel environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sociability is the act or quality of social interaction and can be quantified by determining the number and duration of interactions with conspecifics. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which sustained social contact, as achieved by constant social living conditions, influenced social behavior. Beginning in juvenility, 19 male Long-Evans rats were housed in enriched environments, with half living socially in a large group and half living individually. After several months in these housing conditions. rats were tested on a sociality test and a social novelty preference test. Nonsocially housed rats exhibited more social behavior than socially housed rats. In the sociality test, nonsocially housed rats engaged with an unfamiliar rat more than socially housed rats. Similarly, in the social novelty test, nonsocially housed rats visited a novel stranger more than the now-familiar rat (from the sociality test) as compared with the socially housed rats. It is unlikely that general anxiety factors can account for between-groups social effects, as there were no group differences in behavior on the elevated zero maze and open field test. Furthermore, socially and nonsocially housed rats were matched in spontaneous object exploration and novelty preference in a novel object recognition test, eliminating the possibility that general exploratory behavior or novelty preference accounted for group differences in the sociability tasks. These results suggest that lack of social interaction in nonsocially housed rats may be more powerful for social motivation than the consistent opportunity for social contact afforded by social living conditions.

AB  - The male germ line is capable of transmitting a legacy of stress exposure to the next generation of offspring. This transgenerational process manifests by altering offspring affective behaviours, cognition and metabolism. Paternal early life trauma causes hippocampal serotonergic dysregulation in male offspring. We previously showed a transgenerational modification to male offspring anxiety-like behaviours by treatment of adult male breeders with corticosterone (CORT) prior to mating. In the present study, we used offspring from our paternal CORT model and characterised offspring serotonergic function by examining their responses to the 5HT(1A)R agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, sertraline. We also examined whether post-weaning environmental enrichment, a paradigm well-known to modulate serotonergic signalling in the brain, had the capacity to normalise the anxiety phenotype of male offspring. Finally, we assessed gene expression levels of 5HT(1A)R and serotonin transporter in the offspring hippocampus to determine whether deficits in gene transcription contributed to the male-only anxiety phenotype. We report that male and female offspring of CORT-treated fathers are hypersensitive to sertraline but have normal hypothermic responses to 8-OH-DPAT. No deficits in htr1a and sert were found in association with paternal CORT treatment, and environmental enrichment did not rescue the anxiety phenotype of male offspring on the elevated-plus maze. These findings indicate that varying forms of paternal stress exert different effects on offspring brain serotonergic function.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a widely used experimental manipulation that consistently shows measurable effects on rodent behaviour across the lifespan. This scoping review assesses and thematically summarizes the literature of the past decade concerning the effects of environmental enrichment applied during sensitive developmental periods in rodent mothers and offspring. Maternal behaviours as well as maternal and offspring anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours are considered. Relevant terms were searched across five databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science) and articles were screened with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining articles were thematically analysed. Our results suggest that a greater number of articles reviewed the impacts of environmental enrichment on offspring anxiety-like behaviour (n = 23) rather than on depressive-like behaviour (n = 11) or maternal caregiving behaviour (n = 12). Maternal anxiety(n = 4) or depressive-like (n = 2) behaviours are not often evaluated for in enrichment studies. The main behavioural tests of anxiety that were reviewed include the elevated plus-maze, the open field test, and the light-dark box whereas those for depression included the forced swim WA and the sucrose preference test. Our results yielded mixed findings and significant variation in behavioural responses across all tests. In mothers, trends of increased maternal care behaviours and decreased maternal depressive-like behaviours in enriched mothers were appreciated. Enrichment during the gestational period was identified as pivotal to creating behavioural change in mother subjects. In enriched offspring rodents, a trend towards decreased anxiety-like behaviours was observed most often. Potential confounds inherent in enrichment paradigms and relevant theories of enrichment and their relation to rodent behavioural tests are discussed.

AB  - People's affective or emotional state can alter their cognitive processing, biasing interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Those in a more positive state interpret such stimuli in a more optimistic manner than those in a negative state. Recently this research has extended to animals, and has shown that manipulations associated with negative affect cause animals to interpret ambiguous stimuli more pessimistically. We investigated whether exposure to environmental enrichment engenders optimistic responses to ambiguous stimuli. Rats, Rattus norvegicus, were trained on a novel conditional discrimination task whereby they learned the correct response necessary to obtain a food reward given the stimulus present during approach (rough or smooth sandpaper). One stimulus was associated with a higher-value reward than the other. Once the rats were trained, cognitive bias was probed by exploring their responses to an ambiguous stimulus (intermediate grade of sandpaper); a rat was defined as optimistic if it chose the response appropriate to the stimulus associated with the better reward. Animals transferred from unenriched to enriched cages showed more optimistic responses following the change. A control group maintained in unenriched cages showed pessimistic responses throughout. These results demonstrate for the first time that environmental enrichment can induce an optimistic cognitive bias in rats previously housed in standard caging, possibly indicative of a more positive affective state. These results add support to the suggestion that measuring cognitive biases can give an insight into animal emotional states; this has implications for animal welfare and preclinical testing of potential therapeutics for mood disorders.

AB  - Postsurgery sleep deprivation is a common complication that severely deteriorates the quality of life of patients. Here we aim to investigate the effects and mechanism of enriched environment in ameliorating sleep deprivation and memory impairments. Hernia repair surgery was performed on rats to induce sleep deprivation. Enriched environment (EE) was used to treat rats with sleep deprivation, and open field and Y-maze tests were performed to compare behavioral parameters of sleep deprivation rats with or without EE treatments to those of normal rats. To understand the mechanism, neurotrophic and growth factors including BDNF, NGF, NT-3 and GDNF were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AMPAR subunits, including GluA1-A3, and GABA(A) receptor alpha 1 subunit expression in hippocampus tissues were assessed using western blot. EE restored normal levels of anxiety index and freezing behavior in open field WA and level of alternation in Y-maze test, suggesting the reduction of anxiolytic effects and spatial memory impairment induced by sleep deprivation. EE increased BDNF levels and reduced NT-3 levels in sleep deprivation rats. GluA1/GluA2 ratio was increased by EE. GABA(A) receptor alpha 1 subunit expression was decreased by EE. EE is effective in ameliorating the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation in spatial memory impairment, and restoring normal levels of neurotrophic factors, which are potentially mediated by attenuating the changes in AMPAR subunit expression and reducing GABA(A) receptor al subunit expression. These data provide supporting evidences for the use of EE to treat adverse outcomes of sleep deprivation induced by surgery.

AB  - Repeated forced swimming test (rFST) may detect gradual effects of antidepressants in adult rats. Antidepressants, as enrichment, affected behavior and neurogenesis in rats. However, the influence of enrichment on behavioral and neurogenic effects of antidepressants is unknown. Here, effects of antidepressants on rFST and hippocampal neurogenesis were investigated in rats under enriched conditions. Behaviors of male Wistar rats, housed from weaning in standard (SE) or enriched environment (EE), were registered during rFST. The rFST consisted of 15 min of swimming (pretest) followed by 5 min of swimming in the first (test), seventh (retest 1) and fourteenth (retest 2) days after pretest. One hour before the test, rats received an intraperitoneal injection of saline (1 ml/kg), fluoxetine (2.5 mg/kg) or imipramine (2.5 or 5 mg/kg). These treatments were performed daily until the day of the retest 2. After retest 2, rats were euthanized for the identification of markers for neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Fluoxetine or imipramine decreased immobility in retests 1 and 2, as compared to saline. EE abolished these differences. In EE, fluoxetine or imipramine (5 mg/kg) reduced immobility time in retest 2, as compared to the test. Independent of the housing conditions, fluoxetine and imipramine (5 mg/kg) increased the ratio of immature neurons per progenitor cell in the hippocampus. In summary, antidepressants or enrichment counteracted the high immobility in rFST. Enrichment changed the effects of antidepressants in rFST depending on the type, and the dose of a substance but failed to change neurogenesis in control or antidepressant treated-rats. Effects of antidepressants and enrichment on rFST seemed neurogenesis-independent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The incidence of major depression is known to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. In the current study, we therefore set out to investigate depressive-like behavior and its modification by environmental enrichment using rats bred for 'learned helplessness'. 45 males of congenitally helpless (cLH, n = 22) and non-helpless (cNLH, n = 23) rats of two different generations were used to systematically investigate differential effects of environmental enrichment on learned helpless behavior, anhedonic-like behavior (sweetened condensed milk consumption) and spontaneous behavior in the home cage. While enrichment was found to reduce learned helpless behavior in 14 weeks old, but not 28 weeks old cLH rats, it did not affect the consumption of sweetened condensed milk. Regarding the home cage behavior, no consistent changes between rats of different strains, housing conditions, and ages were observed. We could thus demonstrate that a genetic predisposition for learned helplessness may interact with environmental conditions in mediating some, but not all depressive-like symptoms in congenitally learned helpless rats. However, future efforts are needed to isolate the differential benefits of environmental factors in mediating the different depression-related symptoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has shown remarkable effects in improving cognition and addictive behaviour. We tested whether EE could help recover from prenatal stress exposure. Mature Swiss Webster male and virgin female mice were placed together until vaginal plugs were detectable. Next, pregnant rodents were randomized into the control, physically and psychologically stressed groups. The application of stress was initiated on the 10th day of pregnancy and persisted for a week to induce stress in the mice. Open field and elevated plus-maze (EPM) tests were utilized as explorative and anxiety assays, respectively. A passive avoidance shuttle-box test was carried out to check anxiety-modulated behaviour. Morris water maze (MWM) test was undertaken to evaluate spatial learning and memory. Conditioned place preference (CPP) test was selected for evaluation of tendency to morphine consumption. Our results showed that prenatal stress elevated anxiety-like behaviour in the offspring which EE could significantly alleviate after weaning. We also found a higher preference for morphine use in the physical stress and psychological stress offspring group. However, no difference was observed among the genders. Application of EE for the stress group improved several parameters of the cognitive behaviour significantly. Although prenatal stress can lead to detrimental behavioural and cognitive outcomes, it can in part be relieved by early exposure to EE. However, some outcomes linked to prenatal stress exposure may not be diminished by EE therapy. In light of such irreversible effects, large-scale preventive actions promoting avoidance from stress during pregnancy should be advised.

AB  - Pig production is one of the main livestock activities around the world. However, the demand in the con-sumption of meat has caused the animals to be housed in small areas and with poor sensory stimula-tion, affecting their development and increasing their stress. The gestation stage is very stressful for sows, as they are housed individually in cages that limit their activity and locomotion. On the other hand, en- vironmental enrichment has been proposed to improve animal welfare. This study evaluated the effect of environmental enrichment during gestation on cortisol concentrations, farrowing behavior and productive parameters. The results showed that the sows of the group that did not receive enviromental enrichment during the gestation stage increased cortisol concentrations and the frequency of scratching, lifting during childbirth, hitting with the muzzle the feeder and the cage (behaviors associated whit pain and anxiety during farrowing), compared to sows that did receive enrichment (p < 0.05). However, environmental enrichment did not change the production parameters. This indicates that environmental enrichment during gestation can improve the ability of the pregnant sow to cope with stress, without affecting its productivity.

AB  - The late adolescent period is characterized by marked neurodevelopmental and endocrine fluctuations in the transition to early adulthood. Adolescents are highly responsive to the external environment, which enhances their ability to adapt and recover from challenges when given nurturing influences, but also makes them vulnerable to aberrant development when exposed to prolonged adverse situations. Female rats are particularly sensitive to the effects of chronic stress in adolescence, which manifests as passive coping strategies and blunted hypothalamo-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) stress responses in adulthood. We sought to intervene by exposing adolescent rats to environmental enrichment (EE) immediately prior to and during chronic stress, hypothesizing that EE would minimize or prevent the long-term effects of stress that emerge in adult females. To test this, we exposed male and female rats to EE on postnatal days (PND) 33-60 and implemented chronic variable stress (CVS) on PND 40-60. CVS consisted of twice-daily unpredictable stressors. Experimental groups included: CVS/unenriched, unstressed/EE, CVS/EE and unstressed/unenriched (n=10 of each sex/group). In adulthood, we measured behavior in the open field test and forced swim test (FST) and collected blood samples following the FST. We found that environmental enrichment given during the adolescent period prevented the chronic stress-induced transition to passive coping in the FST and reversed decreases in peak adrenocortical responsiveness observed in adult females. Adolescent enrichment had little to no effect on males or unstressed females tested in adulthood, indicating that beneficial effects are specific to females that were exposed to chronic stress.

AB  - Environmental enrichment and physical exercise have many well-established health benefits. Although these environmental manipulations are known to delay symptom onset and progression in a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. A notable candidate molecular mechanism is that of microRNA, a family of small noncoding RNAs that are important regulators of gene expression. Research investigating the many diverse roles of microRNAs has greatly expanded over the past decade, with several promising preclinical and clinical studies highlighting the role of dysregulated microRNA expression (in the brain, blood and other peripheral systems) in understanding the aetiology of disease. Altered microRNA levels have also been described following environmental interventions such as exercise and environmental enrichment in non-clinical populations and wild-type animals, as well as in some brain disorders and associated preclinical models. Recent studies exploring the effects of stimulating environments on microRNA levels in the brain have revealed an array of changes that are likely to have important downstream effects on gene expression, and thus may regulate a variety of cellular processes. Here we review literature that explores the differential expression of microRNAs in rodents following environmental enrichment and exercise, in both healthy control animals and preclinical models of relevance to neurological and psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Male Lister hooded rats were reared from weaning either singly or in groups of three in either barren or enriched cages (n = 9 each) to study effects of isolation rearing and environmental enrichment on open-field activity, object exploration, activity in the Light/Dark box (L/D box), spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity in response to restraint stress. Regardless of inanimate background, isolation rearing mainly enhanced activity under several conditions of environmental novelty. By contrast, environmental enrichment, regardless of social background, primarily accelerated habituation to novelty and improved spatial learning and memory. None of the treatments significantly altered basal and response levels of plasma ACTH and corticosterone. Furthermore, rats reared singly in barren cages showed persistent activity in the L/D box, indicating an interaction between isolation-induced hyperactivity and reduced habituation due to barren caging. These results show that isolation rearing and environmental enrichment affect behaviour selectively, while at the same time revealing biologically relevant interactions between social and inanimate stimulation. It is concluded that systematic variation of social and inanimate stimulation can help distinguish between effects that generalise across variation in environmental background and effects that are idiosyncratic to a specific environmental background.

AB  - Environmental enrichment involves increasing the complexity of a fish's environment in order to improve welfare. Researchers are legally obliged to consider the welfare of laboratory animals and poor welfare may result in less robust data in experimental science. Laboratory zebrafish Danio rerio are usually kept in bare aquaria for ease of husbandry and, despite being a well-studied species, little is known about how laboratory housing affects their welfare. This study shows that environmental enrichment, in the form of the addition of gravel substratum and plants into the tank, affects survivorship, growth and behaviour in laboratory-maintained D. rerio. Larvae reared in enriched tanks had significantly higher survivorship compared with larvae reared in bare tanks. Effects of the tank conditions on growth were more variable. Females from enriched tanks had a higher body condition than females maintained in bare tanks, but intriguingly this was not the case for males, where the only difference was a more variable body condition in males maintained in bare tanks. Sex ratio in the rearing tanks did not differ between treatments. Resource monopolisation was higher for fish in enriched tanks than for those in bare tanks. Fish from enriched tanks displayed lower levels of behaviours associated with anxiety compared with fish from bare tanks when placed into a novel environment. Thus, this study demonstrates differences in welfare for D. rerio maintained under different environmental conditions with enhancements in welfare more commonly associated with tank enrichment.

AB  - Exposure to enriched environment (EE) can influence expression of depression symptoms, however, the underlying mechanism has not been established, although neurogenesis was probably involved. It has been reported that EE stimulates glucocorticoids release. However, the role of corticosterone (CORT) in effects of EE is still unknown. To address these issues, we examined depression-like behaviors of the animals exposed to EE with tow dose CORT supplement following bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX + CORT). Two months after housing, tail suspension test and forced swim test were used to assess depression-related behavior of mice. Serum CORT levels were measured by radio-immunoassay. Signals of DNA synthesis marker bromodeoxyuridine and immature neuronal marker doublecortin were measured by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that EE significantly decreased immobility time of the mice in both the tail suspension test and forced swim test, showing distinctive antidepressive behaviors. Exposure to EE also increased serum CORT level, and prevention of this increase with ADX + CORT eliminated the decrease of immobility time of the animals. Both the mice exposed to EE and those receiving ADX + CORT treatment showed enhanced newly born cells and immature granule neurons in the hippocampus. Taken together, our data suggest that glucocorticoids elevation is required for antidepressive behaviors of EE. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, we determined the effects of environmental enrichment (EE; Kong Toys (R) and Nestlets (R)) on sexually diergic HPA axis responses to single-dose nicotine (NIC), single-dose NIC following continuous NIC administration for two weeks, and NIC withdrawal by single-dose mecamylamine (MEC) in male and female rats. Blood sampling occurred before and after MEC and NIC administrations for the determination of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT).
   Supporting and extending our previous findings, EE appeared to produce anxiolytic effects by reducing hormone responses: Male and female rats housed with EE had lower baseline ACTH and significantly lower HPA axis responses to the mild stress of saline (SAL) injection than did those housed without EE. The sexually diergic responses to single dose NIC, continuous NIC, and MEC-induced NIC withdrawal were reduced by EE in many male and female groups. ACTH responses to continuous NIC and MEC-induced NIC withdrawal were blunted to a greater extent in female EE groups than in male EE groups, suggesting that females are more sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of EE. Because EE lowered stress-responsive hormones of the HPA axis in most groups, EE may be a useful intervention for stress reduction in animal models of NIC addiction. As well, the effectiveness of EE in animal studies of NIC withdrawal may enlighten human studies addressing coping styles and tobacco cessation in men and women. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental setting broadly used for investigating the effects of complex social, cognitive, and sensorimotor stimulations on brain structure and function. Recent studies point out that parental EE experience, even occurring in the pre-reproductive phase, affects neural development and behavioral trajectories of the offspring. In the present study we investigated the influences of pre-reproductive EE of female rats on maternal behavior and adolescent male offspring's coping response to an inescapable stressful situation after chronic social isolation. For this purpose female Wistar rats were housed from weaning to breeding age in enriched or standard environments. Subsequently, all females were mated and housed in standard conditions until offspring weaning. On the first post partum day (ppd 1), mother-pup interactions in undisturbed conditions were recorded. Further, after weaning the male pups were reared for 2 weeks under social isolation or in standard conditions, and then submitted or not to a single-session Forced Swim Test (FST). Offspring's neuronal activation and plastic changes were identified by immunohistochemistry for c-Fos and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and assessed by using stereological analysis. The biochemical correlates were measured in the hippocampus, amygdala and cingulate cortex, structures involved in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis regulation. Enriched dams exhibited increased Crouching levels in comparison to standard reared dams. In the offspring of both kinds of dams, social isolation reduced body weight, decreased Immobility, and increased Swimming during FST. Moreover, isolated offspring of enriched dams exhibited higher levels of Climbing in comparison to controls. Interestingly, in the amygdala of both isolated and control offspring of enriched dams we found a lower number of c-Fos immunopositive cells in response to FST and a higher number of GRs in comparison to the offspring of standard dams. These results highlight the profound influence of a stressful condition, such as the social isolation, on the brain of adolescent rats, and underline intergenerational effects of maternal experiences in regulating the offspring response to stress.

AB  - Background: One of the most serious complications of sepsis is sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), which impairs the cognition ability of survivors. Environmental enrichment (EE) has been demonstrated to alleviate cognition deficits under many kinds of brain injury conditions. However, EE's effects on SAE remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine EE's effect on cognition disorders under SAE conditions and the underlying mechanism. Materials and Methods: Adult male rats, subject to SAE or not, were housed under a standard environment (SE) or EE for 30 days. Subsequently, the rats were subjected to cognitive tests, such as the novel object recognition (NOR) test, the Morris water maze (MWM) test, an Open Field (OF) test, the elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and a sensory neglect (SN) test. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress changes in the brain were also detected. Results: The results revealed that SAE impaired somatesthesia, recognition memory, spatial learning and memory, and exploratory activity, which were significantly improved by EE housing. EE also prevented SAE-induced anxiety-like behavior. In addition, EE housing capable induced a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant properties in the brain. Moreover, EE housing exerted an anti-apoptosis function by upregulating the level of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) level and downregulating the level of p53 level in the hippocampus. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicated that EE exerts a neuroprotective function on cognitive ability in SAE rats. The effect is achieved by increasing antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic capacities. EE can effectively rescue SAE-induced cognitive deficits.

AB  - Exposure to enriched environment (EE) has been indicated to enhance cognitive functions, hippocampal neural plasticity, neurogenesis, long-term potentiation, and levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in laboratory animals. Also, studies on the sex-dependent effects of exposure to EE during adolescence on adult cognitive functions are less. This is important because the beneficial effects of EE may be predominant in the adolescence stage. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the effects of EE during adolescence (PND21-PND60) on novel objective recognition memory (NORM), anxiety-like behaviors, and hippocampal BDNF mRNA level in the adult male and female rats. Assessment of NORM and anxiety-like behaviors has been done by novel objective recognition task, open field (OF), and elevated plus maze (EPM), respectively. The expression of BDNF mRNA level was also evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Our findings demonstrated that housing in the EE during adolescence improves NORM in adult male rats. Also, exposure to EE during adolescence had a different effect on anxiety-like behaviors in both sexes. Additionally, our results indicated an augmented BDNF level in the hippocampus of male and female rats. In conclusion, adolescent exposure to EE has sex-dependent effects on cognitive functions and anxiety-like behaviors and increases BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus of both male and female rats; thus, BDNF is an important factor that can mediate the beneficial effects of EE and running exercise on cognitive functions and psychiatric traits.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental animal model that enhances an animal's opportunity to interact with sensory, motor, and social stimuli, compared to standard laboratory conditions. A prominent benefit of EE is the reduction of stress-induced anxiety. The relationship between stress and the onset of anxiety-like behavior has been widely investigated in experimental research, showing a clear correlation with structural changes in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, the mechanisms by which EE exerts its protective roles in stress and anxiety remain unclear, and it is not known whether EE reduces the effects of acute stress on animal behavior shortly following the cessation of stress. We found that EE can prevent the emergence of anxiety-like symptoms in rats measured immediately after acute restraint stress (1 h) and this effect is not due to changes in systemic release of corticosterone. Rather, we found that stress promotes a rapid increase in the nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the BLA, an effect prevented by previous EE exposure. Furthermore, we observed a reduction of ERK (a MAPK protein) and CREB activity in the BLA promoted by both EE and acute stress. Finally, we found that EE decreases the expression of the immediate-early gene EGR-1 in the BLA, indicating a possible reduction of neuronal activity in this region. Hyperactivity of BLA neurons has been reported to accompany anxiety-like behavior and changes in this process may be one of the mechanism by which EE exerts its protective effects against stress-induced anxiety.

AB  - Simple Summary Group housing of growing rabbits is currently used in commercial farms to improve animal welfare. However, these systems have shown some weaknesses, mainly associated with the aggressive behavior exhibited among rabbits. Environmental enrichment can offer additional space and a sheltered area in which an animal can protect itself from pen mates, but studies in rabbits under farming conditions are scarce. Thus, this study evaluated the use of two types of enrichment (an elevated plastic-slatted platform and/or a plastic hiding tube) in rabbits housed in collective pens within large groups during the growing period. The use of the platform allowed rabbits to move up/down, to rest in a more comfortable position and to increase explorative behavior, without modifying production performance. However, more injured rabbits were found at the end of the trial in pens with platforms. The presence of the tube impaired growth performance and did not modify behavior. Hence, elevated platforms have been shown to work as a structural enrichment in group-housed rabbits, whereas the usefulness of the tube remains questionable. This study assessed the effects of an elevated plastic-slatted platform and/or a plastic hiding tube in collective pens with large group sizes (27 or 36 rabbits/pen; 16 rabbits/m(2)) on the performance and welfare of rabbits kept from weaning (at 33 days of age) to slaughter (at 68 or 75 days of age). Growth performance, injuries, and behavior (video recorded for 24 h) of rabbits (n = 504) were recorded. The platform allowed rabbits to adopt the rearing position more frequently (+0.14 events during 2 min every 30 min across 24 h) and to rest with stretched body for longer (+3.8% of observed time) (p <= 0.001). Production parameters and reactivity at the open field test were not modified, but the occurrence of injured rabbits at the trial end was higher in pens with platforms (+8.9%; p <= 0.01). This result was possibly related to the higher group size in pens with platforms (36 rabbits) compared to those without platforms (27 rabbits). The inclusion of the tube decreased growth (-2.2 g/d; p <= 0.05), whereas it was scarcely used by rabbits and it did not substantially change their behavior or the occurrence of injuries. In conclusion, under the experimental conditions of this study, elevated platforms worked as a useful structural enrichment in view of animal behavior but negatively impacted on the rate of injuries, whereas the usefulness of the tube was not confirmed.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is an environmental paradigm encompassing sensory, cognitive, and physical stimulation at a heightened level. Previous studies have reported the beneficial effects of EE in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. EE improves cognitive function as well as ameliorates depressive and anxiety-like behaviors, making it a potentially effective neuroprotective strategy against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we summarize the current evidence for EE as a neuroprotective strategy as well as the potential molecular pathways that can explain the effects of EE from a biochemical perspective using animal models. The effectiveness of EE in enhancing brain activity against neurodegeneration is explored with a view to differences present in early and late life EE exposure, with its potential application in human being discussed. We discuss EE as one of the non pharmacological approaches in preventing or delaying the onset of AD for future research.

AB  - Pediatric asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA) often leaves children with physical, cognitive, and emotional disabilities that affect overall quality of life, yet rehabilitation is neither routinely nor systematically provided. Environmental enrichment (EE) is considered a preclinical model of neurorehabilitation and thus we sought to investigate its efficacy in our established model of pediatric ACA. Male Sprague-Dawley rat pups (post-natal day 16-18) were randomly assigned to ACA (9.5 min) or Sham injury. After resuscitation, the rats were assigned to 21 days of EE or standard (STD) housing during which time motor, cognitive, and anxiety-like (i.e., affective) outcomes were assessed. Hippocampal CA(1) cells were quantified on post-operative day-22. Both ACA + STD and ACA + EE performed worse on beam-balance vs. Sham controls (p < 0.05) and did not differ from one another overall (p > 0.05); however, a single day analysis on the last day of testing revealed that the ACA + EE group performed better than the ACA + STD group (p < 0.05) and did not differ from the Sham controls (p > 0.05). Both Sham groups performed better than ACA + STD (p < 0.05) but did not differ from ACA + EE (p > 0.05) in the open field test. Spatial learning and declarative memory were improved and CA1 neuronal loss was attenuated in the ACA + EE vs. ACA + STD group (p < 0.05). Collectively, the data suggest that providing rehabilitation after pediatric ACA can reduce histopathology and improve motor and cognitive ability.

AB  - Early life experiences could determine brain and behavioral development. Neurotrophic factors are likely to mediate the effects of the experience on brain structures and function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a central role in psychiatric disorders. To investigate the effects of early rearing condition on the amygdala - and serum - BDNF levels, we reared male Wistar rats from weaning (postnatal days 21) to adulthood (postnatal days 119) in three different rearing conditions: (1) enriched, (2) standard and (3) isolated. We found that long-term post-weaning environmental enrichment leads to lower amygdala - and serum - BDNF levels as well as lower brain weights. Grouped rearing in standard laboratory cages enhanced body weight. Thus, early rearing condition might play a crucial role in adult healthiness by predetermining individual BDNF profiles.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has an influential role in reducing behavioral reactivity to stress. We previously observed that EE reduces the anxiety-like behavior in the field mouse Mus booduga accompanied by a reduction in the expression of molecules involved in the stress pathway. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of different housing condition on regulation of micro-RNA-183-SC35-mediated splicing of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adult male M. booduga were captured from an agricultural field and housed under nonenriched standard conditions (SC) for 7 days and considered as directly from the wild (DW). On day 8, individuals were randomly assigned to three groups; DW, SC, and EE. The DW group's anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT). The SC and EE groups were transferred to their respective conditions and housed for another 30 days. The mice housed in EE showed less anxiety-like behavior on EPM and in OFT compared with DW and SC mice. Interestingly, miR-183 expression was increased following exposure to EPM in EE mice but not in SC mice. Subsequently, the upregulated miR-183 expression suppresses the SC35 expression and shifting of splicing from AChE-S (synaptic) to AChE-R (read-through) form, whereas standard housing condition downregulate miR-183 and induces the splicing of AChE. The upregulated AChE-R form possibly terminates ACh transmission, which is reflected in the level of anxiety-like behavior. Overall, the present study suggests that EE effectively regulates the miR-183 pathway to reduce anxiety-like behavior. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Behaviour and use of the cage area were studied in 96 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) kept in an enriched cage system - with access to shelter and raised height at the back of the cage - and in a conventional cage system to estimate the effects of the environmental enrichment on the rabbits' welfare. The rabbits' behaviour and placement in the cage were observed, using continuous video recording through 24 h and direct scan sampling during the daytime. In addition, an open-field test was carried out with each rabbit, and after every single test, the rabbits' timidity of being captured was recorded. Rabbits kept in the conventional cage system, especially the females, showed more restlessness, excessive grooming, bar-gnawing and timidity than rabbits kept in the enriched cage system. This indicates increased stress in the rabbits kept in the conventional, cage system. All the rabbits performed most of the active behavioural elements in the daytime and were resting mostly at night that shows that the rabbits in both cage systems were adapted to the daily activity in the animal unit; the enrichment had no effect on the daytime activity.
   Only a few rabbits, particularly the females, used the box as a shelter or resting-place. On the other hand, they more often used the roof of the box as a look-out or resting-place. Furthermore, the rabbits' behaviour showed that they utilised the raised height in the enriched cage system.
   These results indicate that rabbits kept in an enriched cage system, particularly the females, had better welfare than rabbits kept in a conventional cage system because they had access to shelter and a better chance of interacting with the environment.

AB  - Mice housed in an enriched environment (EE) have inhibited tumor development because of eustress (positive stress) stimulation. However, the mechanisms underlying increased cancer resistance in EEs remain unclear; this may be due to poor reproducibility of the results because of the complicated EE assembly requirements. In this study, we examined the effects of a simplified EE (sEE) model, consisting only of a nesting shelter and a running wheel, on cancer development in mice. We found that, similar to the complex EE, the sEE promoted motor function and alleviated anxiety in mice. Moreover, the mice housed in the sEE showed inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in addition to a higher average body temperature (especially at the point of transition from light to darkness). Furthermore, mice in the sEE had a decreased brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass, with a significant upregulation of the Ucp1 and Adrb3 genes (which encode uncoupling protein 1 and beta-adrenergic receptor, respectively) observed in the BAT at the point of transition from light to darkness. An antibody against the immune checkpoint protein programmed cell death 1 was also found to have an additive effect with the sEE against tumor development. Our findings indicate that the established sEE model may be a useful tool for studying the antitumor effects of eustress and can potentially introduce new avenues for cancer prevention and treatment.

AB  - Acute and chronic stressors are common triggers of human mental illnesses. Experimental animal models and their cross-species translation to humans are critical for understanding of the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Mounting evidence suggests that both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches can be efficient in treating these disorders. Here, we analyze human, rodent and zebrafish (Danio rerio) data to compare the impact of non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies of stress-related psycho-pathologies. Emphasizing the likely synergism and interplay between pharmacological and environmental factors in mitigating daily stress both clinically and in experimental models, we argue that environmental enrichment emerges as a promising complementary therapy for stress-induced disorders across taxa. We also call for a broader use of novel model organisms, such as zebrafish, to study such treatments and their potential interplay.

AB  - Communication between the nervous and the immune systems suffers impairment with aging, which explains the altered homeostasis and the resulting increase of morbidity and mortality in aged subjects. In humans, rats and specially in mice, we have proposed several models to study this fact. The established models of premature aging have been mice and humans with poor response to stress and anxiety versus subjects of the same chronological age without that characteristic, isolation, males versus females, menopausal models (in rodents after ovariectomy) and obesity. In all cases, the prematurely aged animals suffer an alteration of the nervous system (shown by behavioral tests) and immunosenescence as well as oxidative and inflammatory stress, which is followed by early mortality. In addition, in the above-mentioned models and in normal chronological aging, we have observed the effect of several lifestyle strategies, such as ingestion of adequate amounts of antioxidants, performance of moderate physical exercise, and different kinds of environmental enrichment, which improve the function of the immune cells and their redox state as well as animal behavior. Therefore, they retard the aging process and seem to increase the longevity of the individuals. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly submitted to either enriched, social, or isolated environments during the early postweaning period (postnatal days 22-32) and were then behaviorally evaluated in the elevated-plus maze and euthanized for histological analysis. Vermal Purkinje cells (sub-lobules VIa and VIb) were sampled, drawn under camera lucida and morphometrically assessed using the Sholl's concentric ring method. Data obtained indicate that environmental enrichment did not significantly modify the Purkinje cell dendritic branching. On the contrary, Purkinje cell of animals reared in social isolation exhibited a significant reduction in dendritic arborization, which was closely associated with anxiety-like behaviors. The data obtained indicate that, although environmental stimulation in normal animals does not produce significant changes in vermal Purkinje cell dendritic arborization, these cells are vulnerable to early stressful experiences, which is in close association with anxiety-like behaviors.

AB  - Throughout the lifespan, the brain has a considerable degree of plasticity and can be strongly influenced by sensory input from the outside environment. Given the importance of the environment in the regulation of the brain structure, behavior and physiology, the aim of the present work was to analyze the effects of different environmental qualities during two critical ontogenic periods (early life and peripuberty) on behavior and hippocampal physiology.
   Male Wistar rats were separated from their mothers for 4.5 h daily during the first 3 weeks of life. They were weaned on day 21 and housed under either standard or enriched conditions. At 60 d of age, all animals were then housed in same-treatment groups, two per cage, until testing began on day 74. Emotional and cognitive responses were tested using the open field, novel object recognition test and step-down inhibitory avoidance learning. In the dorsal hippocampus, glucocorticoid receptor expression and neuronal activity were examined by immunoreactivity.
   Grooming behavior in the open field was found to be significantly lower in maternally separated animals, but post-weaning environmental enrichment completely reversed this tendency. Inhibitory avoidance but not object recognition memory was impaired in maternally separated animals, suggesting that early maternal separation alters learning and memory in a task-specific manner. Again, environmental enrichment reversed the effects of maternal separation on the inhibitory avoidance task. Even though maternal separation did not significantly affect Fos and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, environmental enrichment increased both Fos expression in the total hippocampal area and also the overall number of GR positive cells per hippocampal area, mainly due to the changes in CA1.
   These findings suggest that differential rearing is a useful procedure to study behavioral and physiological plasticity in response to early experience and that, although the effects of adverse experience early in life such as maternal separation can persist until adulthood, some of them can be compensated by early favorable environments, possibly through nervous system plasticity.

AB  - We assessed the antidepressant-like effects of environmental enrichment (EE) and physical exercise (PE) compared with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine against the depression-related neurobehavioral alterations induced by postweaning social isolation (SI) in rats. After 1 month of SI, rats were submitted to PE (treadmill), EE, or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), which were compared with naive SI and group-housed rats. After 1 month, behavior was analyzed in the open field (OFT), the sucrose preference (SPT), and the forced swimming (FST) tests. Afterward, the hippocampal serotonin contents, its metabolite, and turnover were measured. SI induced a depression-related phenotype characterized by a marginal bodyweight gain, anxiety, anhedonia, behavioral despair, and alterations of serotonin metabolism. EE produced the widest and largest antidepressive-like effect, followed by PE and fluoxetine, which were almost equivalent. The treatments, however, affected differentially the neurobehavioral domains investigated. EE exerted its largest effect on anhedonia and was the only treatment inducing anxiolytic-like effects. Fluoxetine, in contrast, produced its largest effect on serotonin metabolism, followed by its anti-behavioral despair action. PE was a middle-ground treatment with broader behavioral outcomes than fluoxetine, but ineffective to reverse the serotonergic alterations induced by SI. The most responsive test to the treatments was the FST, followed closely by the SPT. Although OFT locomotion and body weight varied considerably between groups, they were barely responsive to PE and fluoxetine. From a translational standpoint, our data suggest that exercise and recreational activities may have broader health benefits than antidepressants to overcome confinement and the consequences of chronic stress.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is a typical experimental method that promotes levels of novelty and complexity that enhance experience-dependent neuroplasticity and cognitive behavior function in laboratory animals. Early EE is associated with resilience in the face of later-life challenges. Since increased synaptic activity enhances endogenous neuronal antioxidant defenses, we hypothesized that long-term EE beginning at an early stage may alter the levels of oxidative stress. We investigated global protein expression and oxidative stress in hippocampal proteins from rats nurtured for a 6-month EE beginning in the prenatal period. The analysis of protein expression was carried out using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis with matrix-associated laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Proteins with altered expression were involved in energy metabolism (phosphoglycerate mutase 1 alpha-enolase isoform 1, adenylate kinase 1, and triose phosphate isomerase) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase 1, glutathione S- transferase omega type 1, peroxiredoxin 5, DJ-1, and glial maturation factor beta). Using Western blot assays, some of the proteins with altered expression and NADPH oxidase 2 were confirmed to be decreased. Further confirmation was demonstrated with attenuated expression of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine, a DNA oxidative stress marker, in the hippocampus of EE group rats. Our data demonstrate that a long-term EE program beginning in the prenatal and early postnatal phase of development modulates energy metabolism and reduced oxidant stress possibly through enhanced synaptic activity. We provide evidence that EE can be developed as a tool to protect the brain from oxidative stress-induced injury. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Depressive-like forms of waking inactivity have been recently observed in laboratory primates and horses. We tested the hypotheses that being awake but motionless within the home-cage is a depression-like symptom in mice, and that in impoverished housing, it represents an alternative response to stereotypic behaviour. We raised C57BL/6 ('C57') and DBA/2 ('DBA') females to adulthood in non-enriched (n = 62 mice) or enriched (n = 60 mice) cages, observing home-cage behaviour during the active (dark) phases. We predicted that being still but awake would be reduced by environmental enrichment; more pronounced in C57s, as the strain most prone to learned helplessness; negatively related to stereotypic behaviour; and positively related to immobility in Forced Swim Tests (FST). Compared to enriched mice, non-enriched subjects did spend more time spent being inactive but awake, especially if they displayed relatively little stereotypic behaviour. C57 mice also spent more time awake but motionless than DBA5. Furthermore, even after statistically controlling for housing type and strain, this behaviour very strongly tended to predict increased immobility in the FST, while high levels of stereotypic behaviours in contrast predicted low immobility in the FST. Being awake but motionless is thus a reaction to non-enriched housing that seems to be an alternative to stereotypic behaviour, and could reflect depression-like states. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) involves enhancing an animal's environment, with the goal of improving animal welfare. Though a well-established discipline, the consequences of EE on behavioural pharmacological tests have not been extensively examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the consequences of EE (or isolation) housing on a range of behavioural pharmacological tests in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the 3 housing conditions; IC (isolation) and SC (standard group-housed, 4/cage) were housed in standard cages (42 cm x 25.5 cm x 20 cm), while the EE group was housed in groups of 4 in larger cages (54 cm x 38 cm x 19 cm) enriched with a variety of wooden, cardboard and plastic toys/objects. After 4 weeks, housing effects were examined in the following pharmacological tests: diazepam (DZP) effects on anxiolytic behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM); desipramine (DMI) effects on immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) and amphetamine (AMP) effects on homecage activity. Dose-response assessments demonstrated that rats housed in EE showed reduced sensitivity to the behavioural effects of DZP and DMI but increased sensitivity to the locomotor-enhancing effects of AMP compared to SC and IC; while IC animals exhibited the clearest dose-response effects to increasing doses of DMI. It may be concluded that environmental manipulation can vary along a continuum and its intensity may be crucial to observable effects. Nonetheless, environmental factors can influence sensitivity to psychotropic drugs and should be considered when implementing EE protocols in such evaluations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary Shelters are stressful environments for dogs, and this can lead to increased arousal levels, resulting in behaviour and welfare issues. Reducing arousal levels may be achieved with targeted sensory environmental enrichment. We exposed dogs to three different stimuli to reduce arousal and compared responses to these with a Control group. Dogs exposed to any of the stimuli vocalised less than the Control, and when exposed to Music and DAP they showed more resting behaviours than the Control. These behaviours are associated with increased relaxation and less arousal, and therefore these stimuli appear appropriate for use in a shelter environment. The results suggest that small changes to the environment of shelter dogs can have positive effects on their behaviour, which could help improve the quality of their experience while in care.
   Abstract Shelter environments are stressful for dogs, as they must cope with many stimuli over which they have little control. This can lead to behavioural changes, negatively affect their welfare and downgrade the human-animal bond, affecting re-homing success. Arousal is evident in their behaviour, particularly increased activity and frequent vocalisation. Environmental enrichment plays an important role in reducing arousal behaviour, either through direct physiological effects or by masking stressful stimuli. The present study focused on sensory environmental enrichment, using olfactory and auditory stimuli under shelter conditions. Sixty dogs were allocated to one of four treatments: three types of enrichment, Lavender, Dog appeasing pheromone (DAP) and Music, and a Control group. Stimuli were applied for 3 h/d on five consecutive days. Dogs exposed to DAP lay down more, and those exposed to Music lay down more with their head down, compared to the Control. Those in the Control stood more on their hind legs with their front legs on the exit door, compared to those exposed to Music and DAP, particularly if they had only been in the shelter for a short time. They also panted and vocalised much more than dogs in the three enrichment treatments, which tended to persist during the 4 h period post treatment, and in the case of vocalisation into the subsequent night. The study suggests that all three enrichments had some positive benefits for dogs in shelters, as well as being non-invasive and easy to apply in the shelter environment.

AB  - Objective:The Western diet (WD), which is rich in highfat diet (HFD) and high-sucrose diet (HSD), is related to oxidative stress. Enriched environment (EE) with social interaction, physical exercise and continuous learning tasks has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, the inflammatory response, and increase the anti-oxidative defense. Therefore, the present study has aimed to clarify the effects of the EE and WD-fed rats on marker malondialdehyde (MDA) and trace element (TE) levels (iron [Fe], copper [Cu], zinc [Zn], chromium [Cr], selenium [Se], magnesium [Mg] and molybdenum [Mo]).
   Material and Method: Male Wistar albino rats were housed in either an enrichment (n=24) or standard environment (n=24) and fed with HFD (35% of energy as fat) (n=8), HSD (100% of carbohydrate as sucrose) (n=8), or standard rat chow(n=8), for 4 weeks. Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for determination of the serum TE levels.
   Results: The serum levels of MDA (p<0.05), Fe, Cu, Mo and Mg increased, while the serum levels of Cr and Se decreased, and additionally, the serum levels of Zn did not changed in the HFD and HSD groups. EE decreased partially the serum levels of MDA, Fe, Mo, and did not affect the serum levels of Cu, while it increased the serum levels of Mg, Cr, Se and Zn; however, there was no significant difference between all of the experimental groups (all; p>0.05).
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that HFD and HSD led to oxidative stress and adversely affected the serum level of TE in rats, and that the EE reversed partially this status.

AB  - Background Social isolation (SI) early in life produces behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. On the contrary, environmental enrichment (EE) offers beneficial effects on brain plasticity and development. This study was designed to examine how EE affects memory functions, anxiety level, and the expression levels of memory/anxiety-related genes such as NR2A, NR2B, BDNF, and cFos in the hippocampus of socially isolated rats. Materials and Methods Wistar albino male rats (n = 40) were separated into the five groups: Standard cage (SC), SI, EE, SI + SC, and SI + EE group. For each group, eight rats were housed, either grouped or isolated, in a standard or 3-week EE, respectively. Morris water maze test (MWMT) was used for measuring the learning and memory function. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) were used for the evaluation of anxiety behavior. Blood corticosterone level was evaluated by the ELISA method. The expression levels of genes were measured by the RT-PCR method. Results Results showed that EE increased memory performance in the SI group (p < 0.05). SI caused anxiety while EE improved anxiety behavior (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in the OF test. Corticosterone levels did not change between groups. BDNF expression level was downregulated in EE and SI + SC compared with the SC group (respectively; p = 0.012; p = 0.011). NR2A, NR2B, and cFos expression levels did not change between groups significantly. Conclusions SI impaired memory performance while EE has beneficial effects on memory in socially isolated rats. EE alone was insufficient to cause alterations in the memory performance. The therapeutic effects of EE became strengthened while applied together with stress protocol. Together with improving the effectiveness of memory function, EE has the potential to decrease anxiety behavior. EE seemed to be the reason for decreasing in BDNF.

AB  - Microglia play an important role in fine-tuning neuronal activity. In part, this involves their production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), which increases neuronal excitability. Excessive synaptic activity is necessary to initiate spreading depression (SD). Increased microglial production of proinflammatory cytokines promotes initiation of SD, which, when recurrent, may play a role in conversion of episodic to high frequency and chronic migraine. Previous work shows that this potentiation of SD occurs through increased microglial production of TNF alpha and reactive oxygen species, both of which are associated with an M1-skewed microglial population. Hence, we explored the role of microglia and their M1 polarization in SD initiation. Selective ablation of microglia from rat hippocampal slice cultures confirmed that microglia are essential for initiation of SD. Application of minocycline to dampen M1 signaling led to increased SD threshold. In addition, we found that SD threshold was increased in rats exposed to environmental enrichment. These rats had increased neocortical levels of interleukin-11 (IL-11), which decreases TNF alpha signaling and polarized microglia to an M2a-dominant phenotype. M2a microglia reduce proinflammatory signaling and increase production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and therefore may protect against SD. Nasal administration of IL-11 to mimic effects of environmental enrichment likewise increased M2a polarization and increased SD threshold, an effect also seen in vitro. Similarly, application of conditioned medium from M2a polarized primary microglia to slice cultures also increased SD threshold. Thus, microglia and their polarization state play an essential role in SD initiation, and perhaps by extension migraine with aura and migraine. GLIA 2014;62:1176-1194

AB  - Studies in rodents suggested that environmental enrichment can improve the ability of animals to cope with stressful situations. In this study, the effect of environmental enrichment was evaluated on the behavioral response of piglets in anxiety tests. The study included 2 experiments, in the first one, 20 piglets from mothers who received enrichment and 20 from control sows were selected. Mothers of animals from the group with enrichment received stimulation during pregnancy and posteriorly piglets for 21 days. On post-natal day 22, animals were exposed to a novel object test and the day after to an elevated plus maze. Results showed that pigs with enrichment showed a lower number of escape attempts, and a greater latency to vocalizations. Likewise, control pigs performed fewer attempts to enter into open arms and risk assessment. In the second experiment, 60 piglets were divided into 4 groups: 1) received enrichment during pregnancy-lactation, 2) enrichment during weaning, 3) enrichment during pregnancy-lactation-weaning and 4) without enrichment. On post-natal day 70, pigs were exposed to an elevated plus maze. Results showed that pigs from group 1 showed less anxiety during the test compared with groups 3 and 4. This suggested that environmental enrichment during pregnancy-lactation positively impacted the ability of piglets to regulate anxiety.

AB  - Environmental enrichment effectively reduces anxiety-like indicators in animals, a potential co-treatment for diseases that generate variations in basal anxiety, such as alcoholism. Here we present an experimental design that allows investigating the effect of enrichment on anxiety-related behaviors using contextual aversive conditioning in zebrafish (Danio rerio). It was first observed whether animals conditioned with an aversive stimulus (electroshock paired with checked background tank) exhibited behavioral variations when previously held in barren (BE) or enriched (EE) environment. Enrichment reduced anxiety-like behaviors. Then, fish was exposed to four alcohol concentrations (0.00%, 0.10%, 0.50%, and 1.00%) after being held in BE or EE, and contextual fear conditioning was tested again. Fish showed dose-dependent and enrichment-related variation in anxiety-like behavior. Together, these results indicate that the experimental design in question is efficient in measuring behavior related to BE and EE, and that enrichment seems to impair the acquisition of dose-dependent effects of alcohol. Our results show that EE can alleviate deleterious effects caused by traumatic events, but it should also consider some effects of enrichment and alcohol exposure interaction.

AB  - Background Prenatal stress (PS) in experimental animals causes long-lasting changes in Purkinje cell dendritic morphology. Furthermore, these structural changes are associated with an increase in anxiogenic behaviors in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open-field (OF) test.
   Objectives As environmental enrichment (EE) has significant restorative effects on brain neurons and behavior, the aim of this study was to evaluate if postweaning EE mitigates the decrease in Purkinje cell dendritic expansion and exploratory behavior induced by PS in mice.
   Materials and Methods Restraint stress was induced from gestational day 14 (G14) to G21. Approximately 50% of the PS animals were submitted to the EE paradigm between postnatal days 22 (P22) and P52. At P52 and P82, male animals were behaviorally evaluated, and then the morphology of the cerebellar vermal Purkinje cells was analyzed.
   Results We found that EE significantly ameliorates the Purkinje cell dendritic atrophy and anxiety-like behavior in the EPM.
   Conclusion Our data show that long-lasting Purkinje cell dendritic impairments and anxiety-like behavior can be mitigated by postweaning EE.

AB  - Both social defeat stress and environmental enrichment stimulate adrenal glucocorticoid secretion, but they have opposing effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and mood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and decreased neurogenesis are consequences of social defeat. These outcomes are correlated with depressive states, but a causal role in the etiology of depression remains elusive. The antidepressant actions of environmental enrichment are neurogenesis-dependent, but the contribution of enrichment-elevated glucocorticoids is unexplored. Importantly, for both social defeat and environmental enrichment, how glucocorticoids interact with neurogenesis to alter mood is unknown. Here, we investigate causal roles of glucocorticoids and neurogenesis in induction of depressive-like behavior and its amelioration by environmental enrichment in mice. By blocking neurogenesis and surgically clamping adrenal hormone secretions, we showed that neurogenesis, via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis interactions, is directly involved in precipitating the depressive phenotype after social defeat. Mice adrenalectomized before social defeat showed enhanced behavioral resiliency and increased survival of adult-born hippocampal neurons compared with sham-operated defeated mice. However, mice lacking hippocampal neurogenesis did not show protective effects of adrenalectomy. Moreover, glucocorticoids secreted during environmental enrichment promoted neurogenesis and were required for restoration of normal behavior after social defeat. The data demonstrate that glucocorticoid-dependent declines in neurogenesis drive changes in mood after social defeat and that glucocorticoids secreted during enrichment promote neurogenesis and restore normal behavior after defeat. These data provide new evidence for direct involvement of neurogenesis in the etiology of depression, suggesting that treatments promoting neurogenesis can enhance stress resilience.

AB  - Exposure to adverse childhood experiences or early life stress experiences (ELSs) increase the risk of non-adaptive behaviors and psychopathology in adulthood. Environmental enrichment (EE) has been proposed to minimize these effects. The vast number of methodological variations in animal studies underscores the lack of systematicity in the studies and the need for a detailed understanding of how enrichment interacts with other variables. Here we evaluate the effects of environmental enrichment in male and female Wistar rats exposed to adverse early life experiences (prenatal, postnatal, and combined) on emotional (elevated plus maze), social (social interaction chamber), memory (Morris water maze) and flexibility tasks. Our results-collected from PND 51 to 64-confirmed: 1) the positive effect of environmental enrichment (PND 28-49) on anxiety-like behaviors in animals submitted to ELSs. These effects depended on type of experience and type of enrichment: foraging enrichment reduced anxiety-like behaviors in animals with prenatal and postnatal stress but increased them in animals without ELSs. This effect was sex-dependent: females showed lower anxiety compared to males. Our data also indicated that females exposed to prenatal and postnatal stress had lower anxious responses than males in the same conditions; 2) no differences were found for social interactions; 3) concerning memory, there was a significant interaction between the three factors: A significant interaction for males with prenatal stress was observed for foraging enrichment, while physical enrichment was positive for males with postnatal stress; d) regarding cognitive flexibility, a positive effect of EE was found in animals exposed to adverse ELSs: animals with combined stress and exposed to physical enrichment showed a higher index of cognitive flexibility than those not exposed to enrichment. Yet, within animals with no EE, those exposed to combined stress showed lower flexibility than those exposed to both prenatal stress and no stress. On the other hand, animals with prenatal stress and exposed to foraging-type enrichment showed lower cognitive flexibility than those with no EE. The prenatal stress-inducing conditions used here 5) did not induced fetal or maternal problems and 6) did not induced changes in the volume of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

AB  - Context Animals in situations of stress and constant fear exhibit unwanted behaviours for production. Pigs that are afraid of humans tend to associate any management as stressful. The use of environment enrichment for pigs may help to alleviate anxiety and fear, and hence reduce unwanted behaviours during handling. However, provision of appropriate enrichment presents challenges such as the rapid loss of interest in objects by animals. Aims The present study evaluated the effects of different environmental enrichment strategies on the behaviour of pigs at the nursery stage, maintenance of animal interest in the enrichment objects, and their reflexes when faced with emotionally negative situations. Methods Piglets (n= 425) were assigned in a completely randomised design with five treatments and five replicates per treatment (17 animal per replicate). The treatments employed were: control, no enriching objects in the environment; WB, wooden box with popcorn and wood shavings; PT, objects made of plastic tubing; WB and PT concurrently; and WB or PT on alternate days. Behavioural observations were made over 10 days for 8 h each day, divided into four periods of 2 h. Piglets from enriched (n= 10) and non-enriched (n= 10) environments were subjected to three fear tests (human approach, novel object and novel arena). Key results No significant (P> 0.05) effect was found for the type of enrichment provided or strategy adopted (concurrent vs alternating) on the time piglets interacted with the enrichment objects. Animals kept in an environment with no stimulus had higher frequency (P< 0.05) of undesirable behaviours than those with enrichment, regardless of enrichment type or strategy adopted. Piglets reared without enrichment, when isolated in a new environment, had higher frequency of behaviours such as defecating, urinating and attempting escape, as well as more and longer vocalisation events (P< 0.05). Piglets reared in an enriched environment had higher frequency and duration of interaction with a new object, as well as shorter latency time for the first contact with the object (P< 0.05). Conclusions The use of enrichment objects in the rearing environment of piglets at the nursery stage reduced undesirable behaviours, suggesting reduced fear and anxiety, and may therefore improve their psychological wellbeing. Implications Use of enrichment objects during rearing may have implications for alleviation of chronic stress, which leads to constant release of cortisol, an immune suppressor hormone that reduces the health status of the batch and hence production indices.

AB  - This study investigated how environmental structuring in the growing units of goat kids influences their ability to cope with social isolation and weaning-induced stress. Two experimental groups were arranged in an enriched (E) or barren (B) environment and each of the two groups had 10 female and 10 male kids. During the social isolation, the goat kids in group E started bleating earlier (P = 0.1612) and more frequently (P = 0.0125). Goat kids also bleated earlier (P = 0.0005) and more often after the weaning period (P = 0.0006). Only the rearing behavior of the groups exhibited significant differences in social isolation. However, after the weaning, kids showed more bipedal stance behavior (P = 0.0204) and less running behavior (P = 0.0394) than before the weaning period. Cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) hormone concentrations were lower at weaning than in the other periods with social isolation (P < 0.05). The T3 hormone concentrations of the groups at weaning were significantly different (P = 0.0201). The immune response to Brucella vaccination did not differ between the groups (P = 0.2753). Findings revealed that both social isolation tests created stress in the goat kids. Considering the bleating frequencies, it can be concluded that the goat kids in the enriched environment experienced more social isolation stress than the goat kids in the barren environment.

AB  - The medial-lateral habenula (LHbM)'s role in anxiety and depression behaviors in female mice remains unclear. Here, we used neonatal maternal deprivation (MD) and post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE) to treat female BALB/c offspring and checked anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors as well as the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), oxytocin receptor (OTR), estrogen receptor-beta (ER0) levels in their LHbM at adulthood. We found that MD enhanced state anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze test, and EE caused trait anxiety-like behaviors in the open field test and depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test. The immunochemistry showed that MD reduced OT immunoreactive neuron numbers in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus but increased OTR levels in the LHbM; EE increased CRH levels in the LHbM but decreased OTR levels in the LHbM. The additive effects of EE and MD maintained the behavioral parameters, OT-ir neuronal numbers, CRH levels, and OTR levels similar to the additive of non-MD and non-EE. The correlation analysis showed that CRH levels correlated with synaptic connection levels, OTR levels correlated with nucleus densities, and ER0 levels correlated with Nissl body levels and body weights in female mice. Neither MD nor EE affected ER0 levels in the LHbM. Together, the study revealed the relationships between behaviors and neuro-endocrine and neuronal alterations in female LHbM and the effects of experiences including MD and EE on them.

AB  - Exposure to early life stress results in behavioural changes, and these dysfunctions may persist throughout adulthood. In this study, we investigated whether hippocampus volume and neurochemical changes were involved in the appearance of these effects in the maternal separation (MS) animal model using the noninvasive techniques of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to MS for 180 min from postnatal days (PND) 2-14 demonstrated decreased sucrose preference, increased immobility in the forced swimming test (FST), and impaired memory in the Morris water maze in adulthood. Environmental enrichment (EE) (PND 21-60) could ameliorate the effects of MS on sucrose preference and learning and memory but not on immobility in the FST. In addition, EE significantly increased N-acetylaspartate (NAA) of MS animals. However, we did not find an effect of MS or EE on hippocampal volume. These results indicate the involvement of hippocampal neurochemistry in the behavioural changes that result from early stressful life events and their modification by post-weaning EE. Thus changes in NAA, as a measure of neuronal integrity, appear to be a sensitive correlate of these behavioural effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Environmental enrichment using music therapy can be used to improve animal welfare. Music, as an enrichment of the environment, is presented as an easy and viable way to remove the sterility of the breeding environment and make it more interesting and attractive. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of auditory environmental enrichment in the pre- and postpartum period of sows on the behavior, performance, and neuro-plasticity of their piglets. Exposure to music in the last 1/3 of pregnancy and farrowing/lactation improved the weight of piglets at birth and weaning. Musical enrichment during pregnancy and lactation was able to cause changes in the piglets' neuroplasticity and improve their productive performances. The rearing environment of pigs can cause a high level of stress due to the lack of stimuli and the impossibility of carrying out natural behaviors. Music therapy is a way to enrich the environment and promote stress relief. Few studies in swine using environmental enrichers focus on functional benefits, such as stress resilience, improved biological functions, or mental status. The effect of environmental enrichment on neurobiological processes is particularly poorly understood in farm animals. Thus, our study sought to elucidate the influence of music in piglets exposed to music therapy in the intrauterine and extrauterine phase on neuroplasticity, evaluating the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Behavioural responses were also evaluated using fear tests related to stress resilience. The productive performance of these piglets was analysed to relate the possible reduction in stress levels to greater productivity gains. Forty-eight sows were used at 90 days of gestation until the weaning of their piglets. In the gestation phase, the sows were divided into two treatments: control (without music therapy) and music (with music therapy). In the farrowing/lactation phase, the sows were separated into four treatments: control-control (no music in any phase); control-music (music only in farrowing/lactation); music-control (music only during pregnancy); and music-music (music in both reproductive phases). Music therapy did not cause a difference in the BDNF levels of piglets at birth. However, piglets born from sows of the music-music treatment did not show a reduction in BDNF between birth and weaning, unlike the other treatments. Exposure to music in the last 1/3 of pregnancy and farrowing/lactation improved the weight of piglets at birth and at weaning. Musical enrichment during pregnancy and lactation was able to cause changes in the piglets' neuroplasticity and improve their productive performances.

AB  - Many studies have shown that stress is associated with gut microbiota. Environmental enrichment (EE) could reduce stress in farm animals; however, limited information is available on the microbial community composition in rabbits raised with or without EE. This study aimed to identify EE influences on the behavior, serum hormonal levels, and cecal microbiota of rabbits. Two hundred Rex rabbits were segregated randomly within four cohorts (n = 50); reared for 76 d within standardized enclosures (non enriched) or within cages containing a willow-stick (WS), rubber-duck (RD), or a can of beans (CB). The rabbits' ingestive, rest, locomotion, exploratory, grooming, and abnormal behavior were observed. The serum hormone levels for rabbits were measured, and cecal specimens were sequencedfrom the V3-V4 region using 16S rRNA amplicons. Environmental enrichment increased feeding and drinking time, promoted exploratory behavior, and reduced abnormal behavior in rabbits. Insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) levels of the enriched cohorts were elevated in comparison to the control cohort. Serum cortisol level for CB cohort was markedly reduced in comparison to the control cohort (p < 0.05), while dopamine levels for CB cohort peaked. Further, we found that EE mainly affected the dominant microbiota. Several families, such as Erysipelotrichaceae, Tannerellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Prevotellaceae were markedly reduced within the CB cohort. Bacteria such as Alloprevotella, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Parabacteroides, and Erysipelatoclostridium were identified as having negative associations with the presence of serum cortisol. EE influenced rabbit behavior and serum hormonal levels, and CB enrichment was the most suitable for rabbits. Further, cecal microbiota composition and diversity were affected by CB enrichment. These findings suggested that CB could be considered for use in rabbit husbandry.

AB  - Neurogenesis persists in certain regions of the adult brain including the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus wherein its regulation is essential, particularly in relation to learning, stress and modulation of mood. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an extracellular signaling phospholipid with important neural regulatory properties mediated by specific G protein-coupled receptors, LPA(1-5). LPA(1) is highly expressed in the developing neurogenic ventricular zone wherein it is required for normal embryonic neurogenesis, and, by extension may play a role in adult neurogenesis as well. By means of the analyses of a variant of the original LPA(1)-null mutant mouse, termed the Malaga variant or "maLPA(1)-null," which has recently been reported to have defective neurogenesis within the embryonic cerebral cortex, we report here a role for LPA(1) in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Proliferation, differentiation and survival of newly formed neurons are defective in the absence of LPA(1) under normal conditions and following exposure to enriched environment and voluntary exercise. Furthermore, analysis of trophic factors in maLPA(1)-null mice demonstrated alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin growth factor 1 levels after enrichment and exercise Morphological analyses of doublecortin positive cells revealed the anomalous prevalence of bipolar. cells in the subgranular zone, supporting the operation of LPA(1) signaling pathways in normal proliferation, maturation and differentiation of neuronal precursors.

AB  - Stress vulnerability could influence the treatment response to anxiety associated with abrupt hormonal suppression. The present study explored the effects of different treatments on experimental anxiety induced by progesterone withdrawal (PW) in a stress-sensitive rat strain, Wistar Kyoto (WKY), in the burying behavior test (BBT). The following experimental series was conducted using independent groups of Wistar (control strain) and WKY ovariectomized rats: Experiment 1: Rats were treated for 5 days with oil, a constant dose of progesterone (0.5 mg/rat, s.c) or a combination of progesterone (0.5 mg/rat, s.c) plus fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p); on day 6, all rats were subjected to BBT. Experiment 2: Rats received corn oil or decreasing doses of progesterone (0.84, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33 and 0.17 mg/rat; one dose daily); on day 6, the rats were subjected to BBT. Experiment 3: Rats were divided into two groups that were subjected to 30 days of standard conditions or environmental enrichment (EE); from days 25 to 30, all rats received a fixed dose of progesterone (0.5 mg/rat, s.c.) or vehicle. On day 31, the rats were tested with BBT. Results showed that PW increased anxiety in both strains, and fluoxetine prevented anxiety in WKY rats. In contrast, a gradual reduction of progesterone prevents the anxiety in Wistar but not in WKY. EE was preventive against the anxiety induced by PW in both strains of rats. Thus, the results suggest that anxiety induced by PW is prevented by EE while the anxiolytic effect of pharmacological treatments depends on stress vulnerability. (C) 2016 IBRO.

AB  - The inhibitory avoidance paradigm allows the study of mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation in zebrafish (Danio rerio Hamilton). For zebrafish, the physiology and behavior associated with this paradigm are as yet poorly understood. We therefore assessed the effects of environmental enrichment and fish age on inhibitory avoidance learning. Fish raised in an environmentally enriched tank showed decreased anxiety-like behavior and increased exploration. Enrichment greatly reduced inhibitory avoidance in 6-month (6M)- and 12-month (12M)-old fish. Following inhibitory avoidance, telencephalic mRNA levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), neurogenic differentiation (neurod), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript 4 (cart4), and cannabinoid receptor 1 (cnr1) were lower in enriched-housed fish, while the ratios of mineralocorticoid receptor (nr3c2)/glucocorticoid receptor alpha [nr3c1(alpha)] and glucocorticoid receptor beta [nr3c1(beta)]/glucocorticoid receptor alpha [nr3c1(alpha)] were higher. This was observed for 6M-old fish only, not for 24-month (24M) old fish. Instead, 24M-old fish showed delayed inhibitory avoidance, no effects of enrichment, and reduced expression of neuroplasticity genes. Overall, our data show strong differences in inhibitory avoidance behavior between zebrafish of different ages and a clear reduction in avoidance behavior following housing under environmental enrichment.

AB  - Early enrichment (EE) programs provide a well-established approach to mitigate the deleterious effects of childhood adversity. To better understand the therapeutic features of EE, in the current study we compared the effect of two forms of nesting material on isolation reared (IR) rats. We found that both materials, absent of social and any other physical enrichment, significantly improved wound healing rates. The results suggest that this animal model may provide useful insights into the critical components of EE. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental model which is believed to counteract some of the effects induced by stressors, although few studies have exposed rodents simultaneously to EE and stress. Our aim was to compare the short- and long-term effects of different housing conditions in mice submitted to chronic stress. 128 NMRI male mice arrived at our laboratory on postnatal day (PND) 21. During Phase I (PND 28), animals were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions: 1) EE + STRESS: mice housed in EE and submitted to social stress (n = 32); 2) EE + NO STRESS: mice housed in EE without stress (n = 32); 3) SE + STRESS: mice maintained in standard conditions (SE) and submitted to social stress (n = 32); and 4) SE + NO STRESS (n = 32). At the end of Phase I (PND 77), one cohort of 32 animals was used for behavioral assessment whereas another cohort of 32 was sacrificed for corticosterone analysis. Results indicated that EE animals showed less body weight, higher water and food intake, diminished anxiety response and decreased motor and exploratory behavior than SE mice. Mice exposed to stress gained less body weight, showed higher food and fluid intake and displayed decreased exploratory behavior than non-stressed mice. Furthermore, EE + STRESS group displayed significantly higher corticosterone levels than EE + NO STRESS group whereas EE + NO STRESS group showed lower levels than SE + NO STRESS. On PND 83, Phase II of the study began. Animals (n = 96) were assigned to two different housing conditions: EE (n = 48) and SE (n = 48). On PND 112, corticosterone analysis (n = 32) and behavioral study (n = 64) were done. The factor "Housing Phase II" reached statistical significance. Results indicated that EE animals showed lower body weight and higher fluid intake than SE group, as well as decreased anxiety. No clear effects on motor and exploratory behavior or learning were observed. When long-term effects were analyzed, results indicated that "Initial Housing" condition was significant: animals allocated in EE during Phase I of the study showed higher corticosterone levels, lower body weight and higher fluid intake than SE mice. "Initial Stress" had significant long-term actions on food intake and exploratory behavior: animals initially reared under stress conditions displayed higher food intake and lower exploration levels on the hole-board test than non-stressed mice. In the elevated plus-maze, there were significant interactions between factors "Initial Housing" and "Initial Stress". These factors did not reach statistical significance for motor activity or learning task. We can conclude that both short- and long-term effects of housing conditions are evident for corticosterone levels, body weight and fluid intake. Social stress induced short-term effects on body weight, food and fluid intake and exploratory behavior whereas long-acting effects were reflected on food intake and exploratory behavior. Further studies are needed in order to explore more in depth behavioral and physiological consequences of social stress and environmental enrichment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little attention has been directed towards environmental control of sensitivity to natural reward and its possible relationship with other motivated behaviors, besides the well-known effects of environmental enrichment and social isolation on drug self-administration and locomotor sensitization to psychostimulants. Here, we investigate the effects of these rearing conditions on sucrose consumption and preference, and tissue levels of striatal dopamine. The possible relationship among sucrose intake, immobility behavior in the forced swimming test, and dopamine concentration was explored through correlation and regression analyses. Even though all animals preferred sucrose over water, we found, that during postnatal period, isolated rats consumed more sucrose than control or enriched littermates. In isolated Fats sucrose intake correlated positively with ventral but not with dorsal striatum dopamine, even when striatal dopamine did not differ among groups. Especially in isolated animals immobility behavior was positively predicted by differences in sucrose intake. The dopamine concentration did not correlate with immobility behavior. Taken together, the present data support previous findings regarding the effects of early life events upon reward-sensitivity and depressive-like behavior, and also provide further evidence about the relationship between these motivated behaviors and the likely role of ventral striatum dopamine in regulating them.

AB  - Background: Neonatal maternal separation (NMS) can lead to visceral pain and anxiety-and depression -like behaviors. An enriched environment (EE) can alleviate NMS-induced pain and mental disorders, but previous studies have mostly been performed in male animals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the effects of EE were sex dependent at different stages of development.Methods: Female and Male C57BL/6 J mice that had been subjected to NMS alone and those subjected to both NMS and exposed to EE were used in this study. The visceral pain threshold test (PTT), open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), and forced swimming test (FST) were conducted to evaluate visceral pain, anxiety-like behavior, and depression-like behavior in mice, respectively.Results: Compared with the male mice in the NMS group without EE exposure, those exposed to EE from postnatal day (P)21 to 41 showed an increase of the visceral pain threshold in the PTT, an increase of the central time and central distance in the OFT, an increase of the sucrose preference rate in the SPT, and a decrease of the time of immobility in the FST. Compared with both female and male mice in the NMS group without EE exposure, those exposed to EE from P21 to P61 had an increase of the visceral pain threshold in the PTT, an increase of the central time and central distance in the OFT, an increase in the sucrose preference rate in the SPT, and a decrease of the time of immobility in the FST.Conclusions: EE is more effective in male NMS mice, while longer EE is required in female NMS mice for positive effects.

AB  - Enriched environmental condition (EC) has been known to reduce anxiety. In this study, we examined whether an EC could enhance anxiolytic behavior in the Indian field mouse Mus booduga by down-regulating the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) through microRNA-124a. Wild individuals were captured at agricultural field, and then housed at standard conditions (SC) for 7 days. After short-term at standard condition (STSC), on 8th day they were divided into three groups as those: (i) STSC mice tested on light/dark box on the same day and then euthanized to examine gene expression, (ii) maintained at long-term in standard condition (LTSC) and (iii) transferred to EC. After 30 days, both the LTSC and EC groups were tested on the light/dark box and then euthanized to examine gene expression in amygdala region of brain. EC group preferred to stay at light chamber and exhibited less anxiety-like behavioral components when compared to STSC and LTSC groups. However, between the two groups the STSC mice showed lesser anxiety-like behavior than LTSC mice. The expression of Dicer, Ago-2 and microRNA-124a (miR-124a) was more significantly up regulated in EC mice than in STSC and LTSC mice. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that miR-124a binds with 3'UTR of GR, and subsequently we detected a more decreased level of GR in EC than in STSC, LTSC mice. The results suggest that one of the action of EC could be a GR fine tuning through miR-124a, but there is no demonstration that it could be the only involved molecular mechanism.

AB  - Early-life experiences, including parental care, affect cognitive performance later in life. Being exposed to early-life maternal separation (MS) increases susceptibility to stress-related psychopathology. Previous studies suggest that MS could induce learning and memory impairments. Since enriched environment (EE) provides more opportunities for exploration and social interaction, in the present study we evaluated the effects of a short EE paradigm with a duration of 13 days on cognitive abilities of maternally separated rats (MS; 180 min/day, postnatal day (PND) 1-21) during adolescence in four experimental groups: Control, Control+EE, MS, and MS+EE. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were also measured in experimental animals. We also studied the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the slices of hippocampal CA1 area. The behavioral and electrophysiological assessments were started at PND 35. MS caused higher basal CORT levels in plasma and impaired spatial learning, memory, and social interaction. LTP induction was also impaired in MS rats and plasma BDNF levels were reduced in these animals. MS also induced more anxiety-like behavior. Short EE reduced plasma CORT levels had the potential to improve locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in MS+EE rats and reversed MS-induced impairments of spatial learning, memory, and social behavior. LTP induction and plasma BDNF levels were also enhanced in MS+EE rats. We concluded that short EE might be considered as a therapeutic strategy for promoting cognition.

AB  - Rats were housed after weaning in isolation, with a same-sex sibling, or in a group in an enriched environment for 60 days. Then, subjects were trained to consume all of their fluids during a daily 2-h drinking session, habituated to drinking solutions of both d-amphetamine sulfate and sodium barbital, and then given a choice between drinking water, the stimulant amphetamine and the depressant barbital. Drug choice was affected by both sex and previous housing condition. Males raised in social isolation preferred the stimulant, while females raised in isolation preferred the depressant. Both males and females raised in enriched environments expressed no drug preference, and had the lowest overall drug intake. These results suggest that individual differences in rates of initiation, choice of abusing agent, and maintenance of drug self-administration may be partially determined by pre-existing differences in central nervous system functioning due to early experiences. Differential early experience, particularly the stress of social isolation, can influence drug self-administration behavior, but the effect may be sex-dependent.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The zebrafish is one of the most commonly used animals in scientific research, but there remains a lack of consensus over good practice for zebrafish housing and care. One such area which lacks agreement is whether laboratory zebrafish should be provided with environmental enrichment-additions or modifications to the basic laboratory environment which aim to improve welfare, such as plastic plants in tanks. The need for the provision of appropriate environmental enrichment has been recognised in other laboratory animal species, but some scientists and animal care staff are hesitant to provide enrichment for zebrafish, arguing that there is little or no evidence that enrichment can benefit zebrafish welfare. This review aims to summarise the current literature on the effects of enrichment on zebrafish physiology, behaviour and welfare, and identifies some forms of enrichment which are likely to benefit zebrafish. It also considers the possible challenges that might be associated with introducing more enrichment, and how these might be addressed.
   Good practice for the housing and care of laboratory zebrafish Danio rerio is an increasingly discussed topic, with focus on appropriate water quality parameters, stocking densities, feeding regimes, anaesthesia and analgesia practices, methods of humane killing, and more. One area of current attention is around the provision of environmental enrichment. Enrichment is accepted as an essential requirement for meeting the behavioural needs and improving the welfare of many laboratory animal species, but in general, provision for zebrafish is minimal. Some of those involved in the care and use of zebrafish suggest there is a 'lack of evidence' that enrichment has welfare benefits for this species, or cite a belief that zebrafish do not 'need' enrichment. Concerns are also sometimes raised around the practical challenges of providing enrichments, or that they may impact on the science being undertaken. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that various forms of enrichment are preferred by zebrafish over a barren tank, and that enriched conditions can improve welfare by reducing stress and anxiety. This review explores the effects that enrichment can have on zebrafish behaviour, physiology and welfare, and considers the challenges to facilities of providing more enrichment for the zebrafish they house.

AB  - The Turquoise-fronted Amazon Amazona aestiva is one of the most extensively poached species as a result of illegal trade in Brazil. Reintroduction programs have been increasingly used in the management of these animals in captivity. Several preparatory procedures should be carried out during the pre-release period to characterize the group of animals and subsequently increase the success of reintroduction programs. The most important procedures are temperament assessment and environmental enrichment training, which is expected to influence the behavior of the released birds. This study aimed to assess the temperament of the amazons in captivity and its influence on a reintroduction program. The temperaments of 50 parrots were classified from shy to bold and monitored during five phases of activity throughout the study: environmental enrichment training in captivity, a period of acclimatization in an aviary placed in the release area, the offer of fruit from the release region, dependence on the aviary after it was opened, and post-release food supplementation. Once the animals were released, they were monitored for 18 months. Temperament assessment supported the reintroduction project, because through this information it was possible to predict the individual behaviors of reintroduced animals when dealing with environmental challenges. The purpose of the pre-release environmental enrichment training was to encourage individual amazons to increase exploratory behaviors, and was effective in enhancing the natural behavior of the species and reducing stereotypies. Animals classified as shy required a longer intervention period to achieve the same results since they exhibited greater dependence on the aviary and, consequently, took longer to explore the release area. In the medium term, no significant difference was observed between shy and bold parrots in their departure after opening the aviary, use of supplementary feeding, or survival. Therefore, the activities performed prior to release adequately promoted similar habituation conditions for both profiles.

AB  - Employing environmental enrichment (EE) provides continual sources of dynamic interaction for animals. Though an established discipline in behavioural science, the consequences of EE on behavioural pharmacological tests have not been extensively examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the consequences of EE (or isolation housing) on a range of behavioural pharmacological tests and brain monoamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the rat. Male rats were randomly assigned to IC (isolation), SC (standard group-housed) or EE conditions. IC and SC animals were housed singly or in groups of four in standard cages, whilst the EE group were housed in groups of four in larger cages enriched with a variety of wooden, cardboard and plastic objects. After 5 weeks of housing, its impact on the effects of diazepam (DZP) in the elevated plus maze (EPM); desipramine (DMI) in the forced swim test (FST) and amphetamine (AMP) effects on homecage activity were assessed. Post-mortem monoamine and BDNF levels were analysed using HPLC and ELISA. EE rats displayed reduced activity in the OFT, however no other differences were found in baseline behaviours. DMI reduced immobility time in the FST, but only for rats housed in IC, while AMP effects were somewhat greater for socially-housed animals than those in IC. There were no housing effects on monoamine or BDNF levels in discreet brain regions. The results suggest that post-weaning enrichment had no significant effect on baseline behaviours or monoamine and BDNF levels, thus it is suitable to implement as a commonplace husbandry practice, however, caution must be taken when investigating responsiveness to psychotropic drugs.

AB  - Neuropeptides have an important role in several psychiatric conditions. Among them, neuropeptide Y (NPY) seems to be essential to modulate some features of stress-related disorders. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by inappropriate fear generalization to safe situations may be modulated by NPY manipulation since this neuropeptide is involved in the promotion of coping with stress. Experimentally, coping strategies have been obtained after exposure in enriched environment (EE) rather than standard one. Thus, in the present study we aimed to assess whether short-term EE situation and NPY-Y1 receptor (Y1r) modulation may affect the extinction of contextual fear conditioning, an experimental approach to PTSD. Here we show that EE-rats have the contextual fear extinction facilitated, and this facilitation was reverted by central infusion of BIB03304, a nonpeptide Y1r antagonist. In addition, protein analysis revealed an upregulation of hippocampal Y1r in conditioned EE-rats, but no changes were observed in EE-rats that were not conditioned. Our results demonstrated that protective properties of EE on fear extinction can be regulated, at least in part, by activation of NPY-signaling through Y1r within hippocampus, an area that plays a major role in contextual memories. Overall, the activation of Y1r is important to promote better and faster perception of self-location (context), and to reduce fear generalization in rats exposed to EE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The environmental enrichment (EE) and the aerobic exercise (EX) are interventions capable of reducing anxiety levels in the aging, but few is known about how they modulating the projections to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). We studied the effect of an EE and EX programs carried out during two months in 18 month-old Wistar rats assigned to 3 groups: (CO, N=6), EE (N=8) y EX (N=8). The EX program was carried out during 15min/day and the EE group was housed in a big cage with different objects frequently changed. Through the cytochrome c oxidase histochemistry (COx), we analysed the metabolic activity of several brain regions involved in the anxiety response. The EE reduced the brain activity of regions involved in the activation of the HPA axis (infralimbic cortex, basolateral amygdala and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (p<0.05). On the other hand, the EX program increased the activity of brain regions involved in the inhibition of the HPA axis (cingulate cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the dorsal hippocampus (p<0.05). In conclusion, it seemed that the EE and the EX modulate in different way the activity of brain regions that project to the HPA axis and they could constitute successful interventions to reduce the anxiety levels in the aging.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of both environmental enrichment and individual behavioural characteristics on spatial cognitive capabilities of pigs, using a novel latent spatial learning paradigm based on Tolman's detour experiments (1948). Pigs were housed either in 'barren' pens or in pens enriched with straw bedding from birth. Pigs were restrained in a Backtest at 10 and 17 days postpartum. Based on their escape behaviour in this test, which has been shown to reflect their behavioural style, six 'high-resisting'(HR) and six 'low-resisting' (LR) pigs were selected from each housing environment (n = 24 in total). At 12 weeks of age, pairs of pen mates (LR and HR) were exposed to a maze three times (exploration trials). Pigs were then placed individually in the maze, and social reinstatement proved to be a strong incentive to find the exit leading to the home pen. We subsequently blocked the direct route to the exit, forcing animals to find a detour (memory test 1, MT1). This test was repeated once to investigate the relative improvement, i.e. detour learning (memory test 2, MT2). Housing condition and Backtest response strongly affected exploration patterns. In spite of this, no effects on performance during the subsequent memory tests were found. Performance was substantially improved in MT2, indicating that once a goal is apparent, pigs are able to solve a complex spatial memory task easily. In conclusion, social reinstatement provided a good incentive to complete a spatial task, and the substantial improvement in performance between MT1 and MT2 stresses the need for task complexity when testing spatial memory in pigs. Housing conditions or individual behavioural style did not affect spatial memory during MT1 or MT2. However, housing environment and behavioural style strongly affected explorative behaviour of pigs in an unfamiliar maze during both exploration trials and memory tests. This implicates that apparent effects of environmental enrichment on spatial learning and memory in pigs might reflect differences in explorative patterns rather than in cognitive processes.

AB  - The role of mBDNF on the beneficial effects of cognitive stimulation on the brain remains controversial, as well as the potential of peripheral mBDNF as a biomarker of environmental effects on its central status. We investigated the effect of different environmental conditions on recognition memory, proBDNF, mBDNF and synaptophysin levels in the hippocampus, and on mBDNF levels in blood. Male Wistar rats (6 and 17 months-old) were assigned to cognitively enriched (EE), standard (SE) and impoverished (IE) environmental conditions for twelve weeks. Novel object recognition was performed at week 10. When the animals were 9 and 20-months old, hippocampus was collected for mBDNF, proBDNF and synaptophysin analysis; serum was analyzed for mBDNF levels. The cognitively EE improved recognition memory, resulted in a trend to increased hippocampal mBDNF and augmented synaptophysin levels. Accordingly, hippocampal mBDNF, proBDNF and synaptophysin were significantly higher in EE than IE animals. Hippocampal mBDNF was positively correlated to proBDNF, cellular and behavioral plasticity markers. No effect of age was seen on the studied variables. Moreover, no significant effects of EE or IE on serum mBDNF were observed. Serum mBDNF also failed to correlate with hippocampal mBDNF, proBDNF and with the cellular and behavioral plasticity markers. These findings indicate that mBDNF is involved in neuronal and behavioral plasticity mechanisms induced by cognitively enriched environments, and that peripheral mBDNF may not always be a reliable biomarker of the effects of environmental settings on central mBDNF and plasticity, which is of special interest from a translational research perspective.

AB  - Early life experiences can affect brain development, contributing to shape interindividual differences in stress vulnerability and anxiety-like behavior. In rodents, high levels of maternal care have long-lasting positive effects on the behavior of the offspring and stress response; post-weaning rearing in an enriched environment (EE) or massage counteract the negative effects of maternal separation or prenatal stressors. We recently found that insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) is a key mediator of early EE or massage on brain development. Whether early enrichment of experience can induce long-lasting effects on anxiety-like behavior and whether IGF-1 is involved in these effects is not known. We assessed anxiety-like behavior by means of the elevated plus maze in control adult rats and in adult rats subjected to early EE or to massage. We found that both EE and massage reduced adult anxiety-like behavior. Early IGF-1 systemic injections in rat pups reared in standard condition mimic the effects of EE and massage, reducing anxiety-like behavior in the adult; blocking early IGF-1 action in massaged and EE animals prevents massage and EE effects. In EE and IGF-1-treated animals, we assessed the hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) at postnatal day 12 (P12) and P60, finding a significantly higher GR expression at P60 for both treatments. These results suggest that IGF-1 could be involved in mediating the long-lasting effects of early life experiences on vulnerability/resilience to stress in adults.

AB  - This paper summarises recent findings on the causation of stereotypic behaviours and other abnormal repetitive behaviours (ARBs) in captive animals: primarily motivational frustration and/or brain dysfunction, with possible contributory roles also being played by habit-formation and 'coping' effects. We then review the extent to which ARBs occur in zoos and similar, estimating that at least 10 000 captive wild animals are affected worldwide. We argue for 'zero tolerance' of such ARBs, because stress and poor welfare raise ethical issues, while abnormal behavioural phenotypes and possibilities of impaired brain development challenge both the indirect (e.g. educational) and the direct, intrinsic conservation value of affected animals. We then consider five potential means by which ARBs may be tackled: genetic selection; pharmacological treatment; the reinforcement of alternative behaviours; punishment; and environmental enrichment. All except punishment have potentially useful roles to play, but enrichment is the preferred approach: it is most likely to tackle the problems underlying stereotypic behaviours, and thence to improve both welfare and behaviour with few unwanted side-effects. Nevertheless, in zoos, environmental enrichment to date has only had partial success, with no study managing to abolish ARBs in all its subjects-suggesting either that the enrichments currently being used are never quite optimal, or that by the time they are tackled, ARBs have become resistant to change. We suggest some ways in which the effectiveness of enrichments may be enhanced; propose that certain properties of ARBs may usefully help evaluate their likely 'treatability'; and emphasise that if improving welfare is more important than just reducing ARB, then additional measures are needed in order to first, reliably identify those individuals most at risk from poor welfare, and then, to fully evaluate the welfare impact of enrichments. This paper also emphasises, with examples, the enormous potential value of zoo-derived data for helping understand how taxon, ecological niche, rearing history, and current housing together affect animals' responses to captivity.

AB  - The brain is able to change its structure and function in response to environmental stimulations. Several human and animal studies have documented that enhanced stimulations provide individuals with strengthened brain structure and function that allow them to better cope with damage. In this framework, studies based on the exposure of animals to environmental enrichment (EE) have provided indications of the mechanisms involved in such a beneficial action. The cerebellum is a very plastic brain region that responds to every experience with deep structural and functional rearrangement. The present review specifically aims to collect and synthesize the evidence provided by animal models on EE exposure effects on cerebellar structure and function by considering the studies on healthy subjects and on animals exposed to EE both before and after damage involving cerebellar functionality. On the whole, the evidence supports the role of EE in enhancing cerebellar compensation and developing cerebellar reserve. However, since studies addressing this issue are still scarce, large areas of inconsistency and lack of clarity remain. Further studies are required to provide suggestions on possible mechanisms of enhancement of compensatory responses in human patients following cerebellar damage.

AB  - Background Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves quality of life of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder characterized by chronic visceral pain and abnormal bowel habits. Whether CBT can actually improve visceral pain in IBS patients is still unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether environment enrichment (EE), the animal analog of CBT, can prevent stress-induced viscero-somatic hypersensitivity through changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA).
   Methods Rats were housed in either standard housing (SH) or EE for 7 days before and during daily water avoidance stress (WAS) exposure (1-h/d for 7 days). In the first cohort, visceral and somatic sensitivity were assessed via visceromotor response to colorectal distention and von Frey Anesthesiometer 24 hous and 21 days after WAS. In another cohort, the CeA was isolated for GR mRNA quantification.
   Key Results Environment enrichment for 7 days before and during the 7 days of WAS persistently attenuated visceral and somatic hypersensitivity when compared to rats placed in SH. Environment enrichment exposure also prevented the WAS-induced decrease in GR expression in the CeA.
   Conclusion & Inferences Pre-exposure to short-term EE prevents the stress-induced downregulation of GR, and inhibits visceral and somatic hypersensitivity induced by chronic stress. These results suggest that a positive environment can ameliorate stress-induced pathology and provide a non-pharmacological therapeutic option for disorders such as IBS.

AB  - Background: Neonatal maternal separation (NMS) is a major early life stress that can induce visceral pain and mental disorders. We have shown that an enriched environment (EE) can alleviate NMS-induced negative effects, but the time window over which EE works is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the time window through which EE alleviates NMS-induced visceral pain, anxiousness, and depressive behaviors.Methods: In this study, we used male C57BL/6J mice. The mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, NMS group, prepubertal EE group (EE1 group), pubertal EE group (EE2 group), and adult EE group (EE3 group). The visceral pain threshold test (PTT), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT) were performed in all five groups to assay visceral pain, anxiety-, and depression-like behaviors in mice, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for corticosterone was performed in all five groups to assess the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.Results: There was no significant change in weight between groups. It was shown that NMS induced visceral pain, anxiety, and depression, and EE1 and EE2 reversed these negative effects, but EE3 had no significant effect. Likewise, EE1 and EE2 reversed the NMS-induced increase of corticosterone, but EE3 did not.Conclusions: Adverse life experiences in early life can lead to visceral pain, anxiety, and depression in adulthood, which can be effectively prevented by EE interventions in prepuberty and puberty.

AB  - Adverse early experience is generally regarded as a risk factor for both externalizing and internalizing behavioral disorders in humans. It can be modeled in rats by a post-weaning social isolation procedure. Effects of social isolation might possibly be ameliorated by environmental enrichment. In the current study, 24 male Wistar rats were divided post-weaning into four rearing conditions: control, environmental enrichment (EE), social isolation (SI) and a combination of the two experimental conditions; (EE+SI). Two observations of the effects of rearing conditions on the rate of social and object interactions were conducted during the juvenile and post-pubertal stages of development. The SI condition led to a marked increase of social interactions during the juvenile phase, but did not affect object interactions. The BE condition increased the level of social interactions during both the juvenile and post-pubertal measurements. The effects of early rearing conditions on adult exploratory behavior were less clear, with a significant difference between the groups obtained in one of three behavioral tests. Results suggest a general robustness in the development of adult exploratory behavior and anxiety when rats were exposed to early social isolation and provided brief opportunities for social play during the juvenile period. Further studies, aimed at distinguishing play-related protective factors serving against long-term adverse effects of juvenile social isolation, are suggested.

AB  - The continuum of physiological anxiety up to psychopathology is not merely dependent on genes, but is orchestrated by the interplay of genetic predisposition, gene x environment and epigenetic interactions. Accordingly, inborn anxiety is considered a polygenic, multifactorial trait, likely to be shaped by environmentally driven plasticity at the genomic level. We here took advantage of the extreme genetic predisposition of the selectively bred high (HAB) and low anxiety (LAB) mouse model exhibiting high vs low anxiety-related behavior and tested whether and how beneficial (enriched environment) vs detrimental (chronic mild stress) environmental manipulations are capable of rescuing phenotypes from both ends of the anxiety continuum. We provide evidence that (i) even inborn and seemingly rigid behavioral and neuroendocrine phenotypes can bidirectionally be rescued by appropriate environmental stimuli, (ii) corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1), critically involved in trait anxiety, shows bidirectional alterations in its expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) upon environmental stimulation, (iii) these alterations are linked to an increased methylation status of its promoter and, finally, (iv) binding of the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) to the Crhr1 promoter contributes to its gene expression in a methylation-sensitive manner. Thus, Crhr1 in the BLA is critically involved as plasticity gene in the bidirectional epigenetic rescue of extremes in trait anxiety.

AB  - Background: Previous research has shown that rats reared in an enriched condition (EC) are more sensitive to the acute effects of amphetamine than rats reared in an isolated condition (IC);yet, EC rats self-administer less amphetamine than IC rats. The present study used cocaine to further explore this environmental enrichment behavioral phenotype, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.
   Methods: Enriched condition and IC rats were studied in a broad battery of behavioral tests, including cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration and several measures of anxiety- and depression-related behavior. The involvement of the transcription factor, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), in mediating EC versus IC differences was investigated.
   Results: Enriched condition rats exhibited less cocaine self-administration, despite showing enhanced cocaine CIPP. Enriched condition rats also displayed less depression-like behavior but higher levels of anxiety-like behavior. This behavioral phenotype is consistent with low CREB activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region. Indeed, EC rats have less phospho-CREB (the transcriptionally active form of the protein) in the nucleus accumbens than IC rats, and a selective knockdown of CREB in this brain region of normally reared rats, by use of a novel viral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against CREB, reproduced the EC behavioral phenotype.
   Conclusions: These studies identify a potential molecular mechanism for how rearing environment-a nonpharmacological, nonsurgical manipulation-can modify a wide range of complex emotional behaviors.

AB  - Age-associated changes in cognition are mirrored by impairments in cellular models of memory and learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In young rodents, environmental enrichment (EE) can enhance memory, alter LTP and LTD, as well as reverse cognitive deficits induced by aging. Whether short-term EE can benefit cognition and synaptic plasticity in aged rodents is unclear. Here, we tested if short-term EE could overcome age-associated impairments in induction of LTP and LTD. LTP and LTD could not be induced in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices in control, aged rats using standard stimuli that are highly effective in young rats. However, exposure of aged littermates to EE for three weeks enabled successful induction of LTP and LTD. EE-facilitated LTP was dependent upon N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). These alterations in synaptic plasticity occurred with elevated levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein and vascular endothelial growth factor, but in the absence of changes in several other synaptic and cellular markers. Importantly, our study suggests that even a relatively short period of EE is sufficient to alter synaptic plasticity and molecular markers linked to cognitivefunction in aged animals. (C) 2016 IBRO.

AB  - Most animals, including rats, show a preference for more complex environments. This is demonstrated particularly well when complexity increases due to the addition of new elements to the environment. The aim of the study was to investigate the reaction to novelty, understood as a change in environmental properties that involve both changes in complexity and controllability. Controllability may allow for dealing with challenges of an environment of low predictability in a way that the animal's own activity reduces the uncertainty of environmental events. In our study, the animals underwent a spontaneous exploration test in low-stress conditions. After a period of habituation to the experimental arena, additional stationary (increased complexity) and/or movable (increased complexity and controllability) tunnels were introduced, and the reaction of the rats to the novel objects was measured. The results of the study confirmed that an increase in the complexity of the environment through the addition of objects triggers a more intensive exploratory activity in rats. However, an increased spatial complexity combined with the movability of the novel objects seems to result in increased caution towards the novelty after an initial inspection of the changed objects. It suggests that the complexity of the novelty may trigger both neophilia and neophobia depending on the level of the predictability of the novel environment and that the movability of newly introduced objects is not independent of other parameters of the environment.

AB  - Preterm babies treated with synthetic glucocorticoids in utero exhibit behavioural alterations and disturbances in brain maturation during postnatal life. Accordingly, it has been shown in preclinical studies that SGC exposure at a clinical dose alters the presynaptic and postsynaptic structures and results in synaptic impairments. However, the precise mechanism by which SGC exposure impairs synaptic protein expression and its implications are not fully elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of prenatal exposure to a clinical dose of betamethasone on the pre- and postsynaptic proteins expression in the developing rat cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, whose synchronized synaptic activity is crucial for motor control and learning.
   Consequently, the first objective of the present study was to determine whether prenatal betamethasone -equivalent to the clinically used dose- alters cerebellar vermal and cortical expression of synaptophysin, synaptotagmin I, post-synaptic density protein 95 and gephyrin- four important pre- and post-synaptic proteins, respectively- at a relevant adolescent stage. In addition, our second objective was to assess whether prenatal betamethasone administration induced coordination impairment using a rotarod test.
   On the other hand, it has been shown that the environmental enrichment is capable of improving synaptic transmission and recovering various behavioural impairments. Nevertheless, there is not enough information about the effect of this non-pharmacological preclinical approach on the regulation of this cerebellar and cortical synaptic proteins. Therefore, the third objective of this study was to examine whether environmental enrichment exposure could recover the possible molecular and behavioural impairments in the offspring at the same developmental stage.
   The principal data showed that adolescent rats prenatally treated with betamethasone exhibited under expression of synaptophysin in the vermal cerebellum, but not change in levels of synaptotagmin I, post-synaptic density protein 95 and gephyrin. Analysis of the same pre- and post-synaptic proteins no showed differences in the frontal cortex of the same rats. These results were accompanied by an increase in the number of falls in the rotarod test, when the speed of rotation was fixed and when it was in acceleration, which means motor coordination impairments. Importantly, we found that environmental enrichment restores the betamethasone-induced reduction in the cerebellar synaptophysin together with a recover in the motor coordination impairments in prenatally betamethasone-exposed adolescent rats.

AB  - Background Pathological anxiety originates from a complex interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, acting via epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic processes that can counteract detrimental genetic risk towards innate high anxiety are not well characterized.
   Methods We used female mouse lines of selectively bred high (HAB)- vs low (LAB)-innate anxiety-related behavior and performed select environmental and pharmacological manipulations to alter anxiety levels as well as brain-specific manipulations and immunohistochemistry to investigate neuronal mechanisms associated with alterations in anxiety-related behavior.
   Results Inborn hyperanxiety of high anxiety-like phenotypes was effectively reduced by environmental enrichment exposure. c-Fos mapping revealed that hyperanxiety in high anxiety-like phenotypes was associated with blunted challenge-induced neuronal activation in the cingulate-cortex, which was normalized by environmental enrichment. Relating this finding with epigenetic modifications, we found that high anxiety-like phenotypes (compared with low-innate anxiety phenotypes) showed reduced acetylation in the hypoactivated cingulate-cortex neurons following a mild emotional challenge, which again was normalized by environmental enrichment. Paralleling the findings using environmental enrichment, systemic administration of histone-deacetylase-inhibitor MS-275 elicited an anxiolytic-like effect, which was correlated with increased acetylated-histone-3 levels within cingulate-cortex. Finally, as a proof-of-principle, local MS-275 injection into cingulate-cortex rescued enhanced innate anxiety and increased acetylated-histone-3 within the cingulate-cortex, suggesting this epigenetic mark as a biomarker for treatment success.
   Conclusions Taken together, the present findings provide the first causal evidence that the attenuation of high innate anxiety-like behavior via environmental/pharmacological manipulations is epigenetically mediated via acetylation changes within the cingulate-cortex. Finally, histone-3 specific histone-deacetylase-inhibitor could be of therapeutic importance in anxiety disorders.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) in Wistar rats subjected to maternal deprivation (MD). MD was performed in the first post-natal days (PND) ten for 3 h/day. The groups were: control; deprived without EE; and deprived with EE. The EE was applied for 3 h/day. Forced swimming test (FST) and open field test were performed, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were evaluated on 31, 41, and 61 PND. MD altered spontaneous locomotor activity and immobility time in FST, but the effects were sex- and developmental period dependent. In deprived females at PND 31, 41, and 61, HDAC and DNMT increased in the PFC and hippocampus. In females exposed to EE for 20 days, there was a decrease of HDAC in the hippocampus and DNMT in the PFC and hippocampus. Exposure of females to EE for 40 days can reverse HDAC and DNMT increase in all brain areas. In deprived males at PND 31, 41, and 61, HDAC and DNMT increased in the hippocampus, and in the group exposed to EE for 40 days, there was a decrease in hippocampal activity. In PFC of male deprived rats at PND 61 and EE for 40 days, there was a reduction of HDAC and DNMT. MD induced lifelong persistent behavioral and epigenetic changes, and such effects were more evident in female than male rats. EE can be considered an essential non-pharmacological strategy to treat long-term trauma-induced early life changes.

AB  - ObjectiveEnvironmental exposures impart powerful effects on vulnerability to many brain diseases, including epilepsy. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a common form of epilepsy, and it is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric comorbidities. This study tests the hypothesis that environmental enrichment (EE) confers antiepileptogenic, psychoprotective, and neuroprotective effects in the amygdala kindling model of MTLE, and explores potential neurobiologic mechanisms.
   MethodsAt weaning, male Wistar rats were allocated into either EE (large cages containing running wheels and toys; n = 43) or standard housing (SH; standard laboratory cages; n = 39) conditions. At P56, a bipolar electrode was implanted into the left amygdala, and rats underwent rapid amygdala kindling until experiencing five class V seizures (Racine scale, fully kindled). The elevated plus maze was used to assess anxiety. Postmortem histologic and molecular analyses investigated potential biologic mediators of effects.
   ResultsEE significantly delayed kindling epileptogenesis, with EE rats requiring a significantly greater number of kindling stimulations to reach a fully kindled state compared to SH rats (p < 0.05). EE and kindling both reduced anxiety (p < 0.05). Timm's staining revealed significant reductions in aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in EE rats (p < 0.05), and these effects of EE were accompanied by reduced expression of TrkB and CRH genes.
   SignificanceWe identify beneficial effects of EE on vulnerability to limbic epileptogenesis and anxiety, and identify reduced pathologic neuroplasticity and plasticity-related gene expression as potential underlying mechanisms. Enhanced environmental stimulation represents a potential antiepileptogenic strategy that might also mitigate the common psychiatric comorbidities of MTLE.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is known to have behavioral and physiological anxiolytic effects in several animal models. However, it is as yet unclear how EE modulates behavior of wild animals and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The adult male field mouse Mus booduga (n=42) captured at agricultural field, were housed in non-enriched standard condition (SC) for 7 days and considered as directly from wild (DW). Another two groups of mice were housed in either EE or SC for 30 days. Behavioral testing was carried out to assess their anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM). We found that on EPM, mice housed in EE display less anxiety like behavior when compared to mice housed in SC. Exposure to plus-maze did not increase the levels of corticosterone (CORT) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and circulating CORT, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the mice housed in EE but not in the mice housed in SC. We observed a trend in the EE induced inhibition of expression of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) mRNA levels, which are all known to be involved in the stress response signaling pathway. Our study suggests that EE exerts therapeutic and anxiolytic effects against stressors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rats, Rattus norvegicus, housed with 'environmental enrichment' do better in tests of spatial cognition than rats housed in barren cages. The leading hypothesis is that exposure to `social and inanimate complexity' leads to better cognitive-processing abilities, which directly enhances performance in a spatial task. However, enrichment is associated with reduced stress responses and anxiety in novel or acutely stressful situations (cognitive tasks are typically both). Therefore, a plausible alternative hypothesis is that experience of enrichment indirectly enhances performance by reducing a rat's anxiety levels during cognitive testing. We found that, irrespective of sex, enriched rats outperformed barren-housed rats in the Morris water maze. However, after accounting for the effects of thigmotaxis (a behavioural anxiety measure during testing), there was no significant difference in performance between enriched and barren-housed rats. Enriched rats were simply less thigmotactic and this indirectly improved their performance. This was true for both males and females. We conclude that enrichment reduces anxiety outside the home cage, in a cognitive test situation, and, subsequently, the cognitive benefits of enrichment occur because enriched animals are less anxious during cognitive testing.

AB  - Captive animals suffer from stress and lack of stimulation. Environmental enrichment (EE) provides them with a series of activities that encourages them to present species-specific behaviors. The objective of this work was to analyze the effect of an EE program in the behavior of a 7-spider monkey colony. It was expected that aggression, coprophilia and stereotypes would be less frequent, while exploration and play would increase. The study was divided in two stages: one previous to EE and one while EE was being implemented. A focal sampling per behavior was undertaken in 1-h continuous recordings for a total of 40 hours per stage. We compared the frequency of each behavior with a Wilcoxon's signal test. The results showed that aggression, stereotypes and coprophilia were reduced during EE, while exploration and play increased significantly. No significant differences were found between sexes. EE reduces the problems originated by confinement; therefore, it must be considered a necessary tool to be continuously employed to make an improvement into the life conditions of confined individuals.

AB  - Antagonist and long-lasting environmental manipulations (EM) have successfully induced or reduced the stress responses and quality of life of zebrafish. For instance, environmental enrichment (EE) generally reduces anxietyrelated behaviours and improves immunity, while unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) and aquarium-related stressors generate the opposite effects. However, there is an absence of consistency in outcomes for some EM, such as acute exposure to stressors, social enrichment and some items of structural enrichment. Therefore, considering intraspecies variation (sex, personality, and strain), increasing intervention complexity while improving standardisation of protocols and contemplating the possibility that EE may act as a mild stressor on a spectrum between too much (UCS) and too little (standard conditions) stress intensity or stimulation, would reduce the inconsistencies of these outcomes. It would also help explore the mechanism behind stress resilience and to standardise EM protocols. Thus, this review critically analyses and compares knowledge existing over the last decade concerning environmental manipulations for zebrafish and the influences that sex, strain, and personality may have on behavioural, physiological, and fitness-related responses.

AB  - Mood disorders affect the lives and functioning of millions each year. Epidemiological studies indicate that childhood trauma is predominantly associated with higher rates of both mood and anxiety disorders. Exposure of rats to stress during juvenility (JS) (27-29 days of age) has comparable effects and was suggested as a model of induced predisposition for these disorders. The importance of the environment in the regulation of brain, behavior and physiology has long been recognized in biological, social and medical sciences. Here, we studied the effects of JS on emotional and cognitive aspects of depressive-like behavior in adulthood, on Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity and on the expression of cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1-CAM). Furthermore, we combined it with the examination of potential reversibility by enriched environment (EE) of JS - induced disturbances of emotional and cognitive aspects of behavior in adulthood. Three groups were tested: Juvenile Stress -subjected to Juvenile stress; Enriched Environment -subjected to Juvenile stress and then, from day 30 on to EE; and Naives. In adulthood, coping and stress responses were examined using the elevated plus-maze, open field, novel setting exploration and two way shuttle avoidance learning. We found that, JS rats showed anxiety-and depressive-like behaviors in adulthood, altered HPA axis activity and altered L1-CAM expression. Increased expression of L1-CAM was evident among JS rats in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and Thalamus (TL). Furthermore, we found that EE could reverse most of the effects of Juvenile stress, both at the behavioral, endocrine and at the biochemical levels. The interaction between JS and EE resulted in an increased expression of L1-CAM in dorsal cornu ammonis (CA) area 1 (dCA1).

AB  - Background: Exposure to maternal separation (MS) in rodents may have long-lasting consequences for the structure and function of several brain regions, eventually associated with alterations in cognition and emotion later in life. Post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE) has been reported to ameliorate the detrimental effects of exposure to early life stress mainly in the hippocampus. Method: In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to evaluate possible volumetric changes in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum of 90-day-old male rats after daily MS for 240 min from postnatal days 2-21. Results: No significant volume changes were found in the selected brain regions in MS animals as compared with an age matched control group. However, additional groups of control and MS animals with EE from days 21-60 showed significant volume increases in the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral hippocampus as compared to the groups without EE. In addition, general hemispheric asymmetry was found in the volume of the brain regions measured. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that EE could have differential effects depending on previous exposure to MS and on the development of brain lateralization.

AB  - Exposure to childhood adversity is associated with increased vulnerability to stress-related disorders in adulthood which has been replicated in rodent stress models, whereas environmental enrichment has been suggested to have beneficial effects. However, the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying these environment influences on adult brain and behavior are not well understood. Therefore, we investigated the long-term effects of maternal separation (MS) or environmental enrichment (EE) in male and female CD1 mice. We found clear sex specific effects, but limited influence of environmental manipulations, on adult behavior, fecal corticosterone metabolite (FCM) levels and stress- and plasticity related gene expression in discrete brain regions. In detail, adult females displayed higher locomotor activity and FCM levels compared to males and EE resulted in attenuation in both measures, but only in females. There were no sex- or postnatal manipulation-dependent differences in anxiety-related behaviors in either sex. Gene expression analyses revealed that adult males showed higher Fkbp5 mRNA levels in hippocampus, hypothalamus and raphe nuclei, and higher hippocampal Nos1 levels. Interestingly, MS elevated Nos1 levels in hippocampus but reduced Fkbp5 expression in hypothalamus of males. Finally, we also found higher Maoa expression in the hypothalamus of adult females, however no differences were observed in the expression levels of Bdnf, Crhr1, Nr3c1 and Htr1a. Our findings further contribute to sex-dependent differences in behavior, corticosterone and gene expression and reveal that the effects of postnatal manipulations on these parameters in outbred CD1 mice are limited.

AB  - Recently, several reports on chronic stress have shown that prolonged exposure to stress contributes to psychological and neurological complications. However, the impact of stress-induced alterations in myelination remainsto be unexplored. Therefore,in the current study, the rats were subjected to immobilization stress (IS) followed by enriched environment (EE) and the behavioral, neurochemical changes pertaining to neuronal survival pathway, in addition, to the ultrastructural changes in myelin in forebrain (FB) region of rats were analyzed. Immobilization stress-exposed rats (4h/day IS, for 28days) exhibited increased anhedonia, anxiety, immobility, and reduced social interaction, which could be reflected in increased levels of corticosterone. In contrast, exposure to EE (4h IS+2h EE/day, for 28days) was found to minimize anhedonic state, supress the depressive-like features, enhancesocial interaction and also reduce the levels of corticosterone. The ultrastructural changes in the FB region of the brain revealed that IS group showed enhanced g-ratio indicating decreased myelin thickness, while EE group exhibited reduced g-ratio manifesting increased myelination. Further, the study revealed that IS exposed group showed decreased levels of NGF, TrkA, PI3K, AKT, ERK, CREB, and MBP in FB regions whereas EE group could preserve normal protein and mRNA levels of these neuronal survival molecules. The results from this study suggest that EE exerts a positive impact by improving myelination in rats exposed to chronic immobilization stress.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to exert various behavioral and mood effects in rodents including emotionality, which has a high propensity to be influenced by sex. However, there are only a few comparative studies evaluating the effect of EE and their results are both inconsistent and inconclusive. In the present study, male and female C57BL/6J adolescent mice were housed in either physical enrichment or standard conditions for four weeks with analysis of affective behaviors in the open field, elevated T-maze and forced swim tests. Hippocampal gene expression was characterized in an additional group of mice. In the open field test, exploration was similarly inhibited by EE in male and female mice. Both sex and housing condition influenced the time mice spent in the center of the arena. In the elevated T-maze, anxiety-like behavior was increased in female and decreased in male mice following EE. We observed a trend for EE-induced inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression in male but not in female mice. In contrast, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) expression was unaffected by 10 days of physical enrichment but was lower in female mice compared to male mice. Our data suggest that the balance between hippocampal GR and MR may contribute to the observed sex-specific effect of physical enrichment on emotionality-related behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Can simple enrichments enhance caged mink welfare? Pilot data from 756 sub-adults spanning three colour-types (strains) identified potentially practical enrichments, and suggested beneficial effects on temperament and fur-chewing. Our main experiment started with 2032 Black mink on three farms: from each of 508 families, one juvenile male-female pair was enriched (E) with two balls and a hanging plastic chain or length of hose, while a second pair was left as a non-enriched (NE) control. At 8 months, more than half the subjects were killed for pelts, and 302 new females were recruited (half enriched: 'late E'). Several signs of improved welfare or productivity emerged. Access to enrichment increased play in juveniles. E mink were calmer (less aggressive in temperament tests; quieter when handled; less fearful, if male), and less likely to fur-chew, although other stereotypic behaviours were not reduced. On one farm, E females had lower cortisol (inferred from faecal metabolites). E males tended to copulate for longer. E females also weaned more offspring: about 10% more juveniles per E female, primarily caused by reduced rates of barrenness ('late E' females also giving birth to bigger litters on one farm), effects that our data cautiously suggest were partly mediated by reduced inactivity and changes in temperament. Pelt quality seemed unaffected, but E animals had cleaner cages. In a subsidiary side-study using 368 mink of a second colour-type ('Demis'), similar temperament effects emerged, and while E did not reduce fur-chewing or improve reproductive success in this colour-type, E animals were judged to have better pelts. Overall, simple enrichments were thus beneficial. These findings should encourage welfare improvements on fur farms (which house 60-70 million mink p.a.) and in breeding centres where endangered mustelids (e.g. black-footed ferrets) often reproduce poorly. They should also stimulate future research into more effective practical enrichments.

AB  - Exposure to early stressful events increases susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood, in which the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a crucial role. Studies have found that environmental enrichment (EE) mitigates the detrimental outcomes of early adversity. How -ever, the HPA-related mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used the single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm to explore the long-term effects of early adolescent stress on behavior, HPA axis activ-ity, as well as expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRF1R) and CRF2R in the hypothalamus and hippocam-pus. Meanwhile, the protective effects of EE intervention were examined. We found that adult male rats exposed to adolescent stress showed reduced locomotor activity, increased anxiety-like behaviors, enhanced contextual fear memory, elevated basal plasma ACTH levels, and enhanced HPA negative feed-back inhibition, as indicated by decreased plasma ACTH levels in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Furthermore, EE normalized the behavioral abnormalities and enhanced HPA negative feedback in stressed rats, possibly through down-regulating GR expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These findings suggested that EE could ameliorate adolescent stress-induced PTSD-like behaviors and aberrant reprogramming of the HPA axis, reducing the risk of developing PTSD in adulthood.

TI  - Environmental enrichment strategies for nursery piglets and efficacy for maintaining interest (vol 60, pg 1995, 2020)
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Context Animals in situations of stress and constant fear exhibit unwanted behaviours for production. Pigs that are afraid of humans tend to associate any management as stressful. The use of environment enrichment for pigs may help to alleviate anxiety and fear, and hence reduce unwanted behaviours during handling. However, provision of appropriate enrichment presents challenges such as the rapid loss of interest in objects by animals.
   Aims The present study evaluated the effects of different environmental enrichment strategies on the behaviour of pigs at the nursery stage, maintenance of animal interest in the enrichment objects, and their reflexes when faced with emotionally negative situations.
   Methods Piglets (n = 425) were assigned in a completely randomised design with five treatments and five replicates per treatment (17 animal per replicate). The treatments employed were: control, no enriching objects in the environment; WB, wooden box with popcorn and wood shavings; PT, objects made of plastic tubing; WB and PT concurrently; and WB or PT on alternate days. Behavioural observations were made over 10 days for 8 h each day, divided into four periods of 2 h. Piglets from enriched (n = 10) and non-enriched (n = 10) environments were subjected to three fear tests (human approach, novel object and novel arena).
   Key results No significant (P > 0.05) effect was found for the type of enrichment provided or strategy adopted (concurrent vs alternating) on the time piglets interacted with the enrichment objects. Animals kept in an environment with no stimulus had higher frequency (P 0.05) of undesirable behaviours than those with enrichment, regardless of enrichment type or strategy adopted. Piglets reared without enrichment, when isolated in a new environment, had higher frequency of behaviours such as defecating, urinating and attempting escape, as well as more and longer vocalisation events (P 0.05). Piglets reared in an enriched environment had higher frequency and duration of interaction with a new object, as well as shorter latency time for the first contact with the object (P 0.05).
   Conclusions The use of enrichment objects in the rearing environment of piglets at the nursery stage reduced undesirable behaviours, suggesting reduced fear and anxiety, and may therefore improve their psychological wellbeing.
   Implications Use of enrichment objects during rearing may have implications for alleviation of chronic stress, which leads to constant release of cortisol, an immune suppressor hormone that reduces the health status of the batch and hence production indices.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has beneficial neurobiological, physiological and behavioral effects. The purpose of the present paper is to review the animal research literature pertaining to the impact of EE on altering physiological and behavioral anxiety outcomes. Evidence supports the view that EE attenuates responses to certain anxiety provoking situations, and that these effects persist over time. Specifically, EE attenuates behavioral anxiety-type responses and endocrine responses mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis evoked by psychogenic and/or neurogenic stressors. EE is not only able to protect:from excessive anxiety in response to a present stressor, but also attenuates the enduring or persistent effects engendered by past psychogenic stressor(s) such as prenatal stress or neonatal maternal separation. It is noteworthy that the protective effects of EE are particularly apparent in animals that are highly anxious or when the task is highly challenging for the subject. Various mechanisms of action of EE have been proposed, ranging from behavioral/cognitive to cellular/molecular processes. A pronounced variability in the enrichment protocols used by different investigators may account for some of the inconsistencies noted in the effect of EE on behavioral (e.g. anxiety) and endocrine (e.g. plasma corticosterone) responses. Although the occasional inconsistencies highlight the need for further research, a preponderance of the animal research data indicates that EE exerts therapeutic and protective (anxiolytic) effects against (a) impending threat, (b) enduring effects of past stressor(s) and (c) subsequent stressors.

AB  - Exposure to an enriched environment (EE) or the intake of a highly palatable diet may reduce the response to chronic stress in rodents. To further explore the relationships between EE, dietary intake and stress, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of two diets for 5 weeks: high carbohydrate (HC) or "cafeteria" (CAF) (Standard HC plus a choice of highly palatable cafeteria foods: chocolate, biscuits, and peanut butter). In addition, they were either housed in empty cages or cages with EE. After the first two weeks, half of the animals from each group were stressed daily using a chronic variable stress (CVS) paradigm, while the other half were kept undisturbed. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the 5-week period. The effects of stress, enrichment and dietary intake on animal adiposity, serum lipids, and stress hormones were analyzed. Results showed an increase in intra-abdominal fat associated with the CAF diet and an increase in body weight gain associated with both the CAF diet and EE. Furthermore, the increase in ACTH associated with CVS was attenuated in the presence of EE and the CAF diet independently while the stress-induced increase in corticosterone was reduced by the combination of EE and CAF feeding. The present study provides evidence that the availability of a positive environment combined to a highly palatable diet increases resilience to the effects of CVS in rats. These results highlight the important place of palatable food and supportive environments in reducing central stress responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forced Swimming Test (FST) models behavioural despair in animals by loss of motivation to respond or the refusal to escape. The present study was aimed at characterizing genetic (genotype and gender) and environmental factors (age/stage of disease and rearing conditions: C, standard; H, early postnatal handling; EE, environmental enrichment consisting in physical exercise as well as social and object enrichment) that may modulate the poor behavioural and cognitive flexibility response we have recently described in 12-month-old male 3xTg-AD mice in the FST. The comprehensive analysis of the ethogram shown in the FST considered the intervals of the test (0-2 and 2-6 min), all the elicited behavioural responses (immobility, swimming and climbing) and their features (total duration and frequency of episodes). The long persistence of behaviours found in 17-month-old (late-stages of disease) 3xTg-AD mice was comparable to that recently described in males at 12 months of age (beginning of advanced stages) but also suggested increased age-dependent frailty in both genotypes. The poor behavioral flexibility of 3xTg-AD mice to elicit the behavioural despair shown by the NTg mice, was also found in the female gender. Finally, the present work demonstrates that early-life interventions were able to improve the time and frequency of episodes of immobility, being more evident in the female gender of both old NTg and 3xTg-AD mice. Ontogenic modulation by early-postnatal handling resulted in a more effective long-term improvement of the elicited behaviours in the FST than that achieved by environmental enrichment. The results talk in favor of the beneficence of early-life interventions on ageing in both healthy and disease conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - When given the opportunity, many captive animal species make use of a running wheel. Wheel running is often used as an environmental enrichment to increase general locomotor activities. Yet, it is still debated whether wheel running is an enrichment or a stereotypic behaviour. Here, we investigated the motivation to use a running wheel in African striped mice. Individual striped mice showing locomotory stereotypy or were nonstereotypic were exposed randomly to three different treatments in which we restricted space for displaying stereotypy in a 1) home cage, 2) an attached experimental cage, or 3) space was unrestricted in both cages. Individuals spent 15 days in each treatment, during which we recorded their behaviour every second day. We also accounted for personality in the use of running wheels. Stereotypic striped mice were more active (i.e. nonstereotypic activity) and used the running wheel more than non-stereotypic individuals, which were less active. Half (52%) of the stereotypic mice incorporated the running wheel in their stereotypic routine, and the remaining 48% used the running wheel as part of their general activity. Furthermore, while wheel running may have reduced stereotypic behaviours in the striped mice that used it as enrichment, it was not solely responsible for the reduction. The combined effect of cage complexity and the running wheel acted in synergy in reducing stereotypic behaviours, as shown by an increase in general activity. Personality considers intra-individual consistency and inter-individual variation, yet individual stereotypic striped mice showed varied behavioural responses to the running wheel, contrary to the personality theory. Thus, implementing a running wheel should be tailored for identified individuals rather than a species-wide implementation.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) involves the presentation of various sensory, physical, social, and cognitive stimuli in order to alter neural activity in specific brain areas, which can ameliorate methamphetamine (MAMPH)-induced behavioral sensitization and comorbid anxiety symptoms. No previous studies have comprehensively examined which EE components are critical for effectively reducing MAMPH-induced behavioral sensitization and anxiety. This study examined different housing conditions, including standard housing (SH, No EE), standard EE (STEE), physical EE (PEE), cognitive EE (CEE), and social EE (SEE). In the beginning, mice were randomly assigned to the different combinations of housing conditions and injections, consisting of No EE/Saline, No EE/MAMPH, STEE/MAMPH, PEE/MAMPH, CEE/MAMPH, and SEE/MAMPH groups. Then, the mice received intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg/kg MAMPH or normal saline daily for 7 days, followed by a final injection of 0.5 mg/kg MAMPH or normal saline. After behavioral tests, all mice were examined for c-Fos immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that MAMPH induced behavioral sensitization as measured by distance traveled. MAMPH appeared to induce lowered anxiety responses and severe hyperactivity. All EE conditions did not affect MAMPH-induced lowered anxiety behaviors. STEE was likely more effective for reducing MAMPH-induced behavioral sensitization than PEE, CEE, and SEE. The c-Fos expression analysis showed that the medial prefrontal cortex (i.e., cingulate cortex 1 (Cg1), prelimbic cortex (PrL), and infralimbic cortex (IL)), nucleus accumbens (NAc), basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral tegmental area (VTA), caudate-putamen (CPu), and hippocampus (i.e., CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG)) contributed to MAMPH-induced behavioral sensitization. The Cg1, IL, NAc, BLA, VTA, CPu, CA3, and DG also mediated STEE reductions in MAMPH-induced behavioral sensitization. This study indicates that all components of EE are crucial for ameliorating MAMPH-induced behavioral sensitization, as no individual EE component was able to effectively reduce MAMPH-induced behavioral sensitization. The present findings provide insight into the development of non-pharmacological interventions for reducing MAMPH-induced behavioral sensitization.

AB  - Background: Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to modulate behavior and hippocampal gene expression; however, the currently available literature does not explain the differential effects that may relate to the duration of EE.
   Aim To investigate the differential effects of short- and long-term EE on locomotion, anxiety-, depressive- and cognition-like behaviors, and hippocampal gene expression under physiological conditions.
   Methods: We assigned either short-term or long-term intervention with respective controls to healthy C57BL/6 mice (n = 12-16/group). The short-term EE group received EE for four weeks starting at eight months of age, while the long-term EE group received EE for six months starting at three months of age. Differential effects of the duration of EE on various behaviors and hippocampal gene expression at nine months of age were measured using an established behavioral battery and high-throughput RT-qPCR, respectively.
   Results: Both short-term and long-term EE significantly enhanced locomotion in the home cage and reduced depressive-like behavior in the forced-swim test. Long-term EE, however, reduced locomotion in the open-field test. Additionally, short-term EE reduced the mean body weight and showed anxiolytic effects in the elevated-zero maze (EZM), while these effects were lost after long-term EE. There were no effects of either short-term or long-term EE on the expression of 43 hippocampal genes of interest tested at adjusted p < 0.05.
   Conclusion: Both short and long-term EE are equally beneficial for baseline locomotor activity and depressive-like behavior. However, long-term EE affects locomotion adversely in a threatening environment and is anxiogenic.

AB  - According to the "neurotrophin hypothesis", brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important candidate gene in depression. Moreover, environmental stress is known to represent a risk factor in the pathophysiology and treatment of this disease.
   To elucidate, whether changes of BDNF availability signify cause or consequence of depressive-like alterations, it is essential to look for endophenotypes under distinct genetic conditions (e.g. altered BDNF expression). Furthermore it is crucial to examine environment-driven BDNF regulation and its effect on depressive-linked features. Consequently, gene x environment studies investigating prospective genetic mouse models of depression in different environmental contexts become increasingly important.
   The present review summarizes recent findings in BDNF-mutant mice, which have been controversially discussed as models of depression and anxiety. It furthermore illustrates the potential of environment to serve as naturalistic stressor with the potential to modulate the phenotype in wildtype and mutant mice. Moreover, environment may exert protective effects by regulating BDNF levels as attributed to "environmental enrichment". The effect of this beneficial condition will also be discussed with regard to probable "curative/therapeutic" approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Early life stress is associated with long-term and pervasive adverse effects on neuroendocrine development, affecting normal cognitive and emotional development. Experimental manipulations like environmental enrichment (EE) may potentially reverse the effects of early life stress induced by maternal separation (MS) paradigm in rodents. However, the functional brain networks involved in the effects of EE after prolonged exposure to MS have not yet been investigated. In order to evaluate possible changes in brain functional connectivity induced by EE after MS, quantitative cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) histochemistry was applied to determine regional brain oxidative metabolism in adult male rats. Unexpectedly, results show that prolonged MS during the entire weaning period did not cause any detrimental effects on spatial learning and memory, including depressive-like behavior evaluated in the forced-swim test, and decreased anxiety-like behavior. However, EE seemed to alter anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in both control and MS groups, but improved spatial memory in the latter groups. Analysis of brain CCO activity showed significantly lower metabolic capacity in most brain regions selected in EE groups probably associated with chronic stress, but no effects of MS on brain metabolic capacity. In addition, principal component analysis of CCO activity revealed increased large-scale functional brain connectivity comprising at least three main networks affected by EE in both MS and control groups. Moreover, EE induced a pattern of functional brain connectivity associated with stress and anxiety-like behavior as compared with non-enriched groups. In conclusion, EE had differential effects on cognition and emotional behavior irrespective of exposure to MS. In view of the remarkable effects of EE on brain function and behavior, implementation of rodent housing conditions should be optimized by evaluating the balance between scientific validity and animal welfare.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) has long been regarded as a disease of the central nervous system, partly due to typical disease symptoms that include loss of motor control, cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric disturbances. However, the huntingtin gene is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. We had previously reported a female-specific depression-related behavioural phenotype in the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD. One hypothesis suggests that pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the key physiological stress-response system that links central and peripheral organs, is a cause of depression. There is evidence of HPA axis pathology in HD, but whether it contributes to the female R6/1 behavioural phenotype is unclear. We have examined HPA axis response of R6/1 mice following acute stress and found evidence of a female-specific dysregulation of the HPA axis in R6/1 mice, which we further isolated to a hyper-response of adrenal cortical cells to stimulation by adrenocorticotrophin hormone. Interestingly, the adrenal pathophysiology was not detected in mice that had been housed in environmentally enriching conditions, an effect of enrichment that was also reproduced in vitro. This constitutes the first evidence that environmental enrichment can in fact exert a lasting influence on peripheral organ function. Cognitive stimulation may therefore not only have benefits for mental function, but also for overall physiological wellbeing.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been studied as a protocol that can improve brain plasticity and may protect against negative insults such as chronic stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of EE on the hormonal and behavioral responses induced by chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMS) in rats, considering the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system. Male adult rats were divided into 4 groups: control, CMS, EE, and CMS + EE, and the experimental protocol lasted for 7 weeks. EE was performed during 7 weeks, 5 days per week, 2 h per day. CMS was applied during weeks 3, 4, and 5. After the CMS (week 6), depression-like behavior was evaluated by forced swimming and sucrose consumption tests, anxiety level was evaluated using the elevated plus-maze test, and memory was evaluated using the Y-maze test. On week 7, the animals were euthanized and basal plasma levels of corticosterone and catecholamines were determined. The hypothalamus was isolated and tissue levels of angiotensin peptides were evaluated. CMS increased plasma corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine basal concentrations, induced depression-like behaviors, impaired memory, and increased hypothalamic angiotensin I, II, and IV concentrations. EE decreased stress hormones secretion, depression-like behaviors, memory impairment, and hypothalamic angiotensin II induced by stress. Reductions of anxiety-like behavior and norepinephrine secretion were observed in both stressed and unstressed groups. The results indicated that EE seemed to protect adult rats against hormonal and behavioral CMS effects, and that the reduction of angiotensin II could contribute to these effects.

AB  - Background: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be considered the result of a failure to recover after a traumatic experience. Here we studied possible protective and therapeutic aspects of environmental enrichment (with and without a running wheel) in Sprague Dawley rats exposed to an inescapable foot shock procedure (IFS).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: IFS induced long-lasting contextual and non-contextual anxiety, modeling some aspects of PTSD. Even 10 weeks after IFS the rats showed reduced locomotion in an open field. The antidepressants imipramine and escitalopram did not improve anxiogenic behavior following IFS. Also the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sodium butyrate did not alleviate the IFS induced immobility. While environmental enrichment (EE) starting two weeks before IFS did not protect the animals from the behavioral effects of the shocks, exposure to EE either immediately after the shock or one week later induced complete recovery three weeks after IFS. In the next set of experiments a running wheel was added to the EE to enable voluntary exercise (EE/VE). This also led to reduced anxiety. Importantly, this behavioral recovery was not due to a loss of memory for the traumatic experience. The behavioral recovery correlated with an increase in cell proliferation in hippocampus, a decrease in the tissue levels of noradrenalin and increased turnover of 5-HT in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.
   Conclusions/Significance: This animal study shows the importance of (physical) exercise in the treatment of psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder and points out the possible role of EE in studying the mechanism of recovery from anxiety disorders.

AB  - Research has shown that the domestic pig is highly playful throughout its development and that play is an important aspect of social and cognitive development. Therefore, the neonatal environment is fundamental to successful stimulation of play in neonatal pigs, which could have indirect and direct socio-cognitive effects on pigs post-weaning and therefore influence social interactions known to cause welfare concerns (e.g. aggression during mixing). This study investigated how play pre- and post-weaning developed in two neonatal environments (NE); the conventional farrowing crate (NEC) and a more environmentally complex alternative PigSAFE pen (NEP) and to discover whether this had an effect on piglet' cognitive abilities in spontaneous object recognition tests for two retention times (15 and 60 min) post-weaning. Hourly focal sampling was used to record play behaviours pre- and post-weaning in 72 piglets of mixed sex (36 per NE) from a total population of 117 piglets from 12 litters. Out of the 72 piglets, 24 were used in the cognitive spontaneous object recognition tests five weeks post-weaning. Linear mixed models showed that NEP piglets displayed play behaviours quicker after birth than NEC piglets: locomotor (F=7.62((1, 11)), P=0.020); sow interaction (F=5.27((1,11)), P=0.045); and social interaction (F=23.61((1, 11)), P<0.001). NEP piglets played more pre-weaning than NEC piglets (F=5.06((1,71)), P=0.051) and despite initial higher levels of aggression at weaning, displayed less chronic aggression post-weaning as indicated by lesion scores of all piglets (F=27.05((1,116)), P<0.001). NE was shown to have a significant effect on the 15 min cognitive retention test; with NEP piglets spending more time interacting with the novel object than the familiar, compared to NEC piglets (F=5.39((1,23)), P=0.045). There was no NE effect for the 60 min retention test. It was concluded that play is fundamental to successful socio-cognitive development (e.g. aggressive conflicts) and relates to play function theories of training for the unexpected. Its effect on play behaviours are short-term and highly dependent on present environmental stimulus, suggesting that any long-term benefits play may have on an animal's welfare can only be achieved by regular stimulation throughout its life (e.g. constant enrichment).

AB  - Simple Summary Two important questions about the intensive housing of pigs concern whether young pigs require environmental enrichment to enhance their welfare, and from what age should enrichment be provided to pigs to achieve the benefit? We provided sucker and weaner pigs with enrichment in the form of blocks, which they could push around the floor of the pen, compared to no blocks (barren' control). Behavioural and physiological responses of the pigs were then measured in a series of standard tests used to assess fear response, learning, and cognitive ability. Enrichment blocks modified the behavioural responses of pigs in the different tests, suggesting enriched pigs were more willing to explore novel environments and they had increased ability to learn. However, our enrichment treatment did not alter the pigs' cortisol response, suggesting any differences due to enrichment were subtle. In contrast, the altered behavioural responses probably indicate that although pigs readily learned complex tasks and modify their behaviour to suit the current situation, there may be some potential benefits from enrichment when applied during the early weeks of a pig's life that might have life-long benefits for the animal and its welfare.
   Abstract We tested the hypothesis that provision of enrichment in the form of enrichment blocks during the sucker and weaner phases would affect the behaviour of pigs. We measured the performance of pigs in an open field/novel object test, a maze test, an executive function test and the cortisol response of the pigs after exposure to an open field test. The provision of enrichment blocks altered the behaviour of the pigs in all three tests and these changes suggest an increased willingness to explore and possibly an increased ability to learn. The behavioural tests highlighted that young pigs have the capacity to learn complex tasks. Our findings support the notion that the benefits of enrichment cannot be evaluated by measuring the interactions the animal has with the enrichments in the home pen and it may simply be beneficial to live in a more complex environment. We have highlighted that the early rearing environment is important and that the management and husbandry at an early age can have long-term implications for pigs. The enrichment we used in this study was very simple, an enrichment block, and we provide evidence suggesting the provision of enrichment effected pig behavioural responses. Even the simplest of enrichments may have benefits for the welfare and development of young pigs and there is merit in developing enrichment devices that are suitable for use in pig production.

   Methods: On postnatal day 11, the animals received either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or Streptococcus pneumoniae suspension intracisternally at 1 x 10(6) CFU/mL and remained with their mothers until age 21 days. Animals were divided into the following groups: control, control + EE, meningitis, and meningitis + EE. EE began at 21 days and continued until 60 days of age (adulthood). EE consisted of a large cage with three floors, ramps, running wheels, and objects of different shapes and textures. At 60 days, animals were randomized and subjected to habituation to the open-field task and the step-down inhibitory avoidance task. After the tasks, the hippocampus and CSF were isolated for analysis.
   Results: The meningitis group showed no difference in performance between training and test sessions of the open-field task, suggesting habituation memory impairment; in the meningitis + EE group, performance was significantly different, showing preservation of habituation memory. In the step-down inhibitory avoidance task, there were no differences in behavior between training and test sessions in the meningitis group, showing aversive memory impairment; conversely, differences were observed in the meningitis + EE group, demonstrating aversive memory preservation. In the two meningitis groups, IL-4, IL-10, and BDNF levels were increased in the hippocampus, and BDNF levels in the CSF.
   Conclusions: The data presented suggest that EE, a non-invasive therapy, enables recovery from memory deficits caused by neonatal meningitis.

AB  - Because stress may underlie the presence of depressive episodes, strategies to produce protection against or to reverse the effects of stress on neuroplasticity and behavior are relevant. Preclinical studies showed that exposure to stimuli, such as physical activity and environmental enrichment (ENR), produce beneficial effects against stress causing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Additionally, ENR induces positive effects on neuroplasticity, neurochemistry and behavior at any age of rodents tested. Here, we analyzed whether ENR exposure prevents the development of depressive-like behavior produced by unpredictable, chronic mild stress (CMS) exposure as well as changes in hippocampal neurogenesis in a six-month-old female Balb/C mice, strain that shows low baseline levels of hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice were assigned to one of four groups: (1) normal housing-normal housing (NH-NH), (2) NH-CMS, (3) ENR-NH, or (4) ENR-CMS. The animals were exposed over 46 days to ENR or NH and subsequently to NH or CMS for 4 weeks. ENR induces long-term effects protecting against CMS induction of anhedonia and hopelessness behaviors. Independent of housing conditions, ENR increased the number of proliferative cells (Ki67), and CMS decreased the number of proliferative cells. ENR increased the newborn cells (BrdU) and mature phenotypes of neurons; these effects were not changed by CMS exposure. Similarly, the number of doublecortin-positive cells was not affected by CMS in ENR mice, which showed more cells with complex dendrite arborizations. Our study suggests that ENR induces protection against the effects of CMS on behavior and neuroplasticity in six-month-old Balb/C mice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental enrichment for mice lags behind the standard enrichment offered to other laboratory rodents due to concerns about environmental variability and, in specific contexts, aggression. Our objective in this study was to evaluate concerns that the introduction of structural enrichment in the form of a single red acrylic mouse tunnel into murine housing may confound study findings. We measured effects on anxiety-like behaviors (elevated zero maze and open field activity), hippocampal neurogenesis, body weight gain, and physiologic markers of stress (adrenal gland weight, plasma corticosterone concentration, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Male and female C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: a standard-housed control group with enrichment consisting of paper nesting material, or an enriched group that received a single acrylic tunnel in addition to nesting material. All results fell within biologically normal ranges regardless of treatment, and variability (standard deviation) was not significantly different between groups for any measure. Mice in the enriched group showed modest differences during open field testing suggestive of decreased anxiety, traveling farther and depositing fewer fecal boli than standard-housed mice. Male mice in the tunnel-enriched group gained more body weight than standard-housed male mice. No significant effects by treatment were found in neurogenic or physiologic parameters. These results indicate that provision of simple structural enrichment is unlikely to have confounding effects on murine anxiety-like behaviors, neurogenesis, body weight gain, or physiologic parameters. We therefore recommend the inclusion of simple structural enrichment, such as an acrylic tunnel, to the standard environmental enrichment of social housing and nesting material for mice.

AB  - Ischemia is known to increase the deleterious effect of beta-amyloid (A beta), contributing to early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigated whether transient ischemia may function as a trigger for A beta-dependent synaptic impairment in the entorhinal cortex (EC), acting through specific cellular signaling. We found that synaptic depression induced by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) was enhanced in EC slices either in presence of synthetic oligomeric A beta or in slices from mutant human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (mhAPP J20). OGD-induced synaptic depression was ameliorated by functional suppression of RAGE. In particular, overexpression of the dominant-negative form of RAGE targeted to microglia (DNMSR) protects against OGD-induced synaptic impairment in an amyloid-enriched environment, reducing the activation of stress-related kinases (p38MAPK and JNK) and the release of IL-1 beta. Our results demonstrate a prominent role for the RAGE-dependent neuroinflammatory pathway in the synaptic failure induced by A beta and triggered by transient ischemia.

AB  - While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after exposure to severe traumatic events, data have shown that individuals with high sensation-seeking personality traits are less prone to developing PTSD. The current study used the rodent environmental enrichment preclinical model of sensation-seeking to determine if similar sensation seeking effects in animal models of PTSD-like behaviors were found. The study also attempted to determine whether environmental enrichment altered the effects of midazolam on these PTSD-like behaviors. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were received at postnatal day (PND) 21 and placed into either an enriched (EC), isolated (IC), or social (SC) condition. Beginning on PND 51, the animals underwent 3 fear conditioning trials where a tone was paired with a 2 s 0.7 mA footshock. Twenty-four hours later, rats were given 15-min i.p. pretreatments of 0, 0.5, or 1.5 mg/kg midazolam, before being placed into fear conditioning chambers for a test of expression of conditioned fear response in a novel context. Following fear conditioning, rodents were also tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the forced swim task (FST) following pretreatments of midazolam. Results from fear conditioning indicated IC rats showed a significant decrease in freezing during acquisition compared to EC and SC rats. Also, during expression, IC rats had lower freezing following saline injections and 0.5 mg/kg midazolam but were equal in time freezing to EC and SC rats following 1.5 mg/kg midazolam. In the EPM there were no effects of midazolam and IC rats showed decreased time spent in the open arms compared to EC and SC rats. In FST, IC rats spent less time immobile and more time swimming compared to EC and SC rats. Overall, results suggest that the rodent environmental enrichment model of sensation-seeking seems to parallel the effects of sensation-seeking on likelihood of PTSD symptoms seen in humans.

AB  - Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized, in part, by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food in a short period of time. Repetitive binge episodes are a common pattern of consumption during the early stages of substance abuse, and it has been proposed that binge patterns of consumption might favor the transition to BED and "food addiction". Therefore, it is of paramount importance to provide new behavioral strategies that protect vulnerable binge-prone individuals from transitioning to BED and food addiction. Recently, we showed protective and therapeutic benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) on binge-like intake of ethanol in C57BL/6J mice, in agreement with previous evidence showing EE modulation of drug intake, drug relapse and drug reward. In the present study, adolescent mice reared under EE conditions were evaluated for binge-like consumption of sucrose during adulthood in a long-term drinking in the dark (DID) procedure that effectively models binge consumption in humans. Additionally, we tested binge-like intake in adults reared under standard conditions (SE) with long-term exposure to sucrose DID and the effects on sucrose DID of switching from SE to EE conditions. We report here, for the first time, that early EE exposure protects mice from binge-like excessive sucrose intake during adulthood. Ongoing binge-like high sucrose intake in SE-reared mice was also significantly reduced when switched to EE conditions. The present observations suggest that EE exposure might be a promising tool for preventing repetitive binge-like sucrose consumption from transitioning to BED and food addiction.

AB  - Positive experiences in early life may improve the capacity to cope with adulthood stress through epigenetic modification. We investigated whether an enriched environment (EE) in the postnatal period affected epigenetic changes in the p11 gene induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in adult C57BL/6J mice. EE was introduced for 5 weeks during postnatal days 21-55. After EE, the mice were subjected to CUS for 4 weeks. EE prevented depression-like behavior induced by adult CUS. EE prevented a decrease in p11 mRNA and histone H3 acetylation induced by CUS, with changes in the expression of histone deacetylase 5. Moreover, EE prevented changes in trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3K27 induced by CUS. Furthermore, EE had positive effects on behavior and epigenetic alterations in adult mice without CUS. These results suggest that one of the underlying mechanisms of early-life EE may involve epigenetic modification of the hippocampal p11 gene promoter.

AB  - For captive animals, living in barren conditions leads to stereotypic behaviour that is hard to alleviate using environmental enrichment. This resistance to enrichment is often explained via mechanisms that decouple abnormal behaviour from current welfare, such as 'establishment': a hypothetical process whereby repetition increases behaviour's predictability and resistance to change. If such hypotheses are correct, then animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should still find enrichments rewarding. Alternatively, this behaviour could reflect a failure to improve welfare: plausible because age and chronic stress increase neophobia and anhedonia. If this hypothesis is correct, animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should value enrichments less than conspecifics. We tested these hypotheses using C57BL/6 mice, Mus musculus, aged 10-11 and 6-7 months, raised in barren laboratory cages. We observed their behaviour in both these and large enriched cages. Enrichment was more effective on the younger animals. However, contrary to ideas about establishment, the spontaneous predictability of stereotypic behaviour did not increase with age; nor was enrichment less effective on more predictable or time-consuming forms. We assessed the reward value of enriched cages by allowing access via progressively weighted doors ( maximum weight pushed corresponding to peak motivation). In older mice, those individuals whose stereotypic behaviour was least reduced by enrichment were also the least motivated to gain access to enrichment. This suggests that the welfare of middle-aged-animals, as well as their stereotypic behaviour, is harder to improve using environmental enrichment.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the dentate gyrus is known to respond to environmental enrichment, chronic stress, and many other factors. The function of AHN may vary across the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, as different subdivisions are responsible for different functions. The dorsal pole regulates cognitive-related behaviors, while the ventral pole mediates mood-related responses through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In this study, we investigate different methods of quantifying the effect of environmental enrichment on AHN in the dorsal and ventral parts of the dentate gyrus (dDG and vDG). To this purpose, 11-week-old female CD-1 mice were assigned for 8 days to one of two conditions: the Environmental Enrichment (E) group received (i) running wheels, (ii) larger cages, (iii) plastic tunnels, and (iv) bedding with male urine, while the Control (C) group received standard housing. Dorsal CA (Cornu Ammonis) and DG regions were larger in the E than the C animals. Distance run linearly predicted the volume of the dorsal hippocampus, as well as of the intermediate and ventral CA regions. In the dDG, the amount of Doublecortin (DCX) immunoreactivity was significantly higher in E than in C mice. Surprisingly, this pattern was the opposite in the vDG (C > E). Real-time PCR measurement of Dcx mRNA and DCX protein analysis using ELISA showed the same pattern. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) immunoreactivity and mRNA displayed no difference between E and C, suggesting that upregulation of DCX was not caused by changes in BDNF levels. BDNF levels were higher in vDG than in dDG, as measured by both methods. Bdnf expression in vDG correlated positively with the distance run by individual E mice. The similarity in the patterns of immunoreactivity, mRNA and protein for differential DCX expression and for BDNF distribution suggests that the latter two methods might be effective tools for more rapid quantification of AHN.

AB  - Opioid addiction is a major social, economic, and medical problem worldwide. Long-term adverse consequences of chronic opiate exposure not only involve the individuals themselves but also their offspring. Adolescent maternal morphine exposure results in behavior and morphologic changes in the brain of their adult offspring. However, few studies investigate the effect of adult opiate exposure on their offspring. Furthermore, the underlying molecular signals regulating the intergenerational effects of morphine exposure are still elusive. We report here that morphine exposure of adult male and female rats resulted in anxiety-like behavior and dendritic retraction in the dentate gyms (DG) region of the hippocampus in their adult offspring. The behavior and morphologic changes were concomitant with the downregulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2 signaling in the granular zone of DG. Overexpression of hippocampal IGF-2 by bilateral intra-DG injection of lentivirus encoding the IGF-2 gene prevented anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring. Furthermore, exposure to an enriched environment during adolescence corrected the reduction of hippocampal IGF-2 expression, normalized anxiety-like behavior and reversed dendritic retraction in the adult offspring. Thus, parental morphine exposure can lead to the downregulation of hippocampal IGF-2, which contributed to the anxiety and hippocampal dendritic retraction in their offspring. An adolescent-enriched environment experience prevented the behavior and morphologic changes in their offspring through hippocampal IGF-2 signaling. IGF-2 and an enriched environment may be a potential intervention to prevention of anxiety and brain atrophy in the offspring of parental opioid exposure.

AB  - The postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 is a major element of synapses. PSD-95 is involved in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and numerous psychiatric disorders. However, contradictory data about PSD-95 expression in aging and AD have been reported. Indeed in AD versus control brains PSD-95 varies according to regions, increasing in the frontal cortex, at least in a primary stage, and decreasing in the temporal cortex. In contrast, in transgenic mouse models of aging and AD PSD-95 expression is decreased, in behaviorally aged impaired versus unimpaired rodents it can decrease or increase and finally, it is increased in rodents grown in enriched environments. Different factors explain these contradictory results in both animals and humans, among others concomitant psychiatric endophenotypes, such as depression. The possible involvement of PSD-95 in reactive and/or compensatory mechanisms during AD progression is underscored, at least before the occurrence of important synaptic elimination. Thus, in AD but not in AD transgenic mice, enhanced expression might precede the diminution commonly observed in advanced aging. A two-compartments cell model, separating events taking place in cell bodies and synapses, is presented. Overall these data suggest that AD research will progress by untangling pathological from protective events, a prerequisite for effective therapeutic strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We compared glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression in the hippocampus of rats subjected to a low protein, "malnourished" diet (M; 6% protein) or a control, "wellnourished" diet (W; 16% protein), exposed to different environmental stimulation (environmental enrichment, E; no enrichment, N) between postnatal day 8 (P8) and P35. Rats were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM) on P36. Male Wistar rats were split into two groups at birth according to diet (M or W) and subdivided according to environmental stimulation (E or N). GR expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and GR immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus. Our results showed that MN rats spent more time and made more entries into the open arms of the EPM compared to W rats. On the other hand, ME rats spent a similar percentage of time, and made a similar number of entries, in the open arms as WN rats. Following the EPM test, GR mRNA expression in the hippocampus was different in MN rats compared to W rats; expression was also different between M and ME rats; mRNA and expression of GR receptors in WN rats was similar to that observed in WE rats. These data also show that the effects of malnutrition on risk assessment in the EPM were reversed by E. Early malnutrition may alter GR expression in the hippocampus and environmental enrichment may exert a neuroprotective effect on malnutrition-induced brain injury. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Individuals differ in the way they judge ambiguous information: some individuals interpret ambiguous information in a more optimistic, and others in a more pessimistic way. Over the past two decades, such "optimistic" and "pessimistic" cognitive judgment biases (CJBs) have been utilized in animal welfare science as indicators of animals' emotional states. However, empirical studies on their ecological and evolutionary relevance are still lacking. We, therefore, aimed at transferring the concept of "optimism" and "pessimism" to behavioral ecology and investigated the role of genetic and environmental factors in modulating CJB in mice. In addition, we assessed the temporal stability of individual differences in CJB. We show that the chosen genotypes (C57BL/6J and B6D2F1N) and environments ("scarce" and "complex") did not have a statistically significant influence on the responses in the CJB test. By contrast, they influenced anxiety-like behavior with C57BL/6J mice and mice from the "complex" environment displaying less anxiety-like behavior than B6D2F1N mice and mice from the "scarce" environment. As the selected genotypes and environments did not explain the existing differences in CJB, future studies might investigate the impact of other genotypes and environmental conditions on CJB, and additionally, elucidate the role of other potential causes like endocrine profiles and epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we show that individual differences in CJB were repeatable over a period of seven weeks, suggesting that CJB represents a temporally stable trait in laboratory mice. Therefore, we encourage the further study of CJB within an animal personality framework.

AB  - Exposure to stress and prolonged exposure to alcohol leads to neuronal damages in several brain regions, being the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) one of the most affected. These changes presumably reduce the ability of the organism to cope with these stimuli and may underlie a series of maladaptive behaviours among which include drug addiction and withdrawal. Drug-addicted individuals show a pattern of behavior similar to patients with lesions of the mPFC. This impairment in the decision-making could be one of the mechanisms responsible for the transition from the casual to compulsive drug use. The environmental enrichment (EE) has a protective effect on the neural and cognitive impairments induced by psychoactive drugs, including ethyl alcohol. The present study aims to determine the influence of withdrawal from intermittent long-term alcohol exposure on alcohol preference, emotional reactivity and neural aspects of early isolated or grouped reared rats kept under standard or complex environments and the influence of social isolation on these measures, as well. Our results point out new insights on this matter showing that the EE can attenuate the adverse effects of withdrawal and social isolation on rat's behavior. This effect is probably due to its protective action on the mPFC integrity, including the cingulate area 1 (Cg1), and the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic cortex (IL), what could account for the absence of changes in the emotional reactivity in EE alcohol withdrawal rats. We argue that morphological changes at these cortical levels can afford the emotional, cognitive and behavioural dysregulations verified following withdrawal from chronic alcohol intake.

AB  - Early life immune activation has negative effects on the development of central nervous system and cognitive function, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that inflammation induces changes in microglia morphology, which lead to excessive synaptic pruning and improper function of neural circuits. Therefore, we hypothesized that early immune activation induced microglia activation, contributing to synaptic and cognitive impairments in adolescent mice. To establish the animal model of early immune activation, pups received a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 mu g/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on postnatal 10 (P10). Environmental enrichment (EE) was conducted four hours per day during P10-P38. Behavioral tests were performed by open field (P39), elevated plus-maze (P40) and Y maze tests (P41). The protein levels of glutamic acid decarboxylas67 (GAD67), parvalbumin (PV), vesicular gaba amino acid transporter (vGAT) and vesicular glutamate transporters (vGLUT1) were determined in the hippocampi and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)/p65, NF-kappa B/p50, interleukin-113 (IL-113), tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined in the hippocampi. The dendritic spine density was evaluated in the CA1 of the hippocampus. In our study, we showed that early life LPS exposure induced microglia activation and excessive inhibitory synapse engulfment, decreased number of perisomatic puncta on both inhibitory PV interneurons and excitatory neurons, which might contribute to excitation/inhibition imbalance, dendritic spine loss, and cognitive impairment in adolescent mice. Notably, EE rescued most of these abnormalities and improved cognitive impairment. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that reduced inhibition might contribute to early life LPS exposure induced-cognitive impairment. We also provided the possibility of the protective role of EE in rescuing these long-term adverse effects.

AB  - This study investigated effects of different forms of environmental enrichment on behavioral, endocrinological, and immunological parameters in male mice. For this purpose, animals of the inbred strain CS were kept in groups of four males under three different housing conditions: (A) nonstructured Makrolon type III laboratory cages ("standard-housing" = S); (B) equivalent laboratory cages that were enriched with a box and a scaffolding ("enriched-housing" = E); and (C) spacious terraria that were structured richly ("super-enriched-housing" = SE). Both forms of enrichment caused a sharp rise in aggressive behavior, though play behavior was increased in E and SE mice, too. Levels of sociopositive behaviors in S and SE mice were higher than those in E mice. Plasma corticosterone concentrations and adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activities were significantly increased in male mice kept in both forms of enriched cages, indicating an activation of the pituitary-adrenocortical and the adrenomedullary systems. The behavioral and endocrinological differences were partly reflected by immunological parameters: SE mice had levels of IgG1 and ratios of IFN-gamma/IL-10 and IL-2/IL-10 significantly lower than those of S mice. Ratios of IgG2a/IgG1 were significantly higher in SE mice. The absolute percentages of CD8 cells in E-mice were significantly lower than those in S mice. Despite the elevated levels of stress hormones under both forms of enriched housing, the behavioral parameters also indicate positive effects of the enrichment, especially on SE animals. Obviously, an environmental enrichment is beneficial for male mice as long as the spatial conditions are generous enough to allow coping with the increased aggression brought about by the enrichment.

AB  - Compared to peers raised in well-resourced, 'enriched' environments ('EE'), female laboratory mice from conventional barren cages are more aggressive to their cage-mates, and less sociable with familiar non-cage-mates (especially if these too are from conventional housing, 'CH'). But how do such effects occur? Using Social Approach Tests, and middle-aged mice whose lifelong behavioural time budgets were known, we re-tested the hypotheses that CH C57/BL6 ('C57') subjects paired with non-cage-mate 'stimulus mice' would, compared to EE C57 subjects, be less sociable, less socially attractive, and more agonistic to unfamiliar conspecifics. We also assessed whether any effects reflected that subject mice had, over their lifespans, been involved in more agonistic interactions with cage-mates, and/or spent much of their time inactive but awake ('IBA' - a depressive-like behaviour) or performing stereotypic behaviour. Results replicated previous findings: CH C57 subjects were less sociable with non cage-mates than were EE C57s (especially when inferred from sniffing conspecifics versus novel objects). Results also revealed that CH subjects' reduced sociability was best explained by their elevated agonism in their home cages, as well as by how much they were aggressed themselves by their cage-mates. Additional, albeit less robust, roles were also played by displaying lifelong high levels of IBA and SB. Furthermore, although CH subjects were no more aggressive than EE subjects towards stimulus mice, BALB/c ('BALB') stimulus mice were much more agonistic to CH subjects than to EE subjects. As additional evidence that mice can discriminate between CH and EE conspecifics, housing also affected BALBs' social attractiveness: EE BALBs tended to be preferred over CH BALBs by subject mice. We could not ascertain how mice distinguished between differentially housed peers, but these results suggest hitherto unsuspected social abilities for BALBs (typically characterised as 'anti-social' when CH): if EE, or faced with EE companions, mice of this strain se mice seem attractive and affiliative. Overall, lifelong poor welfare in barren housing can thus negatively impact social behaviour in middle-aged female mice. Results broadly suggest that the individuals most adversely affected by CH conditions also show the most reduced sociability. 'Enriched' cages may therefore enhance welfare, not only by physically enabling natural behaviours, but also by promoting positive social interactions. How mice discriminate between EE and CH conspecifics now needs investigating.

AB  - This paper reports on ethnographic research conducted in a behavioural epigenetics laboratory working on the transgenerational inheritance of "early-life stress" in rodents. The article describes the experimental steps that lead to the production of an understanding of "stress" as a nexus of molecules and experiences, biological and biographical events. In particular, the paper focuses on the experimental protocol of Environmental Enrichment (EE). EE is a housing regime for experimental animals that the lab employs to correct the 'aberrant' epigenetic effects of 'stress'. The use of EE gets narrated as a therapeutic intervention restoring, within the experimental system of the lab, the centrality of the body as entity endlessly modified by the interactions with its (material and social) environments. Drawing from these observations, I detail the lab's mixed factual and value-laden work going into the production of a biosocial understanding of "stress". This process, I argue, oscillates between an emphasis on the material, organic and molecular traces of experiences, and circumscribed attempts to deal with the biosocial complexities of this phenomenon in experimentation. As such, the practices reported here may be of interest to current STS engagements with post-genomic science and the way it forays into complex thinking of body-environment entanglements.

AB  - The development of new pharmacological therapies starts with target discovery. Finding new therapeutic targets for anxiety disorders is a difficult process. Most of the currently described drugs for post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) are based on the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. The mechanism of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was already described in 1977 (Benkert et al. 1977). Now, almost 40 years later,we still rely on the same mechanism of action and more effective pharmacological therapies, based on other working mechanisms, are not on the market yet. Finding new molecular switches that upon modulation cure or alleviate the disorder is hampered by a lack of valid animal models. Many of the characteristics of psychiatric disorders are typically human and hence animal models feature only part of the underlying pathology. In this review we define a set of criteria for animal models of PTSD. First,we describe the symptomatology and pathology of PTSD and the current pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options. Next, we compare three often-used animal models and analyze how these models comply with the set of criteria. Finally, we discuss how resolving the underlying mechanisms of effective non-pharmacological treatments (environmental enrichment, re-exposure) may aid therapeutic target discovery.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia. It occurs when the cerebral blood supply is reduced by disarrangement of the circulatory system. Environmental enrichment (EE) has been associated with cognitive improvement, motor function recovery, and anxiety relief with respect to various neurodegenerative diseases and emotional stress models. The purpose of this study was to determine whether long-term EE influenced cognitive impairment in a rat model of chronic hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAo). The Y-maze and Morris water maze tests were performed to evaluate the rats' cognitive functions. Also, the protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated cAMP-calcium response element binding protein (pCREB), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were confirmed by Western blot. The microvessels and angiogenesis-associated proteins in the hippocampal region were investigated using immunohistochemistry. The VaD + EE group showed significantly better cognitive functions than the VaD group in both the Y-maze and MWM tests. In addition, the VaD + EE group showed significantly increased expression of BDNF, pCREB, and VEGF in the hippocampus compared to the VaD group. Rats in the VaD + EE group also had increased length of microvessels and VEGF expression in the hippocampus. These results suggest that long-term EE exerts neuroprotective effects against cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion through the enhancement of BDNF, pCREB, and VEGF expression and indicate that EE may be a good nursing intervention in vascular dementia patients.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) can improve the welfare of captive fish. Its objective is to provide new sensorial and motor stimulation in order to help meet their behavioural, physiological, morphological and psychological needs, whilst reducing stress and frequency of abnormal behaviours. In fish farms, rearing environments are usually designed from a human perspective and based on economic requirements, mainly for practical reasons for the farmer, with little consideration for animal welfare. Throughout aquaculture production cycles, many farming operations can be stressful for fish, and EE may not only help them cope with these stressful events but also improve their overall welfare. In recent years, increasing interest on the effects of EE in captive fish has focussed mainly on structural enrichment. However, there are many other enrichment strategies that merit attention (e.g. sensorial, occupational, social and dietary enrichment) and which may be of interest for fish farming. Here, we review in depth the existing literature on EE and its effects on the welfare of a wide range of farmed fish species, discussing the feasibility and potential applications of different EE strategies to promote fish welfare at a commercial scale. We also present a practical framework to address the design, validation and implementation of EE by the aquaculture industry, taking in consideration the technical challenges of providing enrichment for farmed fish.

AB  - Simple Summary In order to ensure species-appropriate horse keeping and management, knowledge about horses' cognitive abilities is essential. One parameter used to measure the cognitive abilities of a species is their capacity for innovative behavior. In this study 16 horses where confronted with a novel problem, i.e., an unknown feeder. When a horse emptied the feeder completely it was considered to be innovative. We found 25% of the horses to be innovative. Horses' propensity to innovate was mediated by individual behavioral differences and former life experiences. We conclude that horses' keeping conditions and welfare may be improved by environmental enrichment which promotes the development of innovative behavior.
   Abstract Domesticated horses are constantly confronted with novel tasks. A recent study on anecdotal data indicates that some are innovative in dealing with such tasks. However, innovative behavior in horses has not previously been investigated under experimental conditions. In this study, we investigated whether 16 horses found an innovative solution when confronted with a novel feeder. Moreover, we investigated whether innovative behavior in horses may be affected by individual aspects such as: age, sex, size, motor and sensory laterality, fecal stress hormone concentrations (GCMs), and task-related behavior. Our study revealed evidence for 25% of the horses being capable of innovative problem solving for operating a novel feeder. Innovative horses of the present study were active, tenacious, and may be considered to have a higher inhibitory control, which was revealed by their task related behavior. Furthermore, they appeared to be emotional, reflected by high baseline GCM concentrations and a left sensory and motor laterality. These findings may contribute to the understanding of horses' cognitive capacities to deal with their environment and calls for enriched environments in sports and leisure horse management.

AB  - Although loneliness is a human experience, it can be estimated in laboratory animals deprived from physical contact with conspecifics. Rodents under social isolation (SI) tend to develop emotional distress and cognitive impairment. However, it is still to be determined whether those conditions present a common neural mechanism. Here, we conducted a series of behavioral, morphological, and neurochemical analyses in adult mice that underwent to 1 week of SI. We observed that SI mice display a depressive-like state that can be prevented by enriched environment, and the antidepressants fluoxetine (FLX) and desipramine (DES). Interestingly, chronic administration of FLX, but not DES, was able to counteract the deleterious effect of SI on social memory. We also analyzed cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and astrogenesis after the treatment with antidepressants. Our results showed that the olfactory bulb (OB) was the neurogenic niche with the highest increase in neurogenesis after the treatment with FLX. Considering that after FLX treatment social memory was rescued and depressive-like behavior decreased, we propose neurogenesis in the OB as a possible mechanism to unify the FLX ability to counteract the deleterious effect of SI.

AB  - The environmental context during gestation may modulate the postpartum variations in maternal behaviors observed within different animal species. Most of our experimental knowledge on this phenomenon and its physiological effects have been gained by confronting the pregnant mother with stressful situations, with the consensual results indicating a reduced maternal behavior and a hyper reactivity of stress-related neural paths. Here, in contrast, by exposing nulliparous rats strictly during pregnancy to a standard laboratory environment (STD) or a highly stimulating sensory and social environment (EE), we investigated the hypothesis that subjects frequently exposed to social stimuli and novel situations during pregnancy will show postpartum changes in subcortical brain areas' activity related to the processing of social stimuli and novelty, such that there will be modifications in maternal behavior. We found that EE mothers doubled the levels of licking and grooming, and active hovering over pups during the first postpartum week than STD dams, without a difference in the time of contact with the pups. Associated with these behaviors, EE dams showed increased c-Fos immunoreaction in hypothalamic nuclei and distinct responses in amygdalar nuclei, than STD dams. In the maternal defensive test, EE dams tripled the levels of aggressive behaviors of the STD rats. Additionally, in two different tests, EE mothers showed lower levels of postpartum anxiety-like behaviors when confronted with novel situations. Our results demonstrate that the activity of brain areas related to social behavior is adaptable by environmental circumstances experienced during gestation, presumably to prepare the progeny for these particular conditions.

AB  - Individual variation in responses to commonly used tests of anxiety and spatial memory is often reported. While this variation is frequently considered to be 'noise', evidence suggests that it is, at least partially, related to consistent individual differences in behavioral responses (i.e., personality). The same tests used to assess anxiety are often used to profile personality traits, but personality differences are rarely considered when testing treatment differences in anxiety. Focusing on the rat literature, we describe fundamental principles involved in anxiety and spatial memory tests and we discuss how personality differences and housing conditions can in-fluence behavioral responses in these tests. We propose that an opportunity exists to increase stress resiliency in environmentally sensitive individuals by providing environmental enrichment. We conclude by discussing different approaches to incorporating personality measures into the design and analysis of future studies; given the potential that variation masks research outcomes, we suggest that a strategy which considers the individual and its housing can contribute to improving research reproducibility.

AB  - Despite reported findings, explanations for within-species variation in behavioural performance on cognitive tests are still understudied. Cognitive processes are influenced by environmental and genetic differences, where cognitive stimulation and monoaminergic systems are predicted to be important. To explore explanations for individual variation in impulsivity (a behaviour that is negatively correlated with inhibitory control), we experimentally altered the environment of red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, by exposing chicks from newly hatched to 9 weeks old to either (1) both environmental and cognitive enrichment, (2) environmental enrichment without additional cognitive enrichment or (3) neither environmental nor cognitive enrichment. Subsequently, we measured variation in impulsivity and brain gene expression of genes from the dopaminergic system (DRD1 and DRD2) and serotonergic system (5HT2A, 5HT1B, 5HT2B, 5HT2C and TPH). We focused on two aspects of impulsivity, impulsive action and persistence, and their reduction over time. Cognitively enriched chicks tended to have higher initial impulsive action and had higher initial persistence, and our environmentally enriched chicks had slower reduction of impulsive action over time. DRD2 (a dopamine receptor gene) had lower expression in environmentally enriched chicks. Variation in impulsive action tended to correlate with expression of TPH (a gene involved in serotonin synthesis), whereas persistence correlated with both TPH and the dopamine receptor gene DRD1, and tended to correlate with the dopaminergic gene DRD2, regardless of rearing treatment. These results indicate that both environment and links to neurobiology could explain initial individual variation in, and reduction of, impulsivity. Further, distinct neurobiological pathways appear to govern impulsive action versus persistence, supporting the suggestion that impulsivity is a heterogenic behaviour. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Effects of enriched environment (EE) combined with fluoxetine in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) rat model were examined in our study. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group, CUS group, CUS + EE group, CUS + fluoxetine group, and CUS + EE + fluoxetine group (n = six per group). Rats in the CUS group were bred under conditions of CUS and separation for 6 weeks; Control group animals were bred in group cages (three rats per cage) under standard laboratory conditions for 6 weeks; Rats in CUS + EE group, CUS + fluoxetine group, and CUS + EE + fluoxetine groups were bred under the conditions of CUS and separation for 6 weeks and had an intervention of EE, an oral gavage of fluoxetine, and an intervention of EE + oral gavage of fluoxetine, respectively, every day for the final 3 weeks. Every rat underwent a behavioral assessment at the beginning of the 1st week, at the end of the 3rd week and at the end of the 6th week. Behavioral assessments included sucrose water consumption, weight measurement, and an open field test (measuring horizontal moving distance, rearing behavior, and defecation). Finally, the level of synaptophysin expressed in the hippocampus was measured with immunohistochemistry. We found that EE, fluoxetine, and EE + fluoxetine all reversed the depression-like behaviors of CUS rats. The effect of EE + fluoxetine appeared to be superior to EE or fluoxetine alone; the expression level of synaptophysin in CA1, CA3, and DG of the hippo campus was decreased in CUS rats, however, exposure to EE, fluoxetine, and EE + fluoxetine all reversed this decrease.

AB  - The aging process and age-related diseases all involve metabolic decline and impaired ability to cope with adversity. Environmental enrichment (EE)-a housing environment which recapitulates aspects of active lifestyle-exerts a wide range of health benefits in laboratory rodents. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hypothalamus orchestrates autonomic and neuroendocrine processes, serving as one key brain mediator of EE-induced resistance to obesity, cancer, and autoimmunity. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated hypothalamic BDNF gene transfer alleviates obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndromes in both diet-induced and genetic models. One recent study by our lab demonstrates the efficacy and safety of a built-in autoregulatory system to control transgene BDNF expression, mimicking the body's natural feedback systems in middle-age mice. Twelve-month old mice were treated with autoregulatory BDNF vector and monitored for 7 months. BDNF gene transfer prevented age-associated metabolic decline by: reducing adiposity, preventing the decline of brown fat activity, increasing adiponectin while reducing leptin and insulin in circulation, improving glucose tolerance, increasing energy expenditure, alleviating hepatic steatosis, and suppressing inflammatory genes in the hypothalamus and adipose tissues. Furthermore, BDNF treatment reduced anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. This chapter summarizes this work and discusses potential roles that hypothalamic BDNF might play in promoting healthy aging.

AB  - Maternal deprivation (MD) causes cognitive deficits that persist until adulthood. Thereby, the environmental enrichment (EE) is widely used to increase brain plasticity. Here, pregnant female rats were used and their offspring were submitted to neonatal MD from post-natal day 1-10; after weaning the rats were submitted to EE. MD caused deficits on short and long-term aversive and recognition memory and on cognitive flexibility tested on reversed Morris Water Maze test. MD also promoted the decrease of hippocampal Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) protein expression. The EE was able to protect against the cognitive deficits, avoiding the memory and the cognitive flexibility disrupting, and normalizing hippocampal BDNF expression of rats submitted to MD. These data confirms that MD promotes long-life memory deficits and demonstrates that MD causes cognitive flexibility disruption; the mechanisms seem involve the decrease of BDNF. We also demonstrate that EE, which improves BDNF, is able to avoid memory deficits and cognitive flexibility disrupts.

AB  - Background: Neonatal maternal separation (NMS), a major kind of early life stress, increases the risk of visceral pain, anxiety-and depression-like behaviors in adulthood. An enriched environment (EE) has been shown to successfully rescue the brain from various early life psychological stressors. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether NMS induces visceral pain, anxiety-and depression-like behaviors in adolescents and to evaluate the impact of EE in infancy on these symptoms.Methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice that had been subjected to NMS were used in this study. The visceral pain threshold test (PTT), open field test (OFT), and sucrose preference test (SPT) were conducted to evaluate visceral pain, anxiety-and depression-like behaviors in mice, respectively. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10, (IL-10), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) was performed to assess neuroinflammatory responses. Then, the effects of EE (free-turning running wheels, pipes, stairs, and various colored ocean balls, etc.) on NMS-induced behaviors and neuroinflammatory factors were examined.Results: The impacts of NMS included adolescent visceral pain, anxiety-and depression-like behaviors. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were biased towards pro-inflammatory features. Further, EE alleviated adolescent visceral pain, anxiety-and depression-like behaviors. The application of EE up-regulated the expression of IL-10, and down-regulated the expression of IL-10 and TNF-alpha in mPFC, BLA, and PVN.Conclusions: The effects of NMS include adolescent visceral pain, anxiety-and depression-like behaviors, accompanied by an imbalance of neuroinflammation. Intervention with EE in pediatric mice relieved these symptoms by reducing neuroinflammation in the central nervous system.

AB  - Living in big cities might involuntarily expose people to high levels of noise causing auditory and/or extra-auditory impairments, including adverse effects on central nervous system (CNS) areas such as the hippocampus. In particular, CNS development is a very complex process that can be altered by environmental stimuli. We have previously shown that noise exposure of developing rats can induce hippocampal-related behavioral alterations. However, noise-induced biochemical alterations had not been studied yet. Thus, the aim of this work was to assess whether early noise exposure can affect rat hippocampal oxidative state and aminoacidergic neurotransmission tone. Additionally, the effectiveness of an enriched environment (EE) as a neuroprotective strategy was evaluated. Male Wistar rats were exposed to different noise schemes at 7 or 15 days after birth. Upon weaning, some animals were transferred to an EE whereas others were kept in standard cages. Short- and long-term measurements were performed to evaluate reactive oxygen species, thioredoxins levels and catalase activity as indicators of hippocampal oxidative status as well as glutamic acid decarboxylase and a subtype of glutamate transporter to evaluate aminoacidergic neurotransmission tone. Results showed noise-induced changes in hippocampal oxidative state and aminoacidergic neurotransmission markers that lasted until adolescence and differed according to the scheme and the age of exposure. Finally, EE housing was effective in preventing some of these changes. These findings suggest that CNS development seems to be sensitive to the effects of stressors such as noise, as well as those of an environmental stimulation, favoring prompt and lasting molecular changes.

AB  - Background: Inflammation mediated by microglia has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. The enriched environment (EE) can improve depression-like behaviors and reduce inflammatory reactions, but it is unclear whether this is by changing the inflammatory activation phenotype of microglia.
   Method: A depression rat model was established using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for four weeks. The rats were then treated with EE or fluoxetine administration during the following three weeks. Behavior tests including sucrose preference, forced swimming and open field were applied to evaluate the depression-like behaviors of rats at the baseline period prior to CUS, the end of fourth week and at the end of the seventh week. Microglial activation and hippocampal neuro-inflammation were detected on postmortem using immunofluorescence, western blotting, and real-time polymerase reaction (PCR).
   Result: The results showed that severe depressive-like behavior was induced by four weeks of CUS. Changes in peripheral blood inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA. Immunofluorescent staining showed the IBA-1 of microglia activation marker level significantly increased in affected rats. The hippocampal microglial activation state was determined by measuring the increased levels of iNOS an M1 marker and the decreased levels of CD206, an M2 marker. The activation of NF-kappa B upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and factors such as IL-10 were decreased. This study showed that EE and chronic fluoxetine treatment alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by chronic stress and significantly inhibited microglial activation, activated NF-kappa B inflammasome and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines.
   Conclusion: EE can alleviate depression-like behavior by modulating the phenotype of microglia, inhibiting pro inflammatory genes, and promoting anti-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, EE can effectively reduce the phosphorylation and expression levels of NF-kappa B.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) produces a remarkable degree of structural and functional plasticity in the hippocampus and possible mediators of these changes, such as glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), are of considerable interest. GRs are richly expressed in the hippocampus and they are involved in the adaptation to stressors and facilitate active coping in anxious situations. In this study, we assessed the effect of an EE protocol (24 h/day during 69 days) in adult Wistar rats on the activity in the elevated-zero maze (EZM), performance in the holeboard task (HB) and we also examined the changes in the glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) expression in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1, CA3 and DG). Our EE protocol reduced anxious behaviors in the EZM, so the animals spent more time and made more entries into the open sections. In the HB task, the enriched group showed more explorative behavior, a reduction of anxiety-related behaviors and a better cognitive performance compared to non-enriched animals. With regard to the GR expression, the EE condition produced an increase in the number of immunopositive cells for GRs in CA1, CA3 and DG. These results suggest that the better performance of enriched animals could be mediated in part by the increase of GRs in the dorsal hippocampus, which may alter the hippocampal neuronal function and accordingly, the anxiety levels, the spatial memory performance and the exploration levels in these animals.

AB  - Postnatal development of the brain is characterized by sensitive windows during which, local circuitry are drastically reshaped by life experiences. These critical periods (CPs) occur at different time points for different brain functions, presenting redundant physiological changes in the underlying brain regions. Although circuits malleability during CPs provides a valuable window of opportunity for adaptive fine-tuning to the living environment, this aspect of neurodevelopment also represents a phase of increased vulnerability for the development of a variety of disorders. Consistently, accumulating epidemiological studies point to adverse childhood experience as a major risk factor for many medical conditions, especially stress- and anxiety-related conditions. Thanks to creative approaches to manipulate rodents' rearing environment, neurobiologist have uncovered a pivotal interaction between CPs and early-life experiences, offering an interesting landscape to improve our understanding of brain disorders. In this short review, we discuss how early-life experience impacts cellular and molecular players involved in CPs of development, translating into long-lasting behavioral consequences in rodents. Bringing together findings from multiple laboratories, we delineate a unifying theory in which systemic factors dynamically target the maturation of brain functions based on adaptive needs, shifting the balance between resilience and vulnerability in response to the quality of the rearing environment.

AB  - In this study, we sought to learn whether adverse events such as chronic restraint stress (CRS), or 'nurture' in the form of environmental enrichment (EE), could modify depression-like behavior and blood biomarker transcript levels in a genetic rat model of depression. The Wistar Kyoto More Immobile (WMI) is a genetic model of depression that aided in the identification of blood transcriptomic markers, which successfully distinguished adolescent and adult subjects with major depressive disorders from their matched no-disorder controls. Here, we followed the effects of CRS and EE in adult male WMIs and their genetically similar control strain, the Wistar Kyoto Less Immobile (WLI), that does not show depression-like behavior, by measuring the levels of these transcripts in the blood and hippocampus. In WLIs, increased depression-like behavior and transcriptomic changes were present in response to CRS, but in WMIs no behavioral or additive transcriptomic changes occurred. Environmental enrichment decreased both the inherent depression-like behavior in the WMIs and the behavioral difference between WMIs and WLIs, but did not reverse basal transcript level differences between the strains. The inverse behavioral change induced by CRS and EE in the WLIs did not result in parallel inverse expression changes of the transcriptomic markers, suggesting that these behavioral responses to the environment work via separate molecular pathways. In contrast, 'trait' transcriptomic markers with expression differences inherent and unchanging between the strains regardless of the environment suggest that in our model, environmental and genetic etiologies of depression work through independent molecular mechanisms.

AB  - While the positive effects of environmental enrichment (EE) applied after weaning, in adulthood, during aging, or even in the presence of brain damage have been widely described, the transgenerational effects of pre-reproductive EE have been less examined. And yet, this issue is remarkable given that parental environmental experience may imprint offspring's phenotype over generations through many epigenetic processes. Interactions between individual and environment take place lifelong even before conception. In fact, the environment pre-reproductively experienced by the mother and/or the father exerts a substantial impact on neural development and motor and cognitive performances of the offspring, even if not directly exposed to social, cognitive, physical and/or motor enrichment. Furthermore, pre-reproductive parental enrichment exerts a transgenerational impact on coping response to stress as well as on the social behavior of the offspring. Among the effects of pre-reproductive parental EE, a potentiation of the maternal care and a decrease in global methylation levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the progeny have been described. Finally, pre-reproductive EE modifies different pathways of neuromodulation in the brain of the offspring (involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor, oxytocin and glucocorticoid receptors). The present review highlights the importance of pre-reproductive parental enrichment in altering the performances not only of animals directly experiencing it, but also of their progeny, thus opening the way to new hypotheses on the inheritance mechanisms of behavioral traits.

AB  - Adult animal behaviors are determined by complex and dynamic changes in gene expression in different brain regions and are influenced by life experiences and environmental exposures. These stimuli affect gene expression through intricate mechanisms of regulation that largely implicate epigenetic factors, such as, DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Through these molecular pathways, some of the behavioral phenotypes associated with life experiences can be stably transmitted to descendants, sometimes across several generations. Rodent studies indicate that parental stressful and traumatic experiences can lead to behavioral despair, risk-taking behaviors, altered sociability and atypical responses to stressful stimuli in the offspring, whereas parental environmental enrichment has been associated with improved cognition and stress resilience in the offspring. Similar observations have been made in humans; children and grandchildren of genocide survivors show increased psychopathology and emotional disturbances. At the molecular level, changes in germline ncRNAs have been identified as likely vectors of transmission in rodents. The mechanisms linking behavioral stimuli to the germline, and factors responsible for these changes and their persistence across generations remain, however, largely unidentified.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the impact of an enriched environment in a previously established stress model of isolation during early development that induces high alcohol (ethanol) self-administration. The study was conducted with male and female C57BL/6J mice housed in isolation or in groups that were either provided or withheld enrichment during adolescence. The impact of these housing conditions was assessed during adulthood by measuring weight gain, quantifying voluntary ethanol intake, measuring plasma corticosterone levels, and assessing anxiety-like behavior. Results showed that, regardless of sex, mice that were single-housed during adolescence showed a significant increase in voluntary ethanol intake, which was not observed in isolated mice that were provided with nesting material during adolescence (compared to group-housed non-enriched control group). Basal corticosterone was not affected by housing, enrichment conditions, or sex. Corticosterone levels did not relate to levels of voluntary ethanol intake. However, corticosterone levels were higher after three weeks of ethanol intake. Surprisingly, mice that were group-housed during adolescence showed higher levels of anxietylike behavior in the light/dark test. Overall, these results indicate that housing conditions during a criticd1 developmental period can significantly modulate voluntary ethanol intake later in life. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Early life is a decisive stage for the development of physiological and psychological characteristics of an individual. Any stress or disruption of healthy development at this stage has serious long-lasting consequences for the remaining life. Unfortunately, early life stress is a common occurrence in humans and other animals. In this context, we investigated if the provision of environmental enrichment during the pre-weaning phase of rat pups and dams could alter the consequences of early-life maternal-separation stress. Pre-weaning enrichment rescued the effects of maternal separation on the excess secretion of adrenal stress hormones and anxiety-like behavior during adulthood. Enrichment also reduced the effect of stress on the spine density of basolateral amygdala neurons, a brain region critical for stress-induced facilitation of emotional behaviors. Pre-weaning enrichment, provided during early-life, blunted the effects of maternal separation stress on decreased intra-nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptors within the amygdala neurons when tested later in adulthood. Early-life, pre-weaning environmental enrichment also increased the amount of brain-derived neurotrophic factor within adult basolateral amygdala. Our observations showed that environmental manipulation during early formative years could be utilized to build lifelong resilience to stress. Complex naturalistic housing and sensory enrichment is, thus, an useful buffer against an impoverished and stressful childhood.

AB  - Cognitive bias has become a popular way to access non-human animal mood, though inconsistent results have been found. In humans, mood and personality interact to determine cognitive bias, but to date, this has not been investigated in non-human animals. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in a non-human animal, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus), that mood and personality interact, impacting on judgement. Pigs with a more proactive personality were more likely to respond optimistically to unrewarded ambiguous probes (spatially positioned between locations that were previously rewarded and unrewarded) independent of their housing (or enrichment) conditions. However, optimism/pessimism of reactive pigs in this task was affected by their housing conditions, which are likely to have influenced their mood state. Reactive pigs in the less enriched environment were more pessimistic and those in the more enriched environment, more optimistic. These results suggest that judgement in non-human animals is similar to humans, incorporating aspects of stable personality traits and more transient mood states.

AB  - Previous studies indicate that individuals exposed to stress in juvenility are more prone to suffer from stress related psychopathologies in adulthood. Evidence suggests that exposure to enriched environment (EE) conditions alleviates juvenile stress (JVS) effects. Exposure to stress has been found to affect immune responses to challenges, but whether JVS has long-term effects on inflammatory processes remains unclear. Here, we examined the impact of JVS on inflammatory processes in adulthood, and the effects of exposure to EE conditions. Adult rats exposed to JVS showed elevated levels of blood monocytes after induction of peritoneal inflammation. This was associated with higher concentration of blood chemokine ligand type 2 (CCL2), but lower levels of its receptor, chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) on these monocytes, indicating reduced ability of these monocytes to be recruited to the inflammatory site. In accordance, JVS led to reduced levels of recruited macrophages at the peritoneal cavity, as well as a reduced activation ratio for the release of peritoneal interleukin-10 (IL-10) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation. EE conditions, which fully reversed the anxiety-like behavior resulting from exposure to JVS, did not reverse JVS-induced alterations in blood concentration of monocytes or peritoneal macrophages, but affected IL-10 activation ratio. This effect was associated with a compensatory elevation of the peritoneal CCL2-CCR2 axis. Our results demonstrate long-term metaplasticity-like effects of JVS, which alter inflammatory processes in response to immune challenges in adulthood. Our results also raise the possibility that EE does not simply reverse the effects of JVS but rather indirectly modulates its impact.

AB  - Drug addiction is a chronic disorder comprising components of both impulsivity and compulsivity in the so called "addiction cycle" which develops over time from early non-dependent, repetitive, binge-consumption to later post-dependent compulsive consumption. Thus, frequent binge-like intake is a typical pattern of excessive drug intake characteristic of the pre-dependent phase of the addiction cycle, which represent an important risk factor to develop addiction in vulnerable individuals. In this framework, it is of paramount interest to further understand the earliest stage of the addiction cycle so novel approaches would emerge aimed to control repetitive episodes of binge-consumption in non-dependent subjects, protecting vulnerable individuals from transition to dependence. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a preclinical animal model in which animals are housed under novel, social enriched conditions, which allows exercising and provides sensory and cognitive stimulation. EE promotes important improvements for a variety of cognitive processes and clear therapeutic and protective effects preventing ethanol (EtOH) and drug addiction as well. Interestingly, recent observations suggest that EE might additionally modulate binge-like intake of highly palatable caloric substances, including EtOH, which suggests the ability of EE to regulate consumption during the initial stage of the addiction cycle. We have proposed that EE protective and therapeutic effects on binge-consumption of palatable substances might primarily be mediated by the modulatory control that EE exerts on anxiety and impulsivity/compulsivity traits, which are all risk factors favoring transition to drug addiction.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world, being characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta. PD pharmacotherapy has been based on dopamine replacement in the striatum with the dopaminergic precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) and/or with dopaminergic agonists, alongside anticholinergic drugs in order to mitigate the motor abnormalities. However, these practices neither prevent nor stop the progression of the disease. Environmental enrichment (EE) has effectively prevented several neurodegenerative processes, mainly in preclinical trials. Several studies have demonstrated that EE induces biological changes, bearing on cognitive enhancement, neuroprotection, and on the attenuation of the effects of stress, anxiety, and depression. Herein, we investigated whether EE could prevent the motor, biochemical, and molecular abnormalities in a murine model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridine (MPTP). Our results show that EE does not prevent the dopaminergic striatal depletion induced by MPTP, despite having averted the MPTP-induced hyperlocomotion. However, it was able to slow down and avoid, respectively, the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) depletion. Analysis of dopaminergic mRNA alterations in the midbrain showed that D1R expression was increased by MPTP, while the normal expression level of this receptor was restored by EE. As for the cholinergic system, MPTP led to a decrease in the ChAT gene expression while increasing the expression of both AChE and M1R. EE attenuated and prevented-respectively-ChAT and M1R gene expression alterations triggered by MPTP in the midbrain. Overall, our data brings new evidence supporting the neuroprotective potential of EE in PD, focusing on the interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic systems.

AB  - Background: Depression is often associated with an increase in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity and immune response. To investigate this relationship, we examined the consequences of environmental manipulation on the neural correlates of the HPA axis and immune response in an animal model of depression, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. Additionally, female animals are often overlooked in preclinical research because of the hormone fluctuations inherent in the estrous cycle. Methods: Female rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 environments for 30 days: (1) environmental enrichment (EE), (2) standard housing (SH), and (3) isolated housing (IH). Immunoreactivity of astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and microglia (Iba1) in the hippocampus and amygdala were measured using immunohistochemistry. Results: WKY animals had significantly more GR staining area and Iba1 staining intensity and area in the CA1 of the hippocampus. In enriched Wistar rats, GFAP staining intensity and area were greater in the CA1. A trend towards a greater percent of area stained with GR was found in WKY animals as compared to that of the Wistar animals. This was due to WKY females in EE having significantly higher GR staining intensity and area in the amygdala as compared to that of animals in SH. Discussion: These strain differences lend support to the use of WKY animals as an animal model of depression. Furthermore, due to the effects of EE on GFAP and GR staining in WKY females, we suggest that EE can be used as an intervention to potentially alleviate the negative effects of depression.

AB  - Neuro-inflammation is responsible for cognitive impairments and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the enriched environment (EE) effect on learning and memory impairment as well as on pro-inflammatory cytokines changes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS injection (1 mg/kg/i.p, days 1, 3, 5, and 7) was used to develop the animal model of neuro-inflammation. Twenty-eight male Wistar rats were used in the experiment and randomly divided into 4 groups: 1) sham (S), 2) sham + enriched environment (SE), 3) LPS (L), and 4) LPS + EE (LE). Two different housing conditions, including standard environment (SE) and enriched environment, were used. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was used to examine animals learning and memory. IL-1 beta, IL-10, and TNF-alpha levels were measured in the brain using ELISA. We found that LPS significantly impaired learning and memory (p < 0.05) in the MWM task, but EE could significantly improve learning and memory impairment (p < 0.05). IL-1 and IL-10 levels dramatically increased in the LPS group (P < 0.05), whereas EE could decrease and increase IL-1 beta and IL-10 values in the LPS + EE group (P < 0.05), respectively. TNF-alpha levels were traced but had not detectable values in the hippocampus. Thus, we can conclude that EE has healing effects on LPS induced neuro-inflammation and can improve learning and memory deficit; however, further studies are needed to support the findings of our study.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the tactile/handling stimulation (H) and environmental enrichment (EE) in well-nourished (C - 16% of protein) and malnourished (M - 6% of protein) rats tested in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) at 36 and 37 days of age. The results showed higher exploration of the open arms in the EPM in M as compared with C animals, as well as lower index of risk assessment behaviors, and EE, but not H, reversed the alterations produced by malnutrition in the EPM. Biochemical analysis showed higher levels of corticosterone in M when compared with C rats. The non-stimulated animals presented higher levels of polyamines in the hippocampus when compared with the stimulated ones in both diet conditions. It is suggested that both the lower anxiety levels and the lower risk-assessment behaviors in the EPM, as well as the higher levels of corticosterone, can be due to alterations in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as the result of early protein malnutrition.

AB  - Chronic exposure to stress has been demonstrated to increase the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the importance of effective therapeutic ways to overcome stress-related deficits, the present review focused on the therapeutic effects of environmental enrichment (EE) against chronic stress-induced cognitive-behavioral impairments. Chronic stress exposure has been shown to modify neuronal function and morphology in corticolimbic structures such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala, three brain regions greatly involved in mood regulation, fear processing, and cognition. It has been reported that chronic stress reduces brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and its mRNA expression on the PFC, suggesting that downregulation of BDNF is a possible mechanism that mediates the effect of stress on anxiety or depression-like behaviors. There is an increasing demand for findings of effective intervention methods for alleviating the detrimental effects of chronic stress. EE is a beneficial intervention for improving anxiety and depression-like behaviors. A large body of research revealed that exposure to EE improves several conditions, including degenerative diseases, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, anxiety, and depression. This article will provide an overview by discussing the influences of chronic stress on cognitive function and beneficial therapeutic effects of environmental enrichment (EE) against chronic stress.

AB  - We have studied the effect of an environmental enrichment (EE) protocol in adult Wistar rats on the activity in the elevated zero-maze (EZM), performance in the radial-arm water maze (RAWM) and we have also examined the changes in the neuronal metabolic activity of several brain regions related to anxiety response and spatial memory through cytochrome c oxidase histochemistry (COx). Our EE protocol had anxiolytic effect in the EZM; the animals spent more time and made more entries into the open quadrants, they had lower latency to enter into the open quadrant and lower levels of defecation. Also, the EE group showed fewer working memory and reference memory errors, as well as lesser distance travelled in the first day of the spatial training. In relation to the neuronal metabolic activity, EE reduced the COx activity in brain regions related to anxiety response, such as the infralimbic cortex, the paraventricular thalamic and hypothalamic nucleus, the basolateral amygdala, and the ventral hippocampus. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between groups in the dorsal hippocampus, more related to spatial cognition. These results suggest a beneficial effect of EE on spatial memory as a result of reducing anxiety levels and the COx activity in brain regions involved in anxiety response. We also found a differential pattern of activation inside the hippocampus, suggesting that the dorsal hippocarnpus has a preferential involvement in spatial learning and memory, whereas the ventral hippocampus has a role in anxiety response.

AB  - The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders involves complex interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Confirmed by several genome-wide association studies, Cacna1c represents one of the most robustly replicated psychiatric risk genes. Besides genetic predispositions, environmental stress such as childhood maltreatment also contributes to enhanced disease vulnerability. Both, Cacna1c gene variants and stressful life events are associated with morphological alterations in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics as a possible underlying mechanism of these regional brain abnormalities. In the present study, we simulated the interaction of psychiatric disease-relevant genetic and environmental factors in rodents to investigate their potential effect on brain mitochondrial function using a constitutive heterozygous Cacna1c rat model in combination with a four-week exposure to either post-weaning social isolation, standard housing, or social and physical environmental enrichment. Mitochondria were isolated from the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus to evaluate their bioenergetics, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and respiratory chain complex protein levels. None of these parameters were considerably affected in this particular gene-environment setting. These negative results were very robust in all tested conditions demonstrating that Cacna1c depletion did not significantly translate into altered bioenergetic characteristics. Thus, further investigations are required to determine the disease-related effects on brain mitochondria.

AB  - Determinants of lifetime health are complex and emphasize the need for robust predictors of disease risk. Allostatic load (AL) has become a clinical framework to estimate the cumulative biological burden associated with chronic stress. To assist knowledge translation in the developmental origins of health and disease field, clinically valid methods for reliable AL assessment in experimental models are urgently needed. Here, we introduce the rat cumulative allostatic load measure (rCALM), as a new preclinical knowledge translation tool to assess the burden of chronic stress. First, we identified an array of stress-associated physiological markers that are particularly sensitive to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation by ancestral prenatal stress. Second, we determined which of these markers are susceptible to an intervention by environmental enrichment (EE) to mitigate AL. The markers most responsive to stress and EE therapy were assembled to become operationalized in the rCALM. Third, the new rCALM was validated for the ability to indicate future disease risks. The results show that the rCALM estimates the burden of chronic stress and serves as a proxy to estimate stress resilience and vulnerability to disease. Using the rCALM we showed that enrichment therapy can offset the adverse health outcomes linked to a high AL. Thus, the rCALM provides a model for the development of new test strategies that facilitate knowledge translation in preclinical animal models.

AB  - Environmental enrichment has been proven to have positive effects on both behavioral and physiological phenotypes in rodent models of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we used mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor gene (Oprm1(-/-)), which has been shown to have deficits in social competence and communication, to assess the hypothesis that early enrichment can ameliorate sociability during development and adulthood. Due to the immaturity of sensory-motor capabilities of young pups, we chose as environmental stimulation a second lactating female, who provided extra maternal care and stimulation from birth. The results show that double mothering normalized the abnormal response to maternal separation in Oprm1(-/-) pups and increased social motivation in juveniles and adult knockout mice. Additionally, we observed that Oprm1(-/-) mice act as less attractive social partners than wild types, which suggests that social motivation can be modulated by the stimulus employed. This experiment supports previous findings suggesting that early social environmental stimulation has profound and long-term beneficial effects, encouraging the use of nonpharmacological interventions for the treatment of social defects in neurodevelopmental diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary The objectives of this study were to determine if housing Bovan brown laying hens in conventional cages or enriched floor pens impacted novel physiological and behavioral markers for animal welfare and whether we can use these markers to assess animal welfare. We found that birds that were housed in conventional cages showed increased tonic immobility durations (indication of fearfulness), decreased fecal Immunoglobulin A (indicator of immune function), and increased feather corticosterone concentrations (indicator of chronic stress) compared to hens that were housed in enriched pens. These results indicate that caged birds are more stressed, have reduced immune function, and are more fearful than birds that are housed in pens. In contrast to expectations, we found that caged hens showed a shorter latency to feed during attention bias testing, indicating reduced anxiety compared to birds from pens. Overall, we found that conventional cages generally impacted animal welfare negatively, with the exception of anxiety. In addition, the results suggest that the chosen novel markers for animal welfare show appropriate contrast between long-term housing systems for laying hens. Yet, additional work needs to be done before these measures can be used more broadly. The scientific community needs objective measures to appropriately assess animal welfare. The study objective was to assess the impact of housing system on novel physiological and behavioral measurements of animal welfare for laying hens, including secretory and plasma Immunoglobulin (IgA; immune function), feather corticosterone (chronic stress), and attention bias testing (ABT; anxiety), in addition to the well-validated tonic immobility test (TI; fearfulness). To test this, 184 Bovan brown hens were housed in 28 conventional cages (3 birds/cage) and 4 enriched pens (25 birds/pen). Feces, blood, and feathers were collected 4 times between week 22 and 43 to quantify secretory and plasma IgA and feather corticosterone concentrations. TI tests and ABT were performed once. Hens that were from cages tended to show longer TI, had increased feather corticosterone, and decreased secretory IgA at 22 weeks of age. The caged hens fed quicker, and more hens fed during the ABT compared to the penned hens. Hens that were in conventional cages showed somewhat poorer welfare outcomes than the hens in enriched pens, as indicated by increased chronic stress, decreased immune function at 22 weeks of age but no other ages, somewhat increased fear, but reduced anxiety. Overall, these novel markers show some appropriate contrast between housing treatments and may be useful in an animal welfare assessment context for laying hens. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Depression is caused by a variety of factors, especially stressful life events. Chronic stress-induced depression has detrimental effects on hippocampal integrity. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a beneficial intervention for improving anxiety, fear, and stress. We aimed to investigate the antidepressive effects of EE in a depressive rat model (DEP) that was subjected to chronic stress. The control group (n = 10) was kept under normal conditions, while depressive rats (n = 8 per group) were randomized into DEP, DEP + EE, and DEP + fluoxetine (Flx) groups. DEP + EE/Flx groups were exposed to standard housing and EE or Flx, respectively. The behavioral tests showed that hopelessness and anxiety were decreased in DEP + EE and DEP + Flx groups compared with the DEP group (p < .05). Similarly, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and tryptophan hydroxylase was significantly higher in the DEP + EE and DEP + Flx (p < .05) groups. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine receptor kinase B were also significantly higher in the DEP + EE and DEP + Flx groups compared with the DEP group (p < .05). Our findings can serve as a foundation for future investigations examining the effects of environmental improvement and physical exercise in patients with depression. This study suggests that EE may be useful for mitigating the detrimental effects of chronic stress in patients with depression.

AB  - The primary visual cortex (V1) is widely used to study brain plasticity, which is not only crucial for normal brain function, such as learning and memory, but also for recovery after brain injuries such as stroke. In standard cage (SC) raised mice, experience dependent ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in V1 declines with age and is compromised by a lesion in adjacent and distant cortical regions. In contrast, mice raised in an enriched environment (EE), exhibit lifelong OD plasticity and are protected from losing OD plasticity after a stroke-lesion in the somatosensory cortex. Since SC mice with an access to a running wheel (RW) displayed preserved OD plasticity during aging, we investigated whether physical exercise might also provide a plasticity promoting effect after a cortical stroke. To this end, we tested if adult RW-raised mice preserved OD plasticity after stroke and also if short-term running after stroke restored OD plasticity to SC mice. Indeed, unlike mice without a RW, adult RW mice continued to show OD plasticity even after stroke, and a 2 weeks RW experience after stroke already restored lost OD plasticity. Additionally, the experience-enabled increase of the spatial frequency and contrast threshold of the optomotor reflex of the open eye, normally lost after a stroke, was restored in both groups of RW mice. Our data suggest that physical exercise alone can not only preserve visual plasticity into old age, but also restore it after a cortical stroke.

AB  - Naturally, occurring variations in maternal care in the rat influence the sensitivity of offspring to stress in adulthood. The offspring of mothers that show lower levels of pup licking/grooming (i.e., low-LG mothers) demonstrate enhanced responses to stress and increased anxiety compared to those of high-LG mothers. Low-LG offspring are also more sensitive to the influence of environmental enrichment than high-LG offspring. This study, examined play, fighting in the juvenile offspring of high-LG and low-LG dams in a multiple-play, partners housing environment. Male offspring from low-LG dams demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of pouncing, pinning and aggressive social grooming than did high-LG males and high-LG and low-LG females. Consistent with earlier reports, male pups engaged in more play fighting than did females and maternal care was associated with differences in play fighting but only in males. Lower levels of stimulation in the form of LG from the dam during perinatal development may thus increase sensitivity for the stimulating effects of play behavior in periadolescence, in part explaining the increased solicitation of play, fighting through increased pouncing in the male offspring of the low-LG mothers. These findings identify a possible influence of variations in maternal care on play fighting and suggest that maternal care in the perinatal period influence social interactions during periadolescence.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has a beneficial effect on rodent behaviour, neuronal plasticity and brain function. Although it may also improve stress coping, it is not known whether EE influences the brain response to an external (psychological) stressor such as water avoidance stress (WAS) or an internal (systemic) stressor such as gastrointestinal inflammation. This study hence explored whether EE modifies WAS-induced activation of the mouse corticolimbic system and whether this stress response is altered by gastritis or colitis. Male C67BL/6N mice were housed under standard or enriched environment for 9 weeks, after which they were subjected to a 1-week treatment with oral iodoacetamide to induce gastritis or oral dextran sulfate sodium to induce colitis. Following exposure to WAS the expression of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was measured by immunocytochemistry. EE aggravated experimentally induced colitis, but not gastritis, as shown by an increase in the disease activity score and the colonic myeloperoxidase content. In the brain, EE enhanced the WAS-induced activation of the dentate gyrus and unmasked an inhibitory effect of gastritis and colitis on WAS-evoked c-Fos expression within this part of the hippocampus. Conversely, EE inhibited the WAS-evoked activation of the central amygdala and prevented the inhibitory effect of gastritis and colitis on WAS-evoked c-Fos expression in this region. EE, in addition, blunted the WAS-induced activation of the infralimbic cortex and attenuated the inhibitory effect of gastritis and colitis on WAS-evoked c-Fos expression in this area. These data reveal that EE has a region-specific effect on stress-induced c-Fos expression in the corticolimbic system, which is likely to improve stress resilience. The response of the prefrontal cortex - amygdala - hippocampus circuitry to psychological stress is also modified by the systemic stress of gut inflammation, and this interaction between external and internal stressors is modulated by the housing environment.

AB  - It has been previously shown that different extra-auditory alterations can be induced in animals exposed to noise at 15 days. However, data regarding exposure of younger animals, that do not have a functional auditory system, have not been obtained yet. Besides, the possibility to find a helpful strategy to restore these changes has not been explored so far. Therefore, the aims of the present work were to test age-related differences in diverse hippocampal-dependent behavioral measurements that might be affected in noise-exposed rats, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of a potential neuroprotective strategy, the enriched environment (EE), on noise-induced behavioral alterations. Male Wistar rats of 7 and 15 days were exposed to moderate levels of noise for two hours. At weaning, animals were separated and reared either in standard or in EE cages for one week. At 28 days of age, different hippocampal-dependent behavioral assessments were performed. Results show that rats exposed to noise at 7 and 15 days were differentially affected. Moreover, EE was effective in restoring all altered variables when animals were exposed at 7 days, while a few were restored in rats exposed at 15 days. The present findings suggest that noise exposure was capable to trigger significant hippocampal-related behavioral alterations that were differentially affected, depending on the age of exposure. In addition, it could be proposed that hearing structures did not seem to be necessarily involved in the generation of noise-induced hippocampal-related behaviors, as they were observed even in animals with an immature auditory pathway. Finally, it could be hypothesized that the differential restoration achieved by EE rearing might also depend on the degree of maturation at the time of exposure and the variable evaluated, being younger animals more susceptible to environmental manipulations.

AB  - Neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to be caused by a combination of adverse genetic and environmental insults. The "two-hit" hypothesis suggests that an early first "hit" primes the developing brain to be vulnerable to a second "hit" during adolescence which triggers behavioral dysfunction. We have previously modeled this scenario in mice and found that the combined effect of a genetic hapolinsuffuciency in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene (1st hit) and chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment during adolescence (2nd hit), caused spatial memory impairments in adulthood. Environmental enrichment (EE) protocols are designed to stimulate experience-dependent plasticity and have shown therapeutic actions. This study investigated whether EE can reverse these spatial memory impairments. Wild-type (WT) and BDNF heterozygous (HET) mice were treated with corticosterone (CORT) in their drinking water (50 mg/L) from weeks 6 to 8 and exposed to EE from 7 to 9 weeks. Enriched housing included open top cages with additional toys, tunnels, housing, and platforms. Y-maze novel preference testing, to assess short-term spatial memory, was performed at 10 weeks of age. At week 16 dorsal hippocampus tissue was obtained for Western blot analysis of expression levels of BDNF, the BDNF receptor TrkB, and NMDA receptor subunits, GluNR1, 2A and 2B. As in our previous studies, spatial memory was impaired in our two-hit (BDNF HET + CORT) mice. Simultaneous EE prevented these impairments. However, EE appeared to worsen spatial memory performance in WT mice, particularly those exposed to CORT. While BDNF levels were lower in BDNF HET mice as expected, there were no further effects of CORT or EE in males but a close to significant female CORT x EE x genotype interaction which qualitatively corresponded with Y-maze performance. However, EE caused both sex- and genotype-specific effects on phosphorylated TrkB residues and GluNR expression within the dorsal hippocampus, with GluNR2B levels in males changing in parallel with spatial memory performance. In conclusion, beneficial effects of EE on spatial memory emerge only following two developmental disruptions. The mechanisms by which EE exerts its effects are likely via regulation of multiple activity-dependent pathways, including TrkB and NMDA receptor signaling.

AB  - Chronic stress drives behavioral and physiological changes associated with numerous psychiatric disease states. In rodents, the vast majority of chronic stress models involve imposition of external stressors, whereas in humans stress is often driven by internal cues, commonly associated with a sense of loss. We previously exposed groups of rats to environmental enrichment (EE) for a protracted period (1 month), followed by removal of enrichment (ER), to induce an experience of loss in male rats. ER enhanced immobility in the forced swim test (FST), led to hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis hypoactivity, and caused hyperphagia relative to continuously enriched (EE), single-housed (Scon) and pair-housed (Pcon) groups, most of which were reversible by antidepressant treatment (Smith et al., 2017). Here, we have applied the same approach to study enrichment loss in female rats. Similar to the males, enrichment removal in females led to an increase in the time spent immobile in the FST and increased daytime food intake compared to the single and pair-housed controls. Unlike males, ER females showed decreased sucrose preference, and showed estrus cycle-dependent HPA axis hyperactivity to an acute restraint stress. The increase in passive coping (immobility), anhedonia-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and HPA axis dysregulation suggest that enrichment removal produces a loss phenotype in females that differs from that seen in males, which may be more pronounced in nature.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) mediates recovery from sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits and emotional abnormalities. In the present study, we examined the effects of EE on locomotor activity and neuronal activity in the amygdala in control and methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)-induced micrencephalic rats after challenge in a novel open field. Control rats housed in EE (CR) showed reduced locomotor activity compared to rats housed in a conventional cage (CC), whereas hyperactivity was seen in MAM rats housed in a conventional cage (MC) and in MAM rats housed in EE (MR). Novel open field exposure in both CC and MC resulted in a marked increase in Fos expression in the anterior and posterior parts of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, basomedial nucleus, and medial nucleus, whereas these increases in expression were not observed in CR. The effect of EE on Fos expression in the amygdala was different in MR exposed to a novel open field compared to CR. Furthermore, we observed a quite different pattern of Fos expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala between control and MAM rats. The present results suggest that neuronal activity in the amygdala that responds to anxiety is altered in MAM rats, especially when the rats are reared in EE. These alterations may cause behavioral differences between control and MAM rats.

AB  - Psycho-social stress has been suggested to influence the development of cancer, but it remains poorly defined with regard to pancreatic cancer, a lethal malignancy with few effective treatment modalities. In this study, we sought to investigate the impacts of enriched environment (EE) housing, a rodent model of "eustress'', on the growth of mouse pancreatic cancer, and to explore the potential underlying mechanisms through gene expression profiling. The EE mice showed significantly reduced tumor weights in both subcutaneous (53%) and orthotopic (41%) models, while each single component of EE (inanimate stimulation, social stimulation or physical exercise) was not profound enough to achieve comparative anti-tumor effects as EE. The integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed that in response to EE, a total of 129 genes in the tumors showed differential expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. The differentially expressed genes were mostly localized to the mitochondria and enriched in the citrate cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Interestingly, nearly all of the mitochondria-related genes were down-regulated by EE. Our data have provided experimental evidence in favor of the application of positive stress or of benign environmental stimulation in pancreatic cancer therapy.

AB  - The early postnatal period is a sensitive period in rodents as behavioural systems are developing and maturing during this time. However, relatively little information is available about the impact of environmental enrichment on offspring behaviour if enrichment is implemented only during this period. Here, environmental enrichment was provided from postnatal day 1 until weaning. On post-natal day 9, maternal behaviour and nonmaternal behaviour of the dam was observed. Nursing time in the enriched group was reduced but dams showed more non-maternal appetitive behaviours. Offspring were exposed to either the open field or the elevated plus maze (EPM) after weaning. In the open field, rats from the enriched group approached the more aversive inner zone of the open field later than control rats. Offspring from the enriched group made fewer entries into the inner zone and spent less time in this part of the arena. Enrichment had no impact on behaviour in the EPM. The present study provides evidence that postnatal enrichment can interfere with maternal behaviour in rats and can possibly lead to increased anxiety in the offspring. The findings suggest that enrichment procedures can have potentially unintended effects, interfering with the development of emotional behaviours in rats. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of environmental enrichment (EE) has grown in popularity over decades, particularly because EE is known to promote cognitive functions and well-being. Nonetheless, little is known about how EE may affect personality and gene expression. To address this question in a domestic animal, 10-month-old horses were maintained in a controlled environment or EE for 12 weeks. The control horses (n=9) lived in individual stalls on wood shaving bedding. They were turned out to individual paddocks three times a week and were fed three times a day with pellets or hay. EE-treated horses (n=10) were housed in large individual stalls on straw bedding 7 hours per day and spent the remainder of the time together at pasture. They were fed three times a day with flavored pellets, hay, or fruits and were exposed daily to various objects, odors, and music. The EE modified three dimensions of personality: fearfulness, reactivity to humans, and sensory sensitivity. Some of these changes persisted >3 months after treatment. These changes are suggestive of a more positive perception of the environment and a higher level of curiosity in EE-treated horses, explaining partly why these horses showed better learning performance in a Go/No-Go task. Reduced expression of stress indicators indicated that the EE also improved well-being. Finally, whole-blood transcriptomic analysis showed that in addition to an effect on the cortisol level, the EE induced the expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, while the control treatment activated genes related to apoptosis. Changes in both behavior and gene expression may constitute a psychobiological signature of the effects of enrichment and result in improved well-being. This study illustrates how the environment interacts with genetic information in shaping the individual at both the behavioral and molecular levels.

AB  - In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors play a role in the pathogenesis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study used Lister hooded rats (LHRs) as ADHD model animals to evaluate the effects of environmental factors. Male LHR pups were kept in four rearing conditions from postnatal day 23 (4 rats in a standard cage; 12 rats in a large flat cage; and 4 or 12 rats in an enriched environment [EE]) until 9 weeks of age. EE rearing but not rearing in a large flat cage decreased the activity of LHRs in the open field test that was conducted for 7 consecutive days. In the drop test, most rats reared in an EE remained on a disk at a height, whereas most rats reared in a standard cage fell off. RNA sequencing revealed that the immediate-early gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex of LHRs reared in an EE was reduced. cFos-expressing neurons were reduced in number in LHRs reared in an EE. These results suggest that growing in an EE improves ADHD-like behaviors and that said improvement is due to the suppression of neuronal activity in the mPFC.

AB  - Traditional monoaminergic treatments of depression frequently exhibit suboptimal tolerability and effectiveness. The 'short' (s) allele variant of 5-HTTLPR is known to compromise transcriptional efficacy of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and can reduce treatment response to traditional antidepressants (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs). This study sought to establish the 5-HTT knock-out (KO) line as a mouse model of SSRI-resistant depression and assess its response to a novel glutamatergic antidepressant, ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist. Following acute antidepressant treatment, 5-HTT KO mice and wild-type (WT) controls were subjected to the forced-swim test (FST), one of the most widely used techniques to detect acute antidepressant response. As hypothesised, when assessed 30 min after administration in the FST, the SSRI sertraline (20 mg/kg, i.p.) produced antidepressant-like effects in WT control but not in 5-HTT KO mice. In contrast, ketamine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) induced antidepressant-like effects in both genotypes. 5-HTT KO mice also exhibited a reduced locomotor response to both MK-801 (another NMDAR antagonist) and ketamine, and reduced GluN2A protein levels in the hippocampus, suggesting glutamatergic dysfunction in this model. These results highlight the utility of 5-HTT KO mice as a relevant model of SSRI-resistant depression and demonstrate that ketamine can produce acute antidepressant-like effects in conditions of 5-HTT deficiency. These findings extend existing literature that indicates ketamine is effective in ameliorating symptoms of treatment-resistant depression and may have implications for understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a progressive, prolonged course. Early prevention for SCZ is promising but overall lacks support from preclinical evidence. Previous studies have tested environmental enrichment (EE) in certain models of SCZ and discovered a broadly beneficial effect in preventing behavioral abnormalities relevant, yet not specific, to the disorder. Nonetheless, whether EE can prevent dopamine (DA) dysregulation, a hallmark of psychosis and SCZ, had not been tested.
   METHODS: Using the MAM (methylazoxymethanol acetate) rat model of schizophrenia and saline-treated control animals, we investigated the long-term electrophysiological effects of prepubertal (postnatal day 21-40) EE on DA neurons, pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus, and projection neurons in the basolateral amygdala. Anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus maze and locomotor responses to amphetamine were also analyzed.
   RESULTS: Prepubertal EE prevented the increased population activity of DA neurons and the associated increase in locomotor response to amphetamine. Prepubertal EE also prevented hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus but did not prevent hyperactivity in the basolateral amygdala. Anxiety-like behaviors in MAM rats were not ameliorated by prepubertal exposure to EE.
   CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-day prepubertal EE is sufficient to prevent DA hyperresponsivity in the MAM model, measured by electrophysiological recordings and locomotor response to amphetamine. This effect is potentially mediated by normalizing excessive firing in the ventral hippocampus without affecting anxiety-like behaviors and basolateral amygdala firing. This study identified EE as a useful preventative approach that may protect against the pathophysiological development of SCZ.

AB  - Neonatal (early) handling (EH) and environmental enrichment (EE) of laboratory rodents have been the two most commonly used methods of providing supplementary environmental stimulation in order to study behavioral and neurobiological plasticity. A large body of research has been generated since the 1950s, unequivocally showing that both treatments induce profound and long-lasting behavioral and neural consequences while also inducing plastic brain effects and being "protective" against some age-related deficits. The present work is aimed at reviewing the main neurobehavioral effects of both manipulations, with the final purpose of comparing them and trying to find out to what extent the effects of both treatments may share (or not) possible neural mechanisms.

AB  - Dogs are kenneled in professional facilities for a variety of reasons; however, the kennel environment, even for short periods, is a potential psychogenic stressor for most dogs. Continual stress and the resultant anxiety are undesirable for both ethical and physiological reasons. One growing area of research pertaining to the welfare of kenneled dogs is environmental enrichment, including auditory stimulation. The current study investigated the impact of music (classical, heavy metal, and specifically designed/altered classical) on activity level, vocalization, and body shaking of 117 kenneled dogs. Results suggest that classical music leads to kenneled dogs spending more time sleeping (F-8,F-354 = 12.24, P > 0.0001) and less time vocalizing (F-8,F-354 = 3.61, P > 0.0005) than when exposed to other music types or no music. Heavy metal music, compared with other music types, appears to increase body shaking (F-8,F-354 = 96.97, P > 0.0001), a behavior suggestive of nervousness. It is suggested that playing classical music in a shelter environment may help mitigate some of the stress inherent for many kenneled dogs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study analyzed ethanol intake in male and female Wistar rats exposed to maternal separation (MS) during infancy (postnatal days 1-21, PD1-21) and environmental enrichment (EE) during adolescence (PD 21-42). Previous work revealed that MS enhances ethanol consumption during adulthood. It is still unknown if a similar effect is found during adolescence. Several studies, in turn, have revealed that FE reverses stress experiences, and reduces ethanol consumption and reinforcement; although others reported greater ethanol intake after EE. The interactive effects between these treatments upon ethanol's effects and intake have yet to be explored. We assessed chronic ethanol intake and preference (12 two bottle daily sessions, spread across 30 days, 1st session on PD46) in rats exposed to MS and EE. The main finding was that male - but not female - rats that had been exposed to EE consumed more ethanol than controls given standard housing, an effect that was not affected by MS. Subsequent experiments assessed several factors associated with heightened ethanol consumption in males exposed to MS and EE; namely taste aversive conditioning and hypnotic-sedative consequences of ethanol. We also measured anxiety response in the light-dark box and in the elevated plus maze tests; and exploratory patterns of novel stimuli and behaviors indicative of risk assessment and risk-taking, via a modified version of the concentric square field (CSF) test. Aversive conditioning, hypnosis and sleep time were similar in males exposed or not to EE. EE males, however, exhibited heightened exploration of novel stimuli and greater risk taking behaviors in the CSF test. It is likely that the promoting effect of EE upon ethanol intake was due to these effects upon exploratory and risk-taking behaviors.

AB  - Millions of persons every year are affected by traumatic brain injury (TBI), and currently no therapies have shown efficacy in improving outcomes clinically. Recent research has suggested that enriched environments (EE), embryonic neural stem cells (eNSC), and progesterone (PROG) improve functional outcomes after TBI, and further, several investigators have suggested that a polytherapuetic approach may have greater efficacy than a single therapy. The purpose of the current study was to determine if varying combinations of post-injury EE, progesterone therapy, or eNSC transplantation would improve functional outcomes over just a single therapy. A controlled cortical impact was performed in rats to create a lesion in the medial frontal cortex. The rats were then placed in either EE or standard environments and administered 10mg/kg progesterone or vehicle injections 4h post-injury and every 12h for 72h after the initial injection. Seven days after the surgery, rats were transplanted with either eNSCs or media. Rats were then tested on the open field test, Barnes maze, Morris water maze, and Rotor-Rod tasks. Improved functional outcomes were shown on a majority of the behavioral tasks in animals that received a combination of therapies. This effect was especially prominent with therapies that were combined with EE. Immunohistochemistry showed that the transplanted eNSCs survived, migrated, and displayed neural phenotypes. These data suggest that a poly-therapeutic approach after TBI improves functional recovery to a greater magnitude. Moreover, when polytherapies are combined with EE, the effects on recovery are enhanced, leading to greater recovery of function.

AB  - Repetitive binge episodes favor transition to binge-eating disorders. Experimental evidence points to positive influence of environmental enrichment (EE) on drug/food addiction, although far less is known regarding EE effects over binge-like consumption. Here, we evaluate the following: (1) whether switching from nonenriched standard environment (SE) to EE housing conditions during adulthood alters a stable pattern of voluntary sucrose (10% w/v) binge-like intake in high (HD) vs. low (LD) drinking phenotypes under a drinking in the dark (DID) schedule; and (2) sucrose binge-like intake in a DID task in response to a pharmacological challenge with an OXr1 antagonist in HD/LD subpopulations after long-term exposure to SE or EE conditions. Adolescent (postnatal day 21; PND21) mice were housed in SE conditions. At PND65, all animals were long-term exposed to sucrose DID. On the first episode of DID (PND65), animals were divided into HD vs. LD subpopulations according to their sucrose intake. On PND85, an OXr1 antagonist test was conducted on HD and LD mice with SB-334867 (SB) administration. On PND95, HD and LD subpopulations were again randomly allocated into two subgroups, resulting in the following experimental conditions: HD-SE, HD-EE, LD-SE and LD-EE. Sucrose binge-like intake continued until PND116, when a second SB test was conducted. The main findings are: (1) a single 2 h episode of sucrose binge drinking in a DID procedure consistently segregates two behavioral subpopulations, HD and LD; (2) when adult mice in standard conditions and long-term exposed to sucrose DID were switched to EE conditions, an immediate reduction in sucrose binge-like intake was observed in HD mice, pointing to a therapeutic role of EE exposure; and (3) administration of the OXr1 antagonist caused an acute reduction in sucrose binge-like intake in HD and LD mice exposed to SE conditions. Importantly, exposure to EE conditions blunted the inhibitory effect of SB on sucrose binge consumption in both behavioral phenotypes, indirectly suggesting a potential EE/OXr1 signaling interaction. We propose the hypothesis that EE might regulate OX-dependent anxiety/compulsivity brain systems, which might secondarily modulate sucrose binge-like intake.

AB  - Early life experience can significantly determine later mental health status and cognitive function. Neonatal stress, in particular, has been linked to the etiology of mental health disorders as divergent as mood disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Our study uses a Balb/CByJ mouse model to test the hypothesis, that neonatal stress will alter development and subsequent environmental modulation of neocortex. Using a split litter design, we generated stressed mice (STR) and within litter controls (LMC) along with age-matched, untreated animals (AMC), to serve as across litter controls. Short, daily exposure to a psychosocial/physical stressor, during the first week of life, resulted by adulthood in significant changes in neocortical thickness and architecture, which were further modulated by exposure to behavioral testing. Surprisingly, cortical size in LMC mice was also affected. These observations were compared to the effects of environmental enrichment in the same mouse strain. Our data indicate that LMC and STR males share with environmentally enriched males, an increase in thickness in infra-granular cortical layers, while STR also display a stress selective decrease in supragranular layers, in response to behavioral training as adults.

AB  - Background: Animal welfare and accurate data collection are equally important in rodent research. Housing influences study outcomes and can challenge studies that monitor feeding, so housing choice needs to be evidence-based. The goal of these studies was to (1) compare established measures of well-being between rodents housed in wire grid-bottom floors with a resting platform compared to solid-bottom floors with bedding and (2) determine whether presence of a chewable device (Nylabone) affects orexin-A-induced hyperphagia.
   Methods: Rodents were crossed over to the alternate housing twice after 2-week periods. Time required to complete food intake measurements was recorded as an indicator of feasibility. Food intake stimulated by orexin-A was compared with and without the Nylabone. Blood corticosterone and hypothalamic BDNF were assessed.
   Results: Housing had no effect on growth, energy expenditure, corticosterone, hypothalamic BDNF, behavior, and anxiety measures. Food intake was disrupted after housing cross-over. Time required to complete food intake measurements was significantly higher for solid-bottom bedded cages. The Nylabone had no effect on orexin-A-stimulated feeding.
   Conclusion: Well-being is not significantly different between rodents housed on grid-bottom floors and those in solid-bottom-bedded cages based on overall growth and feeding but alternating between housing confounds measures of feeding.

AB  - De novo hippocampal neurogenesis contributes to functional recovery following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Enriched environment (EEN) can improve the outcome of TBI by positively affecting neurogenesis. Blast induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) characterized by memory impairment and increased anxiety levels, is a leading cause of chronic disability among soldiers. Using a rodent model of bTBI we asked: (a) whether long-term exposure to EEN after injury can ameliorate behavioral abnormalities and (b) what the effects of EEN are at the molecular and cellular levels and on de novo neurogenesis. We found that housing injured animals in EEN resulted in significantly improved spatial memory while animals in normal housing (NH) showed persistent memory impairment. VEGF and Tau protein but not Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were normalized in the dorsal hippocampus (DHC) of EEN rats while all three markers remained elevated in NH rats. Interestingly, after peaking at 6 weeks post-injury, anxiety returned to normal levels at 2 months independent of housing conditions. Housing animals in EEN had no significant effect on VEGF and Tau protein levels in the ventral hippocampus (VHC) and the amygdala (AD). We also found that EEN reduced IL-6 and IFN gamma levels in the VHC; these markers remained elevated following NH. We observed an increase in GFAP and DCX immunoreactivities in the VHC of NH animals at 2 months post-injury. Conversely, injured animals housed in EEN showed no increase in GFAP or DCX immunoreactivity in their VHC. In summary, long-term exposure of injured animals to EEN appears to play a positive role in the restoration of memory functions but not on anxiety, which returned to normal levels after a significant period of time. Cellular and molecular changes in response to EEN appear to be a part of neurogenesis-independent as well as dependent recovery processes triggered by bTBI.

AB  - Housing conditions are important determinants of animal behavior. Their impact on behavioral output depends on the behavior of interest, species, strain, and age of the animal evaluated. In the present study, male Swiss mice reared from weaning up to 8 weeks in social isolation (SI8), in enriched environment (EE8) or in standard environment (SE8) were evaluated in the elevated plus-maze (EPM), open-field (OFT) and tail-suspension (TST) tests. The effect of housing for 6 weeks in EE followed by 2 weeks in SI (EE6SI2) and the opposite condition (SI6EE2) was also studied. Housing conditions are reported to affect hippocampal neurogenesis; therefore, the expression of doublecortin (DCX) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG) of these mice was monitored. Data showed that SI8, EE8 and EE6SI2 reduced the stretching-attend postures in the EPM and explored more the center of the apparatus when compared to SE8. The time and the number of entries in the closed arms of the EPM was not affected indicating that effects of housing conditions in the EPM were not consequence of motor activity alteration. Accordingly, EE8 mice exploration of the OFT was similar to SE8. However, the SI8 mice explored the OFT more than the EE8 mice, suggesting hyperactivity induced by isolation. Behavior of Swiss mice in the TST was not altered, indicating that this test was not sensitive to the environmental changes in this mice strain. Compared to SE8, EE8 did not affect the number of DCX cells, whereas SI8, EE6SI2, and SI6EE2 decreased it. Taken together, our data suggest that the behavior of adult Swiss mice in the EPM and OFT was affected by environmental changes but that these changes seem to be independent of hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Environmental Enrichment has been shown in experimental contexts to have clear and often beneficial effects on animal physiology and behavior. Housing prior to experiments can represent a large proportion of an animal's living conditions, and improving housing conditions can be seen as "refinement" in a 3R-Context. However, large-dimensional implementation in rodent facilities often lack systematic analysis of respective refinement measures. Although enrichment is a legally binding element for housing animals according to EU law, potential effects on data variability are often neglected or not taken in consideration for experimental designs.
   Here, we aimed at implementing a new and innovative tool to improve wellbeing without side effects applicable for male and female mice. This poses a great challenge since the social structure in this species allows group housing in females without the risk of aggressive interaction, while in males despotic dominance hierarchy is often associated with agonistic interactions. Thus, we focused on enrichment-induced changes in behavior and stress physiology emphasizing effects on data variability in both sexes.
   Accordingly, recycled cage lids (resembling sex-neutral early environmental experiences in mice) were formed and three shapes of different structures were examined ('Cage Climber'): 'Triangle Climber', 'Bridge Climber' and 'Round Arch Climber'.
   The results demonstrate significant preferences of C57BL/6 N mice for any of the three structures in comparison with a neutral object when presented in a Novel Object Test. Despite intense use of enrichment, there were neither behavioral alterations detectable in a test battery assessing locomotion, anxiety and sociability nor in assessment of stress physiological parameters such as stress hormone metabolites, analyzed non-invasively from feces.
   Additionally, the structural supplement did not affect general variability of data in both male and female mice.
   To promote well-being of mice in a 3R-matched context, our study recommends the use of properly assessed structural enrichment, such as 'Cage Climbers' combined with nesting material to satisfy physical and thermal needs in the cage environment.

AB  - Stress-related psychiatric disorders including depression involve complex cellular and molecular changes in the brain, and GABAergic signaling dysfunction is increasingly implicated in the etiology of mood disorders. Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons are fast-spiking interneurons that, among other roles, coordinate synchronous neuronal firing. Mounting evidence suggests that the PV neuron phenotype is altered by stress and in mood disorders. In this systematic review, we assessed PV interneuron alterations in psychiatric disorders as reported in human postmortem brain studies and animal models of environmental stress. This review aims to 1) comprehensively catalog evidence of PV cell function in mood disorders (humans) and stress models of mood disorders (animals); 2) analyze the strength of evidence of PV interneuron alterations in various brain regions in humans and rodents; 3) determine whether the modulating effect of antidepressant treatment, physical exercise, and environmental enrichment on stress in animals associates with particular effects on PV function; and 4) use this information to guide future research avenues. Its principal findings, derived mainly from rodent studies, are that stress-related changes in PV cells are only reported in a minority of studies, that positive findings are region-, age-, sex-, and stress recency-dependent, and that antidepressants protect from stress-induced apparent PV cell loss. These observations do not currently translate well to humans, although the postmortem literature on the topic remains limited.

AB  - The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus, Illiger, 1815, Canidae) is a threatened species that inhabits the cerrados of Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Captive maned wolves could be potentially used in reintroduction programs for species conservation; however, it is necessary that their behavior and cognitive abilities are conserved. Environmental enrichment is a tool used to stimulate captive animals and maintain a natural behavioral repertoire. To compare the variation of captive maned wolves' behavioral responses to environmental enrichment, we studied three maned wolves held by Belo Horizonte Zoo, Brazil. Foraging, interspecific, and intraspecific stimuli were offered to the animals and their responses were compared with a baseline and postenrichment treatments. The test was used to help in choosing which one of the three individuals would participate in a reintroduction project. The results showed that stimuli type did influence the animal's responses, and that individually wolves responded differently to foraging, interspecific, and intraspecific enrichment items (P80.05 for some behaviors in each enrichment category). The individual's personality seemed to influence their behavioral responses, with animals showing bold and shy responses, and this trait should be considered during decision makings for reintroduction.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) refers to the provision of a complex and stimulating housing condition which improves well-being, behaviour and brain function of laboratory animals. The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects of EE are only partially understood. In the current report, we describe a link between EE and neuropeptide Y (NPY), based on findings from NPY knockout (KO) mice exposed to EE. Relative to EE-housed wildtype (WT) animals, NPY KO mice displayed altered behaviour as well as molecular and morphological changes in amygdala and hippocampus. Exposure of WT mice to EE reduced anxiety and decreased central glucocorticoid receptor expression, effects which were absent in NPY KO mice. In addition, NPY deletion altered the preference of EE items, and EE-housed NPY KO mice responded to stress with exaggerated hyperthermia, displayed impaired spatial memory, had higher hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels and altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity, effects which were not seen in WT mice. Accordingly, these findings suggest that NPY contributes to the anxiolytic effect of EE and that NPY deletion reverses the beneficial effects of EE into a negative experience. The NPY system could thus be a target for "enviromimetics", therapeutics which reproduce the beneficial effects of enhanced environmental stimulation.

AB  - Stress exposure can produce profound changes in physiology and behavior that can impair health and well- being. Of note, stress exposure is linked to anxiety disorders and depression in humans. The widespread impact of these disorders warrants investigation into treatments to mitigate the harmful effects of stress. Pharmacological treatments fail to help many with these disorders, so recent work has focused on non-pharmacological alternatives. One of the most promising of these alternatives is environmental enrichment (EE). In rodents, EE includes social, physical, and cognitive stimulation for the animal, in the form of larger cages, running wheels, and toys. EE successfully reduces the maladaptive effects of various stressors, both as treatment and prophylaxis. While we know that EE can have beneficial effects under stress conditions, the morphological and molecular mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects are still not well understood. EE is known to alter neurogenesis, dendrite development, and expression of neurotrophic growth factors, effects that vary by type of enrichment, age, and sex. To add to this complexity, EE has differential effects in different brain regions. Understanding how EE exerts its protective effects on morphological and molecular levels could hold the key to developing more targeted pharmacological treatments. In this review, we summarize the literature on the morphological and molecular consequences of EE and stress in key emotional regulatory pathways in the brain, the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The similarities and differences among these regions provide some insight into stress-EE interaction that may be exploited in future efforts toward prevention of, and intervention in, stress-related diseases.

AB  - Animals perceiving repeated aversive events can become chronically stressed. Chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can have deleterious consequences on physiological parameters (e.g. BW, blood chemistry) and behaviour (e.g. emotional reactivity, stereotypies, cognition). Environmental enrichment (EE) can be a mean to reduce animal stress and to improve welfare. The aim of this study was first, to assess the effects of EE in battery cages on the behaviour of young Japanese quail and second, to evaluate the impact of EE on quail exposed to chronic stress. The experiment involved quail housed in EE cages and submitted or not to a chronic stress procedure (CSP) (EE cages, control quail: n = 16, CSP quail: n = 14) and quail housed in standard cages and exposed or not to the CSP (standard non-EE cages, control quail: n = 12, CSP quail: n = 16). Our procedure consisted of repeated aversive events (e.g. ventilators, delaying access to food, physical restraint, noise) presented two to five times per 24 h, randomly, for 15 days. During CSP, EE improved quail's welfare as their stereotypic pacing decreased and they rested more. CSP decreased exploration in all quail. After the end of CSP, quail presented increased emotional reactivity in emergence test. However, the effect of EE varied with test. Finally, chronic stress effects on comfort behaviours in the emergence test were alleviated by EE. These results indicate that EE can alleviate some aspects of behavioural alterations induced by CSP.

AB  - Environmental factors such as stress drive the development of drug addiction in genetically vulnerable individuals; the genes underlying this vulnerability are unknown. One strategy for uncovering these genes is to study the impact of environmental manipulation on high-throughput phenotypes that predict drug use and addiction-like behaviors. In the present study, we assessed the viability of this approach by evaluating the relative effects of environmental enrichment and isolation housing on three high-throughput phenotypes known to predict variation on distinct aspects of intravenous drug self-administration. Prior to behavioral testing, male and female C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (BXD founders) were housed in enrichment or isolation for ten weeks beginning at weaning. Enrichment significantly reduced novelty reactivity; this effect was significantly more robust in C57BL/6J mice relative to DBA/2J mice. Enrichment significantly reduced novelty preference; this effect was significantly dependent on novel environment characteristics and was significantly more robust in DBA/2J mice relative to C57BL/6J mice. Enrichment significantly increased anxiety; this effect was not strain-dependent. Collectively, these data indicate that (1) environmental enrichment influences novelty reactivity, novelty preference, and anxiety via distinct genetic mechanisms in mice, and (2) the BXD panel can be used to discover the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

AB  - The impact of environmental factors on immune responses may be influenced by coping characteristics of the individuals under study. The behavioral response of pigs in a so-called Backrest early in life seems indicative of their coping style at a later age. The present study investigated the effects of housing, barren versus enriched, and coping style, as assessed by Backtest classification, on immune responses of pigs. Pigs were housed either without a rooting substrate (barren housing) or in identical pens enriched with deep straw bedding (enriched housing) from birth. During the suckling period, pigs were subjected to the Backtest. Each pig was restrained on its back for 1 min and the resistance (i.e., number of escape attempts) was scored. Pigs classified as 'high-' or 'low-resisting' (HR and LR, respectively) were immunized with di-nitrophenyl-conjugated keyhole limpet haemocyanin (DNP-KLH) at 9 weeks of age. Blood samples were drawn before immunization (Day 0) and weekly thereafter, until Day 35. KLH-specific lymphocyte proliferation following immunization was higher for HR pigs than for LR pigs. Housing did not affect proliferative responses. Housing and coping style interacted in their effect on KLH-specific humoral immune responses. LR pigs from barren housing showed higher KLH-specific antibody titers than LR pigs from enriched housing. Differently housed HR pigs, however, showed similar antibody titers. These findings support other research indicating that individual coping styles of pigs are reflected in their immune responses. More important, the present study demonstrates that effects of housing on humoral immune responses of pigs may differ for pigs with divergent coping styles.

AB  - Background: The startle response is considered as the major physio-behavioral indication of anxiety in health and disease conditions. However, due to different protocols of stimulation and measurement, the magnitude as well as the appearance of the startle response is inconsistent.
   New method: We postulate that the startle probability and not merely the amplitude may bare information that will form a consistent physiological measure of anxiety.
   Results: To examine the proof-of-concept of our suggested probability model, we evaluated the effects of acute (single) versus chronic (14 days) MPH administration on both startle amplitude and probability. We found that both acute and chronic MPH administration has yielded similar effects on startle amplitude. However, acute MPH increased the startle's probability while chronic MPH decreased it. Next, we evaluated the effects of acute versus chronic stress on the startle's parameters and found a complementary effect. Explicitly, acute stress increased the startle's probability while chronic stress increased the startle amplitude. In contrast, enriched environment had no significant effects. Finally, to further validate the probability measure, we show that Midazolam had significant anxiolytic effects.
   In the second part, we investigated the acoustic startle response parameters (e.g. background noise and pulse duration), to better understand the interplay between these parameters and the startle amplitude versus probability.
   Conclusions: We show that the probabilistic element of the startle response does not only point to deeper physiologic relationships but may also serve as "hidden variables" congruent but not entirely identical to the commonly researched amplitude of the startle response.

AB  - It was shown in a recent study [7] that barren housed pigs (small pens, no substrate) have a blunted circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol as compared to enriched housed pigs (large pens with daily fresh bedding). In the light period, enriched housed pigs showed significantly higher concentrations of cortisol in saliva than barren housed pigs, whereas in the dark period, cortisol concentrations were low in both enriched and barren housed pigs. In the present study, the immunological consequences of the difference in baseline salivary cortisol concentration in the light period were evaluated. It appeared that leukocyte and lymphocyte distributions, and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation following ConcanavalineA (ConA) stimulation in the assay using purified lymphocytes were not affected. However, barren and enriched housed pigs did show a different proliferation response to ConA in the whole blood assay. At day 2 of culture, proliferation was higher in barren housed pigs than in enriched housed pigs, whereas at day 4 of culture, proliferation was higher in enriched housed pigs than in barren housed pigs. Lymphocyte proliferation at day 2 of culture in the whole blood assay correlated negatively with plasma cortisol levels, which might thus explain the higher proliferation in barren housed pigs at day 2 of culture. The in vivo humoral and cellular (delayed type hypersensitivity, DTH) immune response to KLH was not affected by housing conditions. We conclude that, although baseline salivary cortisol concentrations differ between enriched and barren housed pigs, immune function appears to be relatively unaffected.

AB  - The kynurenine (KYN) pathway of tryptophan (TRP) degradation is activated by stress and inflammatory factors. It is now well established that social stress induces the activation of the immune system, with central inflammation and KYN metabolism being two of the main factors linking stress with depression. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-lasting changes in the KYN pathway induced by social defeat (SD) associated with the resilience or susceptibility to an increase in the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine. Mice were exposed to repeated SD and 3 weeks later, a conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by a subthreshold dose of cocaine (1.5 mg/kg) was developed. KYN levels in plasma, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum and limbic forebrain were studied at the end of the CPP procedure. Changes in the KYN pathway after exposure to pharmacological (oxytocin and indomethacin) and environmental interventions (environmental enrichment) were also evaluated. Our results showed that defeated susceptible (SD-S) mice had higher conditioning scores than resilient mice (SD-R). In addition, although KYN concentration was elevated in all defeated mice, SD-R mice showed smaller increases in KYN concentration in the cerebellum than SD-S mice. Oxytocin or Indomethacin treatment before SD normalized cocaine-induced CPP, although the increase in the KYN pathway was maintained. However, environmental enrichment before SD normalized cocaine-induced CPP and prevented the increase in the KYN pathway. The present study highlights the role of the KYN pathway and anti-inflammatory drugs acting on TRP metabolism as pharmacological targets to potentiate resilience to social stress effects.

AB  - Individual animal personalities interact with environmental conditions to generate differences in behavior, a phenomenon of growing interest for understanding the effects of environmental enrichment on captive animals. Wheels are common environmental enrichment for laboratory rodents, but studies conflict on how this influences behavior, and interaction of wheels with individual personalities has rarely been examined. We examined whether wheel access altered personality profiles in adult Siberian dwarf hamsters. We assayed animals in a tunnel maze twice for baseline personality, then again at two and at seven weeks after the experimental group was provisioned with wheels in their home cages. Linear mixed model selection was used to assess changes in behavior over time and across environmental gradient of wheel exposure. While animals showed consistent inter-individual differences in activity, activity personality did not change upon exposure to a wheel. Boldness also varies among individuals, and there is evidence for female boldness scores converging after wheel exposure, that is, opposite shifts in behavior by high and low boldness individuals, although sample size is too small for the mixed model results to be robust. In general, Siberian dwarf hamsters appear to show low behavioral plasticity, particularly in general activity, in response to running wheels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous research has indicated that rearing in an enriched environment may promote self-control in an impulsive choice task. To further assess the effects of rearing environment on impulsivity, 2 experiments examined locomotor activity, impulsive action, impulsive choice, and different aspects of reward sensitivity and discrimination. In Experiment 1, rats reared in isolated or enriched conditions were tested on an impulsive choice procedure with a smaller-sooner versus a larger-later reward, revealing that the isolated rats valued the smaller-sooner reward more than the enriched rats. A subsequent reward challenge was presented in which the delay to the 2 rewards was the same but the magnitude difference remained. The enriched rats did not choose the larger reward as often as the isolated rats, reflecting poorer reward discrimination. Impulsive action was assessed using a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate task, which revealed deficits in the enriched rats. In Experiment 2, rats reared in isolated, standard, or enriched conditions were tested on reward contrast and reward magnitude sensitivity procedures. The rats were presented with 2 levers that delivered different magnitudes of food on variable interval 30-s schedules. Across all tests, the enriched and social rats displayed more generalized responding to the small-reward lever, but a similar response to the large-reward lever, compared with the isolated rats. This confirmed the results of Experiment 1, indicating poorer reward discrimination in the enriched condition compared with the isolated condition. The results suggest that enrichment may moderate reward generalization/discrimination processes through alterations in incentive motivational processes.

AB  - Enriched environmental (EE) housing dampens stress-induced alterations in neurobiological systems, promotes adaptability, and extinguishes submissive behavioral traits developed during social defeat stress (SD). In the present study, we hypothesized that enrichment before SD can confer stress resiliency and, furthermore, that neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is requisite for this resiliency. To test these hypotheses, mice were housed in EE, standard (SE), or impoverished (IE) housing and then exposed to SD. EE conferred resilience to SD as measured in several behavioral tasks. EE-housed mice expressed elevated FosB/Delta FosB immunostaining in areas associated with emotional regulation and reward processing, i.e., infralimbic, prelimbic, and anterior cingulate cortices, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, and this expression was mostly preserved in mice receiving EE followed by SD. In contrast, in SE-or IE-housed animals, SD increased maladaptive behaviors and greatly reduced FosB/Delta FosB staining in the forebrain. We tested the putative involvement of the PFC in mediating resilience by lesioning individual regions of the PFC either before or after EE housing and then exposing the mice to SD. We found that discrete lesions of the infralimbic but not prelimbic or cingulate cortex made before but not after EE abolished the behavioral resiliency to stress afforded by EE and attenuated FosB/Delta FosB expression in the accumbens and amygdala while increasing it in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. These data suggest that pathological ventromedial PFC outputs to downstream limbic targets could predispose an individual to anxiety disorders in stressful situations, whereas enhanced ventromedial PFC outputs could convey stress resilience.

AB  - Free-range use by broiler chickens is often limited, whereas better use of the free-range area could benefit animal welfare. Use of free-range areas could be stimulated by more appropriate shelter or environmental enrichment (by decreasing birds' fearfulness). This study aimed to assess the effects of shelter type, early environmental enrichment and weather conditions on free-range use. Three production rounds with 440 slow-growing broiler chickens (Sasso T451) were carried out. Birds were housed indoors in four groups (two with males, two with females) from days 0 to 25, during which two of the groups received environmental enrichment. At day 23 birds' fearfulness was assessed with a tonic immobility (TI) test (n=100). At day 25 all birds were moved (in mixed-sex groups) to mobile houses, and provided with free-range access from day 28 onwards. Each group could access a range consisting for 50% of grassland with 21 artificial shelters (ASs, wooden A-frames) and for 50% of short rotation coppice (SRC) with willow (dense vegetation). Free-range use was recorded by live observations at 0900, 1300 and 1700 h for 15 to 21 days between days 28 and 63. For each bird observed outside the shelter type (AS or SRC), distance from the house (0 to 2, 2 to 5, >5 m) and its behaviour (only rounds 2 and 3) were recorded. Weather conditions were recorded by four weather stations. On average, 27.1% of the birds were observed outside at any given moment of observation. Early environmental enrichment did not decrease fearfulness as measured by the TI test. It only had a minor effect on the percentage of birds outside (0.4% more birds outside). At all distances from the house, SRC was preferred over AS. In AS, areas closer to the house were preferred over farther ones, in SRC this was less pronounced. Free-range use increased with age and temperature and decreased with wind speed. In AS, rainfall and decreasing solar radiation were related to finding more birds outside, whereas the opposite was true in SRC. Behaviour of the birds depended on shelter type, distance from the house, early environmental enrichment, time of day and age. Chickens ranged more and farther in SRC, possibly because this provided a greater sense of safety because of the amount of cover and/or better protection against adverse weather conditions. These results indicate that SRC with willow is a more appropriate shelter for slow-growing broiler chickens than A-frames.

AB  - Reduced promoter IV-driven expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in stress and major depression. We previously reported that defective promoter IV (KIV) caused depression-like behavior in young adult mice, which was reversed more effectively by enriched environment treatment (EET) than antidepressants. The effects of promoter IV-BDNF deficiency and EET over the life stages remain unknown. Since early-life development (ED) involves dynamic epigenetic processes, we hypothesized that EET during ED would provide maximum antidepressive effects that would persist later in life due to enhanced, long-lasting BDNF induction. We tested this hypothesis by determining EET effects across three life stages: ED (0-2 months), young adult (2-4 months), and old adult (12-14 months). KIV mice at all life stages showed depression-like behavior in the open-field and tail-suspension tests compared with wild-type mice. Two months of EET reduced depression-like behavior in ED and young adult, but not old adult mice, with the largest effect in ED KIV mice. This effect lasted for 1 month after discontinuance of EET only in ED mice. BDNF protein induction by EET in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was also the largest in ED mice and persisted only in the hippocampus of ED KIV mice after discontinuance of EET. No gender-specific effects were observed. The results suggest that defective promoter IV causes depression-like behavior, regardless of age and gender, and that EET during ED is particularly beneficial to individuals with promoter IV-BDNF deficiency, while additional treatment may be needed for older adults.

AB  - Chronic exposure to stress disturbs the homeostasis of the brain, thus, deleteriously affecting the neurological circuits. In literature, there are investigations about the stress-related alterations in behavioral response and adult neurogenesis; however, an effective combating strategy to evade stress is still at stake. Hence, the present study is designed to investigate the effect of an enriched environment in alleviating the anxiety/depressive-like behavioral response and enhancing the adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal region of rats exposed to chronic immobilization stress. The rats were exposed to chronic immobilization stress (IS) for 4 h/day followed by the enriched environment (EE) for 2 h/day for 28 days, and finally, the hippocampal region was dissected out after the behavioral analyses. IS group showed increased behavioral despair to tail suspension test, decrement in the activity for light/dark box test, and less grooming activity towards splash test. In contrast, IS + EE rats exhibited a decrease in the activity of tail suspension test and an increase in the behavioral response to light/dark box test and splash test. The in vitro assessment of primary cultures of neurospheres from the IS group resulted in decreased levels of proliferation in the cell number and metabolic activity of both MTT assay and lactate levels. IS + EE group revealed an increase in the growth curve of neurospheres and higher metabolic activities of MTT and lactate. The IS cultures had reduced neurite length, while the neurite outgrowths were increased in IS + EE group. The IS group showed significant reduction in the protein and mRNA levels of nestin, GFAP, CD11b, MOG, and synaptophysin, whereas the IS + EE cultures exhibited significant increase in the levels of these stem cell markers. Our data highlight the positive impact of EE against stress-related behavioral changes in rats exposed to chronic immobilization stress perhaps by interfering with the differentiation of neurospheres and neurogenesis.

AB  - Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have led to lasting deficits for an estimated 5.3 million American patients. Effective therapies for these patients remain scarce and each of the clinical trials stemming from success in experimental models has failed. We believe that the failures may be, in part, due to the lack of preclinical assessment of cognitive domains that widely affect clinical TBI. Specifically, the behavioral tasks in the TBI literature often do not focus on common executive impairments related to the frontal lobe such as cognitive flexibility. In previous work, we have demonstrated that the attentional set-shifting test (AST), a task analogous to the clinically-employed Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), could be used to identify cognitive flexibility impairments following controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. In this study, we hypothesized that both the administration of the antidepressant drug citalopram (CIT) and exposure to a preclinical model of neurorehabilitation, environmental enrichment (EE), would attenuate cognitive performance deficits on AST when provided alone and lead to greater benefits when administered in combination. Adult male rats were subjected to a moderate-severe CCI or sham injury. Rats were randomly divided into experimental groups that included surgical injury, drug therapy, and housing condition. We observed that both CIT and EE provided significant cognitive recovery when administered alone and reversal learning performance recovery increased the most when the therapies were combined (p < 0.05). Ongoing studies continue to evaluate novel ways of assessing more clinically relevant measurements of high order cognitive TBI-related impairments in the rat model.

AB  - To study how motivational factors modulate experience-dependent neurobehavioral plasticity, we modify a protocol of environmental enrichment (EE) in rats. We assumed that the benefits derived from EE might vary according to the level of incentive salience attributed to it. To enhance the rewarding properties of EE, access to the EE cage varied randomly from 2 to 48 h for 30 days (REE). The REE group was enriched only 50% of the time and was compared to standard housing and continuous EE (CEE) groups. As behavioral readout, we analyzed the spontaneous activity and the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) within the EE cage weekly, and in the open field test at the end of the experiment. In the cage, REE increased the utilization of materials, physical activity, and the rate of appetitive USVs. In the OF, the CEE-induced enhancements in novelty habituation and social signaling were equaled by the REE. At the neural level, we measured the expression of genes related to neural plasticity and epigenetic regulations in different brain regions. In the dorsal striatum and hippocampus, REE upregulated the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, its tropomyosin kinase B receptor, and the DNA methyltransferase 3A. Altogether, our results suggest that the higher activity within the cage and the augmented incentive motivation provoked by the REE boosted its neurobehavioral effects equaling or surpassing those observed in the CEE condition. As constant exposures to treatments or stimulating environments are virtually impossible for humans, restricted EE protocols would have greater translational value than traditional ones.

However, how BDNF deficiency and EET affect the neurotransmitter gene expression differently across ages remains unclear. We addressed this question by determining the neurotransmitter gene expression across three life stages in wild-type and activity-dependent BDNF-deficient (KIV) mice. Mice received 2-months of standard control treatment (SCT) or EET at early-life development (ED: 0-2 months), young adulthood (2-4 months), and old adulthood (12-14 months) (N = 16/group). Half of these mice received additional 1-month SCT to examine persisting EET effects. High-throughput quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction measured expression of 81 genes for dopamine, adrenaline, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid, glutamate, acetylcholine, and BDNF systems in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus. Results revealed that BDNF deficiency mostly reduced neurotransmitter gene expression, greatest at ED in the FC. EET increased expression of a larger number of genes at ED than adulthood, particularly in the KIV FC. Many genes down-regulated in KIV mice were up-regulated by EET, which persisted when EET was provided at ED (e.g., 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) transporter [5HTT], ADRA1D, GRIA3, GABRA5, GABBR2). In both the regions, BDNF deficiency decreased the density of gene co-expression network specifically at ED, while EET increased the density and hub genes (e.g., GAT1, GABRG3, GRIN1, CHRNA7). These results suggest that BDNF deficiency, which occurs under chronic stress, causes neurotransmitter dysregulations prominently at ED, particularly in the FC. EET at ED may be most effective to normalize the dysregulations, providing persisting effects later in life.

AB  - Lactating mice in laboratory conditions are thought to be under considerable stress. Dams may manifest this stress through a decrease in milk yield and/or increase in infanticide. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of access to an environmental enrichment device called the RatLoft on milk yield, circulating serotonin, and pup mortality using both wild-type mice and mice genetically deficient in tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1(-/-); the rate-limiting enzyme in the non-neuronal serotonin synthesis pathway). Presence or absence of the RatLoft did not affect milk yield or circulating serotonin concentrations overall, but serotonin concentrations decreased throughout the 21-day lactation period. Serotonin concentrations were increased in TPH1-deficient mice with access to the RatLoft compared with those without the RatLoft on day 21. Pup mortality tended to decrease for dams with access to the RatLoft as compared to no RatLoft. Within the TPH1(-/-) groups, dams with access to the RatLoft tended to kill less pups per dam than dams without the RatLoft. These results demonstrate that access to the RatLoft during lactation decreases pup infanticide by dams. This environmental enrichment may be particularly beneficial to TPH1(-/-) dams that, in addition to decreased infanticide, had increased serotonin concentrations, possibly indicating enhanced well-being. Use of the RatLoft could prove beneficial to researchers working with lactating mouse models to increase the number of pups weaned and positively impact the welfare of the dam.

AB  - A wide agreement exists that environmental enrichment (EE) is most beneficial if introduced early in life, but numerous studies reported that also aged animals remain responsive. As age-related memory and cognition impairments are not uniform, an open question is whether EE might exert different effects in animals with different age-related deficits. A 12-week EE protocol was applied to late adult rats pretested for habituation and aversive memory Animals were classified as low (LP) and high (HP) performers according to percent exploration change in Open Field test (OF) and as impaired (I) and not impaired (NI) according to latency in Step-through Passive Avoidance test (PA). Standard housing (SH) animals pretested by OF and PA, and naive (non-pretested) EE and SH rats were used as controls. In comparison to pretest, after the housing protocol, EE LP ameliorated while EE HP and both SH HP and LP worsened their habituation pattern. The positive influence of EE on LP was probably due to the more active interaction with and the faster adaptation to surroundings promoted by continuous, multiple stimuli provided during the enriched housing. Regarding HP, EE did not boost the basal behavior, which likely represented the maximum achievable for that age, and the post housing exploration change dropped, as in SH animals, because of the retesting. After EE, a significant percentage of NI animals became I and a significant percentage of I animals became NI. The changes evidenced in the NI group likely depended on EE related reduction of anxiety and the consequent more efficient coping with fearful situations. This hypothesis was strengthened by the observation that naive EE animals were almost all I. Pretested EE I rats were not influenced by the rearing condition: their behavior was comparable to SH animals' behavior and determined by retesting. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that, when applied to aging rats, EE produces different effects based on pre-housing cognitive performances. The issue needs further analyses, but the observation that not all animals are able to take advantage of EE to the same extent suggests the opportunity to design individually tailored approaches to optimize their efficacy and minimize possible unwanted consequences.

AB  - Psychosocial stress-particularly in combination with genetic vulnerability-is a critical environmental risk factor for psychiatric diseases in humans. Isolation rearing (IR) and social defeat (SD) paradigms model psychosocial risk factors in rodents, while enriched environment (EE) protects them from behavioural deficits. Studying the influence of various environmental conditions, e.g., on genetic mouse models can help to dissect the complex gene-environment relationships underlying human psychiatric diseases. Such studies may require analysing multiple mouse cohorts; however, the comparability of behavioural experiments is challenging and often compromised by practical limitations such as group sizes and influences of handling. Therefore, protocol standardization as well as appropriate statistical normalization is necessary to compare different experiments. In this study, we analysed two independent cohorts to compare the behavioural profiles of wild-type male mice subjected to IR and SD. In both cases, EE conditions served as a reference. Multivariate statistics was applied to merge the data from individual measures into broader categories (such as curiosity, anxiety and fear memory) by estimating their calibrated joint effect within a category. Plotting and overlaying these calibrated effect sizes in a single graph allowed intuitive comparison of IR and SD behavioural profiles. This approach allows analysing multiple behavioural tests at once, which is more relevant to psychiatric syndromes than focusing on single behavioural measures. Our method revealed that motivation and fear memory are impaired by both conditions, whereas ambulation and pain sensitivity are affected only by IR and curiosity is mainly diminished upon SD. Thus, IR could be a paradigm of choice in studies focusing on positive symptoms, while SD might be more relevant for negative and cognitive symptoms.

AB  - Developmental life experience has long-lasting influences on the brain and behavior. The present study aims to examine the long-term effects of the enriched environment (EE), which was imposed during the adolescence period of life, on their passive avoidance and recognition memories as well as anxiety-like behaviors and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, in sleep-deprived male rats. In the present study, the male pups were separated from their mothers in postnatal day 21 (PND21) and were housed in the standard or EE for 40 days. In PND 61, the rats were allocated in four groups: control, SD (sleep deprivation), EE, and EE + SD groups. SD was induced in rats by a modified multiple platform model for 24 h. Open field, novel object recognition memory, and passive avoidance memory tests were used to examine behavior and cognitive ability. The expression of hippocampal BDNF levels was determined by PCR. The results revealed that SD increased anxiety-like behaviors and impaired cognitive ability, while adolescent EE housing alleviated these changes. In addition, EE reversed SD-induced changes in hippocampal BDNF level. We also demonstrated that EE not only has beneficial effects on the cognitive functions of normal rats but also declined memory deficits induced by SD. In conclusion, our results suggest that housing in EE during the adolescence period of life reduces cognitive impairment induced by SD. The increase of the BDNF level in the hippocampus is a possible mechanism to alleviate cognitive performance in sleep-deprived rats.

AB  - Improving the quality of life of captive animals is dependent on developing valid measures of how animals feel about their lives. It has recently been suggested that biases in information processing may offer a novel means of understanding animal emotions. Anxious and depressed people tend to interpret ambiguous information negatively. We explored the proposal that such cognitive biases also exist in non-human animals and could therefore be used as novel measures of animal welfare. We used a novel cognitive bias task based on a learnt taste aversion to determine whether birds deprived of environmental enrichment show biases in their classification of ambiguous signals. We hypothesised that starlings in enriched cages should be more likely to classify ambiguous signals as being associated with a positive outcome than starlings housed in standard, unenriched cages. Starlings were trained on a go/no-go procedure to discriminate between two visual stimuli (cardboard lids of white and dark grey) associated with outcomes of a different value (palatable and unpalatable mealworms hidden underneath). Individual birds' responses to unreinforced, intermediate stimuli (various shades of grey between white and dark grey) were subsequently examined while each bird was housed sequentially in both standard and enriched cages. The probability of a bird classifying an ambiguous pale grey lid as hiding a palatable mealworm was lower in standard cages than enriched cages, but this difference was found only in birds that received enriched cages first. Our results can be interpreted as showing a pessimistic bias in birds that have recently experienced a decline in environmental quality. These findings support the use of cognitive bias-based tasks as a novel, non-invasive technique for assessing welfare in non-human animals.

AB  - The use of more ethological animal models to study the neurobiology of anxiety has increased in recent years. We assessed the effect of an environmental enrichment (EE) protocol (24 h/day over a period of two months) on anxiety-related behaviors when aged Wistar rats (21 months old) were confronted with cat odor stimuli. Owing to the relationship between GABAergic interneurons and the anxiety-related neuronal network, we examined changes in the expression of Parvalbumin (PV) and 67 kDa form of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-67) immunoreactive cells in different brain regions involved in stress response. Behavioral results revealed that enriched rats traveled further and made more grooming behaviors during the habituation session. In the cat odor session, they traveled longer distances and they showed more active interaction with the odor stimuli and less time in freezing behavior. Zone analysis revealed that the enriched group spent more time in the intermediate zone according to the proximity of the predator odor. Regarding the neurobiological data, the EE increased the expression of PV-positive cells in some medial prefrontal regions (cingulate (Cg) and prelimbic (PL) cortices), whereas the GAD-67 expression in the basolateral amygdala was reduced in the enriched group. Our results suggest that EE is able to reduce anxiety-like behaviors in aged animals even when ethologically relevant stimuli are used. Moreover, GABAergic interneurons could be involved in mediating this resilient behavior. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adverse experiences in early life are risk factors for the development of behavioral and physiological symptoms that can lead to psychiatric and cognitive disorders later in life. Some of these symptoms can be transmitted to the offspring, in some cases by non-genomic mechanisms involving germ cells. Using a mouse model of unpredictable maternal separation and maternal stress, we show that postnatal trauma alters coping behaviors in adverse conditions in exposed males when adult and in their adult male progeny. The behavioral changes are accompanied by increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and decreased DNA methylation of the GR promoter in the hippocampus. DNA methylation is also decreased in sperm cells of exposed males when adult. Transgenerational transmission of behavioral symptoms is prevented by paternal environmental enrichment, an effect associated with the reversal of alterations in GR gene expression and DNA methylation in the hippocampus of the male offspring. These findings highlight the influence of both negative and positive environmental factors on behavior across generations and the plasticity of the epigenome across life.

(1996) in the Journal of Psychopharmacology (10: 39-47). The early development of the paradigm by which rats were reared post-weaning in social isolation is described and compared with other early experience manipulations. The specification of the neural and behavioural phenotype of the isolate is brought up-to-date, focusing on changes in motivation and cognitive function, as well as on contrasting changes in the dopamine and serotonin systems, and in cortical (including hippocampal) structure and function. The relevance of the isolate for animal models of psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia is reviewed, and it is considered that the paradigm best exemplifies a manipulation that can be applied to test effects of certain forms of social adversity during adolescence on brain development and behaviour.

AB  - Chronic stress and depression are associated with decreased levels of hippocampal neurogenesis. On the other hand, antidepressants as well as environmental enrichment may rely in part on their pro-neurogenic effects to improve cognition and mood. Because a functional heterogeneity has been consistently reported along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, regional changes in neurogenesis could differentially contribute to these effects and affect distinct hippocampal functions. Mapping these regional changes could therefore provide a better understanding of the function of newborn neurons. While some studies report region-specific effects of stress and antidepressants on neurogenesis, it is unclear whether these changes affect distinct populations of newborn neurons according to their developmental stage in a region-specific manner. By using endogenous markers and BrdU labeling we quantified the regional changes in cell proliferation and survival as well as in the number of neuronal progenitors and immature neurons following unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), environmental enrichment (EE) and chronic fluoxetine (20 mg/kg/day) treatment along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. EE promoted cell proliferation and survival of 4-week-old newborn cells as well as increased the number and proportion of post-mitotic immature neurons specifically within the septal hippocampus. By contrast, UCMS uniformly decreased cell proliferation, survival and immature newborn neurons but differentially affected progenitor cells with a decrease restricted to the temporal regions of the hippocampus. Whereas fluoxetine treatment in control mice affected proliferation and survival specifically in the temporal hippocampus, it reversed most of the UCMS-induced alterations all along the septo-temporal axis. These results highlight that different factors known for exerting a mood improving effect differentially regulate neurogenesis along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. Such region and stage specific effects may correlate to distinct functional properties of newborn neurons along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus which may contribute differently to the pathophysiology of affective disorders.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is an animal management technique, which seems to improve adaptation to the experimental conditions of housing in laboratory animals. Previous studies have pointed to different beneficial effects of the procedure in the treatment of several disorders, including psychiatric conditions such as depression. The anxiolytic effects induced by EE, on the other hand, are not as clear. In fact, it has been proposed that EE acts as a mild stressor agent. To better understand the relationship of EE with anxiety-related responses, the present study exposed rats to one week of EE and subsequently tested these animals in the inhibitory avoidance and escape tasks of the elevated T-maze (ETM). In clinical terms, these responses have been respectively related to generalized anxiety and panic disorder. All animals were tested in an open field, immediately after the ETM, for locomotor activity assessment. Additionally, analysis of delta FosB protein immunoreactivity (FosB-ir) was used to map areas activated by EE exposure and plasma corticosterone measurements were performed. The results obtained demonstrate that exposure to EE for one week impaired avoidance responses, an anxiolytic-like effect, without altering escape reactions. Also, in animals submitted to the avoidance task EE exposure decreased FosB-ir in the cingulate cortex, dorsolateral and intermediate lateral septum, hippocampus (cornus of Ammon), anterior and dorsomedial hypothalamus, medial and basolateral amygdala and ventral region of the dorsal raphe nucleus. Although no behavioral differences were observed in animals submitted to the escape task, EE exposure also decreased FosB-ir in the cingulate cortex, hippocampus (dentate gyms), lateral amygdala, paraventricular, anterior and ventromedial hypothalamus, dorsomedial periaqueductal gray and ventral and dorsal region of the dorsal raphe. No changes in corticosterone levels, however, were observed. These results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of EE on anxiety.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) mimics positive life experiences by providing enhanced social and physical stimulation. Placement into EE following weaning, or in later life, confers beneficial outcomes on both emotional and cognitive processes. However, anxiety-like behavior is also reported, particularly in rats exposed to enhanced housing during early development. Notably, the quality of maternal behavior affects stress regulation and emotional stability in offspring, yet the impact of environmental context on maternal care has not been thoroughly evaluated, or are the influences of EE on their offspring understood. To investigate the role of EE on these factors we analyzed the details of mother-neonate interactions, and juvenile offspring performance on several anxiety measures. Additionally, we evaluated neurochemical differences (i.e. serotonin, corticosterone, GABA, glutamate) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus as a function of EE, Communal Nesting (CN) and Standard Care (SC). Although EE dams spent significantly less time on the nest and had lower nursing frequencies compared to SC dams, there were no differences in maternal licking/grooming. In offspring, EE increased GLUR1 level and GABA concentrations in the prefrontal cortex of both juvenile male and female rats. A similar pattern for glutamate was only observed in males. Although EE offspring spent less time on the open arms of the elevated plus maze and had faster escape latencies in a light-dark test, there were no other indications of anxiety-like behavior on these measures or when engaged in social interaction with a conspecific. In the wild, rats live in complicated and variable environments. Consequently dams must leave their nest to defend and forage, limiting their duration of direct contact. EE exposure in early development may mimic this naturalistic maternal separation, shaping parental behavior and offspring resiliency to stressors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is the main cause of mortality in the perinatal period and morbidity, in survivors, which is characterized by neurological disabilities. The immature brain is highly susceptible to hypoxicischemic insult and is responsive to environmental stimuli, such as environmental enrichment (EE). Previous results indicate that EE recovered memory deficits in adult rats without reversing hippocampal atrophy related to HI. The aim of this study was to investigate behavioral performance in the open field and rota-rod apparatuses, in object recognition and inhibitory avoidance tasks, as well as dendritic spine density in the hippocampus, in rats undergoing HI and exposed to EE. Seven-day old male rats were submitted to the HI procedure and divided into 4 groups: control maintained in standard environment (CTSE), controls submitted to EE (CTEE), HI in standard environment (HISE) and HI in EE (HIEE). Behavioral and morphological parameters were evaluated 9 weeks after the environmental stimulation. Results indicate impairment in the object recognition task after HI that was recovered by enrichment; however the aversive memory impairment in the inhibitory avoidance task shown by hypoxic-ischemic rats was independent of the environment condition. Hypoxic-ischemic groups showed more crossing responses during the first minute in the open field, when compared to controls, but no differences were found between experimental groups in the rotarod test. Dendritic spine density in the CA1 subfield of the right hippocampus (ipsilateral to the artery occlusion) was decreased after the HI insult, and increased in enriched controls; interestingly enriched HI rats did not differ from CTSE. In conclusion, EE was effective in recovering declarative memory impairment in object recognition and preserved hippocampal dendritic spine density loss after neonatal HI injury.

AB  - Severe depression compromises structural and functional integrity of the brain and results in impaired learning and memory, maladaptive synaptic plasticity as well as degenerative changes in the hippocampus and amygdala. The precise mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunctions in depression remain largely unknown. On the other hand, enriched environment (EE) offers beneficial effects on cognitive functions, synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. However, the effect of EE on endogenous depression associated cognitive dysfunction has not been explored. Accordingly, we have attempted to address this issue by investigating behavioural, structural and synaptic plasticity mechanisms in an animal model of endogenous depression after exposure to enriched environment. Our results demonstrate that depression is associated with impaired spatial learning and enhanced anxiety-like behaviour which is correlated with hypotrophy of the dentate gyrus and amygdalar hypertrophy. We also observed a gross reduction in the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We report a complete behavioural recovery with reduced indices of anhedonia and behavioural despair, reduced anxiety-like behaviour and improved spatial learning along with a complete restoration of dentate gyrus and amygdalar volumes in depressive rats subjected to EE. Enrichment also facilitated CA3-Schaffer collateral LTP. Our study convincingly proves that depression-induces learning deficits and impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity. It also highlights the role of environmental stimuli in restoring depression-induced cognitive deficits which might prove vital in outlining more effective strategies to treat major depressive disorders.

AB  - A number of clinical studies in which early adversities were defined retrospectively, demonstrated that early adverse experiences increased the morbidity rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in later life. However, no prospective studies have yet been conducted to elucidate whether early adversity affects the risk or severity of PTSD. Thus, we examined whether early adversity would strengthen the severity of PTSD symptoms in later life by using neonatal isolation (NI) and single prolonged stress (SPS) as an animal model of PTSD. We measured anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM), contextual freezing in the contextual fear (CF) test, and analgesia in the flinch-jump and hot-plate tests in four groups of adult rats (sham, NI, SPS, and NI + SPS). NI significantly enhanced the SPS-induced decrease in the percentage of open arm time and open arm entries in the EPM, enhanced the SPS-induced increase in contextual freezing, and strengthened SPS-induced analgesia, without any changes in locomotor activity in the open field locomotor test. In addition, we examined the effect of environmental enrichment (EE). Repeated exposure to EE ameliorated the NI-induced enhancement of contextual freezing, but not anxiety-like behavior or analgesia, in response to SPS. The results of the present study demonstrated that while early adversity strengthened PTSD-like symptoms, EE alleviated the enhanced contextual freezing by NI and SPS. These findings suggest that early adversity may worsen dysfunction of the amygdala and hippocampus in PTSD, and an early intervention may alleviate the early adversity-mediated enhancement of hippocampal dysfunction in PTSD.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Ample evidence indicates that chronic adolescence stress is associated with an increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood. Given the importance of the effective therapeutic ways to overcome adolescent stress-related deficits, the present study investigated the effects of Spirulina platensis (SP), environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary exercise (EX) and their combination on anxiety or depression-like behaviors, oxidative stress, and alterations of BDNF and 5HT-3 receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) induced by adolescent stress in adult female rats.
   Methods: During the adolescent period (PNDs30-40), rats were subjected to restraint stress. Then, the animals were subjected to SP treatment (200 mg/kg/day), EX, EE, and the combined treatments (SP+EX, and SP+EE) for 15 days between PNDs41-55. Subsequently, anxiety or depression-like behaviors, BDNF levels, oxidative stress markers and mRNA expression of BDNF and 5HT(3) in the PFC were assessed.
   Results: Stressed rats demonstrated enhanced anxiety levels and depression-like behaviors in adulthood. Regarding the oxidative stress markers, stressed rats exhibited significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and significantly lower total antioxidant reactivity capacity in the PFC. Additionally, adolescent stress significantly increased 5HT3 receptor mRNA expression and decreased BDNF content and its mRNA expression in the PFC. Treatments with SP, EX, EE, and the combined interventions alleviated these deficits.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that appropriate interventions during the adolescent period can protect against adolescent stress-induced behavioral, and biochemical defects and oxidative stress damage in adulthood.

AB  - Most quantifiable traits exhibit some degree of heritability. The heritability of physical traits is often high, but the heritability of some personality traits and intelligence can also be highly heritable. Importantly, estimates of heritability can change dramatically depending on such variables as the age or the environmental history of the sample from which the estimate is obtained. Interpretation of these changing estimates is complicated in studies of humans, where (based on correlational observations) environmental variables are hard to directly control or specify. Using laboratory mice, here we could control specific environmental variables. We assessed 58 groups of four full sibling male CD-1 genetically heterogeneous mice (n = 232). Using a standard full-sibling analysis, physical characteristics (body weight and brain weight) were highly heritable (h of body weight = 0.66 on a 0-1 scale), while behaviors indicative of a personality trait (exploration/boldness) and learning abilities (in a passive avoidance and egocentric maze task) were weakly-to-moderately heritable. Half of the siblings from each set of four were housed in an "enriched" environment, which provided extensive and varied opportunities for exploration. This enrichment treatment promoted improvements in learning and a shift toward a more bold personality type. Relative to animals in control ("impoverished" environments), the history of enrichment had significant impact on estimates of heritability. In particular, the heritability of behaviors related to the personality trait (exploration/boldness) more than doubled, and a similar increase was observed for learning (in the passive avoidance task). Physical traits (brain and body weight), however, were insensitive to environmental history (where in both environments, animals received the same diet). These results indicate that heritable traits can be responsive to variations in the environment, and moreover, that estimates of heritability of learning and personality traits are strongly influenced by environments that modulate those traits.

AB  - The translational assessment of mechanisms underlying cognitive functions using touchscreen-based approaches for rodents is growing in popularity. In these paradigms, daily training is usually accompanied by extended food restriction to maintain animals' motivation to respond for rewards. Here, we show a transient elevation in stress hormone levels due to food restriction and touchscreen training, with subsequent adaptation effects, in fecal corticosterone metabolite concentrations, indicating effective coping in response to physical and psychological stressors. Corticosterone concentrations of experienced but training-deprived mice revealed a potential anticipation of task exposure, indicating a possible temporary environmental enrichment-like effect caused by cognitive challenge. Furthermore, the analyses of immediate early gene (IEG) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus revealed alterations in Arc, c-Fos and zif268 expression immediately following training. In addition, BDNF expression was altered as a function of satiation state during food restriction. These findings suggest that standard protocols for touchscreen-based training induce changes in hippocampal neuronal activity related to satiation and learning that should be considered when using this paradigm.

AB  - The findings that antidepressive treatments increase hippocampal neurotrophins have led researchers to emphasize the importance of neurogenesis, formation of new dendrites, and survival of neurons in the brain. However, it is difficult to maintain neural plasticity just by enriching the environment to facilitate formation of new networks. Neural plasticity also requires a degradation process that clears off unnecessary and undesirable components. We have recently reported an increase in autophagy signaling (wherein the cell digests components of itself) that has the potential of enhancing neuronal and synaptic plasticity after multiple sessions of electroconvulsive seizure treatment. The present study revealed an increase in autophagy signaling in the rat hippocampus following 2 weeks of environmental enrichment (EE), a procedure known to elicit antidepressive and anxiolytic behavioral changes in various animal paradigms. Western blot analysis showed an increase in hippocampal expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), which is lipidated from LC3-I, in rats in the EE group. The effectiveness of the 2-week EE housing condition was validated by anxiolytic effects observed in the elevated plus maze test, enhanced habituation in the open field test, and elevation of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. In addition, we showed that the EE housing condition ameliorated numbing/avoidance behaviors, but not hypervigilant behaviors, in an animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is the first report to show that EE can increase autophagy signaling and improve numbing/avoidance behaviors in an animal model of PTSD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prenatal opioids exposure negatively affects the neurobehavioral abilities of children born from dependence dams. Adolescent housing conditions can buffer the detrimental impacts of early life experiences or contradictory can worsen individual psychosocial functions. The present study investigated the effects of maternal morphine dependence and different rearing conditions on behaviors and protein expression in brain reward circuits of male pups. Female Wistar rats a week before conception, during pregnancy and lactation were injected twice daily with escalating doses of morphine or saline. On a postnatal day 21, male pups were weaned and subjected to three different environments for two months: standard (STD), isolated (ISO), or enriched environment (EE). The anxiety and drug-related reward were measured using elevated plus maze, open field test, and conditioned place preference. Western blotting was used to determine the protein level of Delta FosB and mu-opioid receptor proteins in the striatum and the midbrain of male offspring, respectively. Results showed that maternal morphine administration dramatically increased anxiety-like and morphine place preference behaviors in offspring. Also, ISO condition aggravated these behavioral outcomes. While, rearing in EE could attenuate anxiety and morphine conditioning in pups. At molecular levels, maternal morphine exposure and social isolation markedly increased both of Delta FosB and mu-opioid receptor proteins expression. However, rearing in the EE declined Delta FosB protein expression. Together, these findings help to elucidate long lasting impacts of early life morphine exposure and rearing environment on the behavioral and molecular profile of addicted individuals.

AB  - The aims of the present study were (i) to investigate the effects of environmental enrichment during periadolescence on different behavioural and neurochemical responses in male CD-1 mice at adulthood and (ii) to describe the relative role of the physical and social components of the enrichment in producing these effects. Thirty 5-day-old mice were randomly assigned to one of the following housing conditions lasting five consecutive days: (i) individually housed in a standard cage, (ii) housed in pairs in a standard cage, (iii) individually housed in a physically enriched cage, and (iv) housed in pairs in a physically enriched cage. At adulthood, 80 days after the enrichment exposure, the explorative behaviour in an open field, as well as the behaviour in agonistic encounters, was evaluated in association with the analysis of selected central (hypothalamic levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived growth factor (BDNF)) and peripheral (plasma corticosterone levels) biochemical parameters. The results show that the long-term effects of the physical and the social enrichment are different and not additive. In particular, while social enrichment by itself exerted very limited effects, physical enrichment decreased the exploratory activity and altered social behaviour. Mice housed in pairs in air enriched cage showed low activity levels in the open field, and they tended to become more frequently dominant, although showing a more affiliative and less aggressive social interaction strategy. Furthermore, they presented low levels of hypothalamic NGF and high levels of brain-derived growth factor, suggesting an important effect of the combination of social and physical enrichment on neurobehavioral markers of brain plasticity and on animal ability to cope with social challenges.

AB  - The effects of early environmental enrichment (EE) and voluntary wheel running on the preference for using a landmark or pool geometry when solving a simple spatial task in adult male and female rats were assessed. After weaning, rats were housed in same-sex pairs in enriched or standard cages (EE and control groups) for two and a half months. Then the rats were trained in a triangular-shaped pool to find a hidden platform whose location was defined in terms of these two sources of information, a landmark outside the pool and a particular corner of the pool. As expected, enriched rats reached the platform faster than control animals, and males and females did not differ. Enriched rats also performed better on subsequent test trials without the platform with the cues individually presented (either pool geometry or landmark). However, on a preference test without the platform, a clear sex difference was found: Females spent more time in an area of the pool that corresponded to the landmark, whereas males spent more time in the distinctive corner of the pool. The present EE protocol did not alter females' preference for the landmark cue. The results agree with the claim that environmental enrichment is a consequence of a reduced anxiety response (measured by thigmotaxis) during cognitive testing. A possible implication of ancestral selection pressures is discussed.

AB  - Enrichment of milking environment through music has been proposed to help animals to cope with divergent stressors. In sight of the above, a study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Indian instrumental music-based environmental enrichment played in yaman raga on milk production performance and behaviour in cattle. A total of 21 lactating dairy cattle (Vrindavani crossbred cows) having similar parity and stage of lactation were selected in three groups - T1, T2 and T3, each consisting of seven animals. The T1 and T2 groups were exposed to instrumental flute and sitar, respectively, 10 min prior to the start of milking and continued till completion of milking; while the T3 group served as control. Musical enrichment of the environment was done using recorded-tape of flute and sitar was played in yamen raga at 40-60 (dB) decibel intensity. The results revealed a non-significant difference in milk yield, rectal temperature, respiration rate, T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) hormones. However, there exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) difference in milking time, milking speed, cortisol hormones and behavioural parameters such as milk let-down in the animals exposed to music compared to the control group. Thus, the results have significant implications relating to the behavioural fitness and welfare of dairy animals and reducing residual milk.

AB  - Captive environment in zoological parks often does not provide optimum conditions for natural behaviors due to spatial constraints and negative public reaction. These factors elicit stereotypic behavior in tigers such as pacing, head bobbing and aimless repetition of some movements, and are considered to be an indication of stress. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of captivity on the plasma cortisol level and behavioral pattern in Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris). Tigers kept in captivity at the Lahore zoo (n=4) and in semi natural environment at the Lahore Wildlife Park (n=6) were used for this study, and standard protocols of housing and sampling were observed. The mean plasma cortisol values for the captive animals and those kept in a semi natural environment were 34.48 +/- 1.33 and 39.22 +/- 3.16 mu g/dl, respectively. The difference was statistically non significant. Similarly, no significant difference in the plasma cortisol levels was observed among the individuals within each form of captivity. From the behavioral survey it was observed that the time spent in pacing and resting was much longer for captive animals than animals confined to the semi natural environment. Thus, technically monitored "Environmental Enrichment' plans need to be devised which are as close as possible to the natural environment of the captive animals in order to achieve their utmost performance.

AB  - Individual housing of social species is a common phenomenon in laboratory animal facilities. Single housing, however, is known to inflict social deprivation with a number of detrimental consequences. Aiming to improve housing conditions of single housed rodents, we investigated the simulation of social housing by mirrors in a series of behavioural experiments and biochemical parameters in mice. We found that chronic mirror-image stimulation increased exploratory behaviours in the holeboard and novel cage tests, but did not alter anxiety, locomotor, or depression-like behaviours. Moreover, no influence on visual recognition memory was observed. Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, a biomarker for enrichment effects, were unaltered. In line, mirror-image stimulation did not alter home cage behaviour in mice housed with and without mirrors when left undisturbed. Thus, though we found subtle behavioural effects after long-term mirror exposure, we conclude that the simulation of social housing by mirrors is not sufficient to gain the presumably beneficial outcomes induced by social housing.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric disease following exposure to a severe traumatic event or physiological stress, which is characterized by anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons that are susceptible to oxidative stress are a subset of inhibitory GABAergic neurons regulating the excitability of pyramidal neurons, while dysfunction of PV interneurons is casually linked to many mental disorders including PTSD. We therefore hypothesized that environmental enrichment (EE), a method of enhanced cognitive, sensory and motor stimulation, can reverse the behavioral impairments by normalizing PV interneurons in a rat model of PTSD induced by inescapable foot shocks (IFS). Behavioral changes were determined by the open field, elevated plus maze, fear conditioning, and Morris water maze tests. The levels of nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2), NOX4, PV, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD-67), and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were determined. Our results showed that in this PTSD model, rats displayed the anxiety-like behavior, enhanced fear learning behavior, and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory deficit, which were accompanied by the up-regulation of NOX2, 8-OH-dG, and down-regulation of PV and GAD-67. Notably, EE reversed all these abnormalities. These results suggest that restoration of PV interneurons by inhibiting oxidative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex might represent a mechanism through which EE reverses the behavioral impairments in a rat model of PTSD induced by IFS.

AB  - The persistence of anxiety and the deficit of fear memory extinction are both phenomena related to the symptoms of a trauma-related disorder, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recently we have shown that single acute restraint stress (2h) in rats induces a late anxiety-related behavior (observed ten days after stress), whereas, in the present work, we found that the same stress impaired fear extinction in animals conditioned ten days after stress. Fourteen days of environmental enrichment (EE) prevented the deleterious effect of stress on fear memory extinction. Additionally, we observed that EE prevented the stress-induced increase in AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit phosphorylation in the hippocampus, but not in the basolateral amygdala complex and the frontal cortex, indicating a potential mechanism by which it exerts its protective effect against the stress-induced behavioral outcome.

AB  - The number of patients with dry eye disease (DED) is increasing, and DED has become an urgent public health problem. A comorbidity of mental disorders has been reported in DED patients. We hypothesized that physical and psychological stressors impair tear secretion. To examine the relationship between stress loading and decreased tear secretion, we established a stress-induced DED mouse model, which permitted us to address the underlying mechanism of pathogenesis and resilience. Enriched environment (EE) was an effective intervention to prevent and alleviate stress-induced decreased tear secretion. Because stress loading resulted in decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression while EE resulted in increased expression, we focused on the role of BDNF in tear secretion. Using two distinct Bdnf gene knockdown mice, we evaluated whether BDNF was a deterministic factor in regulating tear secretion in healthy and stressed conditions. Bdnf knockdown mice showed decreased basal tear secretion and loss of stress tolerance by EE for tear secretion. These results suggest that BDNF expression is related to tear secretion and to the pathology of DED.

AB  - Background: Brain development is a prolonged process and it is sensitive to the environment during critical periods. Stress in early life is believed to increase vulnerability to depression, while enriched environment (EE) has beneficial effects on neural plasticity and depression. In this study, we compared the therapeutic effect of EE during different periods on early life stress-induced depression, and investigated the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and protein kinase B (AKT) on the effect of EE. Plasma corticosterone level was also detected to evaluate the reactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a 4-h maternal separation (MS) procedure during postnatal days 2-21. After this separation, the mice were assigned to standard environment groups (SE), EE in the early period groups (3-8 weeks, EEE) and EE in the adult groups (8-13 weeks, EEA). Depression and anxiety behavior were evaluated at 14-weeks of age. The plasma corticosterone was quantified utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hippocampus BDNF and AKT/p-AKT were detected using Western blotting. Results: The results showed that MS increased depression and anxiety level, while EE in both intervention periods alleviated the symptoms of depression and anxiety. The EEE group showed better effects in terms of anhedonia and anxiety than the EEA group. The difference in despair behavior between the EEE and EEA groups was not significant. MS increased plasma corticosterone level, while EE decreased corticosterone level in both intervention periods. EE increased BDNF and p-AKT expression in the hippocampus, with stronger effects in the EEE group. Conclusion: EE during the early development period was more effective in alleviating depression and anxiety induced by early life stress. BDNF and AKT may play a significant role in the effect of EE, and further research is needed to explore the detailed neurobiological mechanisms.

AB  - Results from basic and clinical studies demonstrate that stress and depression decrease neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis in brain, and that antidepressant treatment blocks or reverses these effects, leading to a neurotrophic hypothesis of depression. Neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis are also decreased during aging and could be risk factors for depression. In contrast, exercise and enriched environment increase neurotrophic support and neurogenesis, which could contribute to the blockade of the effects of stress and aging and produce antidepressant effects. A brief overview of this work and the specific neurotrophic factors involved are discussed in this review. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental factors play a significant role in well-being of laboratory animals. Regulations and guidelines recommend, if not require, that stressors such as bright lighting, smells, and noises are eliminated or reduced to maximize animal well-being. A factor that is often overlooked is handling and how researchers interact with their animals. Researchers, lab assistants, and husbandry staff in animal facilities may use inconsistent handling methods when interacting with rodents, but humans should be considered a part of the animal's social environment. This study examined the effects of different handling techniques on depressive-like behavior, measured by the Porsolt forced swim test, in adult C57BL/6J male mice. The same two researchers handled the mice in a gentle, aggressive, or minimal (control) fashion over approximately two weeks prior to testing. The results demonstrated a beneficial effect of gentle handling: gentle handling reduced swimming immobility in the forced swim test compared to mice that were aggressively or minimally handled. We argue that gentle handling, rather than methodical handling, can foster a better relationship between the handlers and rodents. Although handling is not standardized across labs, consistent gentle handling allows for less challenging behavioral testing, better data collection, and overall improved animal welfare.

AB  - The development of anxiety and depression due to chronic exposure to noise stress has remained as an unsolved health problem so far. Despite the studies suggesting the neuroenhancement effects of transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) and housing in an enriched environment (EE), the combined effects of these treatments have not been elucidated yet. Also, there is no available data on the relationship between the application of tPBM and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in animal models of stress. The present study aims to investigate the application of the tPBM and EE (alone or in combination) on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in a mice model of noise stress. Mice were divided into five groups: control, noise, noise + EE, noise + tPBM, and noise + EE + tPBM. Except for the control group, other groups were subjected to 110 dB SPL white noise for 4 h/day for 14 consecutive days and received their respective treatments. Forced Swimming Test (FST) was used to evaluate depressive-like behaviors. Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Open Field Test (OFT) were used to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors. BDNF, tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), and cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein levels in the hippocampus were determined by the Western blot method, and also serum corticosterone levels were assessed using an ELISA kit. Exposure to noise stress significantly elevated serum corticosterone level; downregulated hippocampal BDNF, TrkB, and CREB protein expressions; and resulted in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. While, the application of tPBM (810 nm wavelength, 8 J/cm(2) fluence, 10 Hz pulsed wave mode), housing in EE, and their combination lowered corticosterone levels, upregulated the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus, and improved behavioral outcomes in noise stress subjected mice. Our finding revealed the improving effects of tPBM and EE on depressive and anxiety-like behaviors induced by noise stress, possibly by augmenting the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) provides a non-pharmacological tool to alter drug-induced reward, yet its effects on ethanol-induced reward remain controversial. We analyzed adolescent vs. adult (mice) differences in the influence of EE on ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). The effects of these treatments on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the prefrontal cortex were examined in a separate group of animals. Ethanol-induced CPP was found in adults, and it was similar in EE and in animals reared under standard housing conditions (SC). Adolescents kept under EE, but not those in SC, exhibited CPP. Among SC, but not among EE, adolescents, BDNF levels were significantly lower in those treated with ethanol than in those given vehicle. These results indicate that, compared to adults, adolescent exhibited reduced sensitivity to ethanol's rewarding effects, yet the youth but not the adults exhibited sensitivity to the promoting effect of EE upon CPP by ethanol. Ethanol significantly reduced BDNF levels in adolescents reared under standard housing conditions, but not in adult mice nor in adolescents given EE housing conditions. The present results add to the plethora of adolescent-specific responses to ethanol or to environmental stimuli that may put the youth at risk for escalation of ethanol intake.

AB  - The influence of standard and high quality valuable feeding of pregnant mothers on behavior of the offspring that received the proinflammatory LPS stress was studied. The proinflammatory stress was induced on third and fifth postnatal days by subcutaneous injections of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, LPS (50 mcg/kg) to the rat's pups. At standard feeding of pregnant mothers an early LPS stress produced in their offspring a decrease of motor/investigatory activity and an increase of anxiety in an open field and elevated plus maze in adolescent age. The high quality and valuable feeding during pregnancy protected the offspring with early LPS stress from such changes of behavior. At the same time the high quality feeding did not remove the signs of depressive-like behavior seen in males and females in a sucrose preference test, and in males in a forced swimming test. The high quality and valuable feeding of pregnant females led to decrease of a growth the corticosterone level in response to stress impact in females after early proinflammatory stress. The data obtained indicate that the high quality and valuable feeding of pregnant females affects anxiety behavior and hormonal stress reactivity of their offspring.

AB  - Background: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is an important risk factor for depression and cognitive deficits in humans. Enriched environment (EE) showed a beneficial effect on depression and cognition by enhancing brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and synaptic plasticity. However, it is still not clearly understood whether an epigenetic mechanism is involved in the BDNF modulation and synaptic plasticity that occurs after EE treatment for the depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits elicited by CUMS. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of EE.
   Methods: All rats were exposed to the 5-week CUMS procedure except the control group. After CUMS procedure, some rats were stereotaxically injected with SIRT1 pharmacologic inhibitor EX527 or SIRT1 knocking down lentivirus (sh-SIRT1) in the hippocampus followed by EE treatment for 3 weeks. Other rats were directly subjected to EE treatment without stereotaxic injection. Behavioral tests were used to appraise depression and cognition after EE treatment. Then epigenetic molecules, synaptic proteins, dendritic spine density and branches, and synaptic morphology of the dorsal hippocampus were determined.
   Results: We found that CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors including decreased sucrose preference ratio, prolonged immobility and reduced locomotor and exploratory activity; cognitive deficits including spatial learning and memory impairment; reduced dendritic spine density and number of branches; thinned post-synaptic density; downregulated SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway, decreased BDNF and synaptic proteins including synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expression in the hippocampus. However, the CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors, cognitive deficits, dendritic spine density and branch number reduction, postsynaptic density thinning, SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway downregulation, BDNF and synaptic proteins reduction, including synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), were reversed by EE treatment. However, depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits were observed again in rats subjected to stereotaxic injection with EX527 or sh-SIRT1. Furthermore, this study also found that SIRT1/microRNA-134 regulates the downstream molecules BDNF, and the synaptic proteins SYN and PSD95 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the neuroprotective role of EE on depression and cognitive deficits by activating the SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway, which accounts for the regulation of synaptic proteins, including BDNF, PSD95 and SYN, dendritic remodeling and ultrastructure changes of synapses in the hippo-campus.

AB  - Background
   Exposure to chronic stress has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional processing. Also, the neuroprotective influences of environmental enrichment (EE) and royal jelly (RJ) have been indicated in previous studies.
   Aims
   To our knowledge, to date, there are no studies about the synergistic effects of EE and RJ on cognitive changes induced by stress. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of RJ, and EE on anxiety-like behaviors, cognitive functions, and expression of hippocampal and also prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in stressed rats.
   Methods
   By using restraint and cold temperature, rats were exposed to stressful situations and then subjected to treatment with RJ or/ and EE for 14 days. Stress induction was done 14 days before treatments by placing the rats in the restrainer under 4 degrees C. Following the interventions, anxiety-like behaviors, novel object recognition memory (NORM), inhibitive avoidance performance, hippocampal, and PFC BDNF expression were examined. The plasma corticosterone level of all groups was also evaluated.
   Results
   Results showed increased plasma corticosterone levels, stress-induced deficits in the NORM and IA tests, and increased anxiety-like behaviors. EE and RJ improved these deficits with a decline in serum corticosterone and also increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus and PFC in stressed ones.
   Conclusion
   The EE and the RJ prevented the detrimental effects of stress on anxiety-like behaviors and memory processes. These treatments can protect susceptible brain areas against chronic stress via improvement in behavioral and cognitive impairments through mediating BDNF expression.

AB  - Prolonged permanence of animals under social isolation (SI) arouses a variety of psychological symptoms like aggression, stress, anxiety and depression. However, short-term SI is commonly used to evaluate social memory. Interestingly, the social memory cannot be accessed with delays higher than 30 min in SI mice. Our hypothesis is that SI with intermediate duration, like one week (1 w), impairs the long-term storage of new social information (S-LTM), without affecting anxiety or other types of memories, because the SI compromises the olfactory function of the animal. Our results demonstrated that SI impaired S-LTM, without affecting other kinds of memory or anxiety. In addition, the SI increased the latency in the buried-food finding task, but did not affect the habituation or the discrimination of odors. Next, we postulated that if continuous input to the olfactory system is fundamental for the maintenance of the olfactory function and social memory persistence, isolated mice under odor-enriched environment (OEE) should behave like group-housed (GH) animals. In fact, the OEE prevented the S-LTM deficit imposed by the SI. However, OEE did not restore the SI mice olfaction to the GH mice level. Our results suggest that SI modulates olfaction and social memory persistence, probably, by independent mechanisms. We also showed for the first time that OEE rescued S-LTM in SI mice through a mechanism not necessarily involved with olfaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research into cat behavior has gained more attention in recent years. As one of the world's most popular companion animals, work in this field has potential to have wide-reaching benefits. Cats living in shelters are posed with distinct welfare concerns. Shelter cat welfare can be increased through use of environmental enrichment to promote natural behaviors. This review focuses on relevant literature published to date on shelter cat enrichment. Several key areas of research were identified. These included sensory enrichment, feeding enrichment, physical enrichment, social enrichment, and assessments to determine cat preference for enrichment stimuli. Existing studies have examined the efficacy of enrichment to promote species-specific behaviors and to reduce stress in shelter cats. Studies have also explored housing conditions for shelter cats such as cage size, communal housing, or the general quality of the environment. Applications of this information are discussed in order to promote natural cat behavior and find ways to increase the welfare of shelter cats. A review of the literature highlights the importance of supplying novel items in shelter environments, providing a rotation of individually preferred items, the use of human social interaction as a way to increase interactive behaviors in shelter cats, and the importance of considering potentially aversive impacts of enrichment under certain situations.

AB  - Glucocorticoid hormones are important for coping with stress but may have deleterious effects on mood and memory during prolonged excessive secretion. A key abnormality related to cortisol excess in delirium seems to be abnormal 'shut-off' of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis tested by the dexamethasone suppression test. In experimental models, the hippocampal formation is of prime importance for normal HPA axis shut-off. In this brain area, a close interaction between neurotransmittors, notably acetylcholine, serotonin and noradrenaline, and glucocorticoid receptors, is present and possibly relevant for the development of delirium in elderly patients with stroke and neurodegenerative brain diseases.

AB  - Although environmental enrichment has been shown to improve functional and histologic outcomes in pre-clinical moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), there are a paucity of pre-clinical data regarding enrichment strategies in the setting of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI). Given the vast numbers of athletes and those in the military who sustain rmTBI, the mounting evidence of the long-term and progressive sequelae of rmTBI, and the lack of targeted therapies to mitigate these sequelae, successful enrichment interventions in rmTBI could have large public health significance. Here, we evaluated enrichment strategies in an established pre-clinical rmTBI model. Seventy-one male C57BL/6 mice were randomized to two different housing conditions, environmental enrichment (EE) or normal condition (NC), then subjected to rmTBI injury (seven injuries in 9 days) or sham injury (anesthesia only). Functional outcomes in all four groups (NC-TBI, EE-TBI, NC-sham, and EE-sham) were assessed by motor, exploratory/anxiety, and mnemonic behavioral tests. At the synaptic level, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit expression of phosphorylated glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and calpain were evaluated by western blot. Compared to injured NC-TBI mice, EE-TBI mice had improved memory and decreased anxiety and exploratory activity post-injury. Treatment with enrichment also corresponded to normal NMDAR subunit expression, decreased GluR1 phosphorylation, decreased phosphorylated CaMKII, and normal calpain expression post-rmTBI. These data suggest that enrichment strategies may improve functional outcomes and mitigate synaptic changes post-rmTBI. Given that enrichment strategies are feasible in the clinical setting, particularly for athletes and soldiers for whom the risk of repetitive injury is greatest, these data suggest that clinical trials may be warranted.

AB  - The exposure of rats to an enriched environment (EE) has several effects in common with the administration of antidepressants. However, there is still little information about the molecular underpinnings of these effects on rats subjected to experimental models of depression. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of EE on rats exposed to the learned helplessness paradigm (LH), a well-known model of the disease. We found that a 21 day exposure to EE reverts helplessness behavior to normal in LH animals. Inmunohistochemical labeling showed that this effect was accompanied by normalization of two structural proteins of hippocampal neurons to control values: the light neurofilament subunit (NFL) and the postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) protein, which were decreased in LH animals housed in standard cages. The decrease in the presynaptic protein synaptophysin (SYN) observed in LH animals remained unchanged after exposure to EE. There was no increase in neurogenesis as measured by quantification of double-labeled cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and the neuronal marker beta-tubulin class Ill. These results show that EE may have behavioral and synaptic effects on animals exposed to an experimental model of depression, and that such actions seem to be independent from neurogenesis.

AB  - Challenging animals with a demanding situation they are able to cope with and where they are rewarded may be a source of positive emotions and possibly of increased welfare. In order to test if this results in changes of immunological parameters and wound healing, 56 pigs (7-20 weeks of age), housed in groups of 8 animals each, were successfully trained to recognize and localize an individual acoustic summons and to receive a small portion of feed as a reward. Immune reactions and the development of a standardized biopsy wound were compared to values of conventionally fed control groups of equal size and animal-to-feeding-place ratio (2:1). In the experimental animals a significantly higher concentration of IgG as well as an increased in vitro T-cell proliferation to ConA but a reduced LPS-induced proliferation of B-cells was found, while basal salivary cortisol concentrations were similar. Wound development was better in the experimental animals as measured by the area of the inflammatory corona. It decreased more rapidly in the experimental animals since the 5th day after biopsy and was significantly smaller than in the control groups. We conclude that environmental enrichment by equipment provoking attention and cognitive activity which is rewarded by feed may play a beneficial role for physical welfare of intensively housed pigs.

AB  - Access to outdoor areas is provided as a means of enhancing welfare in commercial systems for laying hens (Gallus gallus domesticus), but substantial individual differences exist in their proportional use. Baseline cell proliferation levels of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis (AHN) have been associated with individual differences in reactive vs. proactive coping style, and in both mammals and birds, AHN is upregulated by positive experiences including environmental enrichment and exercise. We thus sought to explore whether individual differences in use of outdoor areas and in tonic immobility responses (indicative of fearfulness) were associated with hippocampal cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Radio frequency identification technology was used to track the ranging behavior of 440 individual focal hens within a commercially-relevant system over a 72-days period, after which tonic immobility durations were measured. Following hippocampal tissue collection from 58 focal hens, proliferation and neuronal differentiation were measured through quantitative PCR for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and doublecortin mRNA, respectively. Individual differences in tonic immobility duration positively correlated with PCNA expression over the whole hippocampal formation, while greater time spent in outdoor areas (the grassy range and stone yard) was associated with higher proliferation in the rostral subregion. Basal proliferation in the chicken hippocampal formation may thus relate to reactivity, while levels in the rostral region may be stimulated by ranging experience. Doublecortin expression in the caudal hippocampus negatively co-varied with time on the grassy range, but was not associated with tonic immobility duration. This suggests that ranging outside may be associated with stress. Within laying hen flocks, individual differences in hippocampal plasticity thus relate to coping style and use of external areas.

AB  - Pigs living in commercial husbandry systems may experience both acute stress due to standard management procedures and chronic stress through limitations in their barren housing environment. This might influence their immune status, including antibody responses to neural and danger autoantigens. Levels of natural autoantibody (NAAb)-binding phosphorylcholine-conjugated bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were measured over time in pigs that were kept in environmental enriched v. barren housing, and that underwent a regrouping test. In total, 480 pigs were housed in 80 pens in either barren or straw-enriched pens from 4 through 23 weeks of age. Blood samples were taken from pigs before (week 8), and 3 days after a 24 h regrouping test (week 9), and at 22 weeks of age. Phosphorylcholine-conjugated bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) and MBP antibody titres in serum were measured using ELISA. Enriched-housed pigs had higher levels of IgM-binding MBP, and tended to have higher levels of IgG-binding MBP and IgA-binding PC-BSA than barren-housed pigs. Each NAAb measured in this study was affected by gender and litter. These results suggest that enriched housing conditions, as well as acute regrouping stress, have an influence on levels of serum NAAb-binding danger and neural antigens in pigs.

AB  - Although the effects of environmental enrichment on laboratory rodents have been extensively described, it is not yet known whether these effects were simply due to the presence of multiple items in the cage or due solely to the presence of a particular item. This experiment was therefore carried out to investigate whether the long-term effects of enriching cages of laboratory rats are due to the presence of multiple physical structures or due simply to the presence of a particular structure in the cage. in a two-replicate study, 96 newly weaned male Wistar rats were housed in groups of four in either retreat cages (RC), ladder cages (LC), crawling ball cages (CBC), nylabone cages (NC), wooden block cages (WBC) or multiple items cages (MIC) for five weeks. Behaviour was sampled in both the light and dark phase of the light/dark cycle every week. Measures of body weight and weight gain were collected over the five-week housing period, and organ weights were recorded postmortem. MIC rats displayed higher levels of indicators of good welfare such as sleep and enrichment-directed behaviour, and weight of spleen and thymus gland, and lower levels of indicators of poor welfare such as aggression and awake non-active behaviour, compared to rats in the other treatments. MIC rats also spent a longer time in the open part of the cage and contacting enrichment items. It therefore appears that increasing the diversity of enrichment by the addition of multiple physical structures to cages of laboratory rats may have the potential to improve their welfare not only by increasing the complexity of the environment, but also by promoting species-specific behaviours and providing the animals with opportunities to exert some control over their environment.

AB  - The toxicity of Tityus bahiensis scorpion venom is well known, but there are little data about the damage in offspring of dams that were exposed to the venom during pregnancy. The objective of this work was to determine the toxic effects of venom in adult offspring of Wistar rats exposed to venom in utero. Dams were divided into a control group, subcutaneously injected with saline solution on the 10th (GD10) and 16th (GD16) days, and two experimental groups, subcutaneously injected with venom (2.5 mg/kg) on GD10 or GD16, respectively. Adult offspring were evaluated according to behavioral development and neuronal integrity in the hippocampus. Tests performed in the activity box and in the enriched environment demonstrated that males from GD10 had motor decrease. Females from GD10 showed a depressive-like state and were more anxious, as demonstrated by the forced swimming test and social interaction. The plus-maze discriminative avoidance task demonstrated that GD16 males had lower levels of anxiety. The number of neuronal cells was decreased in CA1, CA3 and CA4 hippocampal areas of males and females from GD10 group and in CA1 of females and CA4 of males from GD16 group. Thus, we conclude that venom exposure in pregnant dams causes subtle alteration in the behavioral and neuronal development of offspring in adult life in a gender-dependent manner.

AB  - Both social and physical stimuli contribute to the complexity of an animal's environment, influencing biobehavioral responses to subsequent challenges. In the current study, male Long-Evans rats were randomly assigned to an isolate (ISO), social control (SC) or social enriched (SE) group (n = 8 per group). The SC and SE conditions were group housed with the SE group exposed to physical enrichment stimuli that were natural as opposed to manufactured (e.g., hollowed out log instead of plastic hiding place). On three occasions during their 40-day enriched environment exposure, night/dark phase videos were obtained for 1 h during the early part of the dark phase. During this time, the SE animals exhibited significantly more social grooming with no differences between the SE and SC in the frequency of play or self-grooming bouts. Subsequently, all animals were assessed in social interaction and problem-solving escape tasks during the last week of the enriched environment exposure. SE rats exhibited increased digging bouts toward the restrained conspecific in the social interaction task whereas the other groups exhibited more escape responses. In the problem-solving task, SE animals exhibited a decreased latency to cross the barrier to escape from the predator odor (i.e., cat urine and fur). Neural analyses indicated increased oxytocin-immunoreactive (OT-ir) tissue in the SE supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus compared to the other groups. Interestingly, blood samples indicated lower peripheral corticosterone (CORT) and higher OT levels in the ISO animals when compared to the SC and SE animals, an effect retrospectively attributed to separation anxiety in the SE and SC animals in preparation for histology procedures. When the behavioral, neural and endocrine data were visualized as a multifaceted dataset via a multidimensional scaling analysis, however, an association between social enrichment and higher OT involvement was observed in the SE animals, as well as heightened stress responsivity in the ISO and SC groups. In sum, the SE animals exhibited a facilitation of social responses, problem-solving ability and OT immunoreactive responsiveness. These findings provide new information about the influences of both physical and social stimuli in dynamic and enriched environments.

AB  - Enrichment is widely used as a tool for studying how changes in environment affect animal behavior. Here, we report an experimental study investigating if behaviors shaped by stimuli from environmental enrichment depending on the stage animals are exposed to enrichment. We used juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in their first autumn. This is a species commonly reared for conservation purposes. Previous work has shown that environmental enrichment had no effect on long-term survival when the fry stage (smaller than 70 mm) was released, but that if late parr stages (larger than 70 mm) are released, enrichment is reported to have a positive effect on smolt migration survival. Here, we explored the effect of enrichment at two different stages of development. Both stages were reared and treated for 7 weeks (fry at 11-18 weeks and parr at 24-31 weeks after hatching) before tested for behavior. Responses known to be associated with exploratory behavior, activity, and stress coping were quantified by testing 18-week-old fry and 31-week-old parr in a six-chamber maze on 7 successive days after rearing in structurally enriched (plastic plants and tubes) or plain impoverished rearing environments. The data show that Atlantic salmon are sensitive to stimuli from structural enrichment when they are parr, but not when in the fry stage. Parr deprived of enrichment (control treatment) were reluctant to start exploring the maze, and when they did, they spent a longer time frozen than enriched parr, suggesting that deprivation of enrichment at this life can be stressful. Our data suggest that structural enrichment could have the potential to improve welfare for salmonids in captivity and for survival of released juvenile salmon if structural enrichment is provided at the parr stage and the fish reared for conservation are released at the parr stage.

AB  - A growing body of evidence showed that environmental enrichment (EE) ameliorated footshock-induced fear behavior of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no research comprehensively tested the effect of EE, cue, and the combination of EE and cue in footshock-induced fear behavior of PTSD symptoms. The present study addressed this issue and examined whether the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, including the cingulate cortex 1 (Cg1), prelimbic cortex (PrL), and infralimbic cortex (IL)), the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the hippocampus (e.g., CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG)) regulated the amelioration of the EE, cue, or the combination of EE and cue. The results showed that EE or cue could reduce fear behavior. The combination of EE and cue revealed a stronger decrease in fear behavior. The cue stimulus may play an occasion setting or a conditioned stimulus to modulate the reduction in fear behavior induced by footshock. Regarding the reduction of the EE in fear behavior, the Cg1 and IL of the mPFC and the NAc upregulated the c-Fos expression; however, the BLA downregulated the c-Fos expression. The mPFC (i.e., the Cg1, PrL, and IL) and the hippocampus (i.e., the CA1, CA3, and DG) downregulated the c-Fos expression in the suppression of the cue in fear behavior. The interaction of EE and cue in reduction of fear behavior occurred in the Cg1 and NAc for the c-Fos expression. The data of c-Fos mRNA were similar to the findings of the c-Fos protein expression. These findings related to the EE and cue modulations in fear behavior may develop a novel nonpharmacological treatment in PTSD.

AB  - Rats deprived of social contact with other rats at a young age experience a form of prolonged stress that leads to long-lasting changes in behavioral profile. Such isolation is thought to be anxiogenic for these normally gregarious animals, and the abnormal reactivity of isolated rats to environmental stimuli is thought to be a product of prolonged stress. We now show that isolation of rats at weaning reduced immobility time in the forced swim test, decreased sucrose intake and preference, and down-regulated both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein (Arc) in the hippocampus. In the Morris water maze, isolated rats showed a reduced latency to reach the hidden platform during training, indicative of an improved learning performance, compared with group-housed rats. The cumulative search error during place training trials indicated a reliable difference between isolated and group-housed rats on days 4 and 5. The probe trial revealed a significant decrease of the average proximity to the target location in the isolated rats suggesting an improvement in spatial memory.
   Isolated rats also showed an increase in the plasma level of corticosterone on the 5th day of training and increased expression of BDNF and Arc in the hippocampus on both days 1 and 5. These results show that social isolation from weaning in rats results in development of depressive-like behavior but has a positive effect on spatial learning, supporting the existence of a facilitating effect of stress on cognitive function.

AB  - The hippocampus is particularly involved in cognitive processes and is a key regulator of stress responses and emotions. Therefore, the role of adult-born neurons in this region has become a crucial field of research in order to understand mood and stress disorders, such as major depression. Many studies have characterized the role of these neurons in cognition, mood regulation and antidepressant actions. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underpinning these antidepressant effects remain unclear. In this review, we first discuss the effects of stress and antidepressant treatments on adult-born neurons, and subsequently, the role and mechanisms of neurogenesis in antidepressant action. Some studies have shown that adult-born neurons could affect overall hippocampal activity, thus normalizing the latter which could restore neuronal pathways underlying antidepressant effects.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is widely used to improve welfare and behavioral performance of animal species. It ensures housing of laboratory animals in environments with space and complexity that enable the expression of their normal behavioral repertoire. Auditory enrichment by exposure to classical music decreases abnormal behaviors and endocrine stress responses in humans, non-humans primates, and rodents. However, little is known about the role of auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish. Given the growing importance of zebrafish for neuroscience research, such studies become critical. To examine whether auditory enrichment by classical music can affect fish behavior and physiology, we exposed adult zebrafish to 2 h of Vivaldi's music (65-75 dB) twice daily, for 15 days. Overall, zebrafish exposed to such auditory stimuli were less anxious in the novel tank test and less active, calmer in the light-dark test, also affecting zebrafish physiological (immune) biomarkers, decreasing peripheral levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the activity of some CNS genes, without overt effects on whole-body cortisol levels. In summary, we report that twice-daily exposure to continuous musical sounds may provide benefits over the ongoing 50-55 dB background noise of equipment in the laboratory setting. Overall, our results support utilizing auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish to reduce stress and improve welfare in this experimental aquatic organism.

AB  - Promoter IV-driven expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a major neuronal growth factor, is implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression. We previously reported that mice lacking expression of BDNF through promoter IV (BDNF-KIV mice) exhibit a depression-like phenotype. Here, we examined whether the depression-like phenotype and decreased levels of BDNF because of promoter IV deficit could be rescued by enriched environment (EE) treatment, a potential antidepressant intervention. Three weeks of EE treatment rescued depression-like behavior of BDNF-KIV mice as assessed by the tail suspension test, open-field test and sucrose preference test. EE treatment also increased BDNF transcripts driven by multiple endogenous promoters and restored BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus (HIP) of BDNF-KIV mice. Further, we investigated adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a possible cellular mechanism underlying the depression-like behavior and its recovery in BDNF-KIV mice. We found that the number of surviving progenitors and their dendritic length in the dentate gyrus of the HIP were reduced in BDNF-KIV mice compared with the control wild-type mice. EE treatment restored the reduction in cell survival and dendritic length and increased cell proliferation in BDNF-KIV mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that EE rescued depression-like behavior, decreased BDNF levels and defective neurogenesis in the HIP caused by lack of promoter IV-driven BDNF expression. These results suggest that decreased BDNF levels because of one impaired promoter can be compensated by other BDNF promoters and that BDNF levels may be one of the key factors regulating depression and antidepressant effects through hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Background: Prenatal environmental enrichment (EE) has been proven to positively affect but prenatal stress negatively influence the physiological and psychological processes in animals, whose trans-generational genetic mechanism remains unclearly defined. We aimed to investigate and find out key genes underlying the positive-negative effects derived from prenatal interventions.
   Materials and Methods: Pregnant rats were randomized into EE group (EEG), earthquake simulation group (ESG), herbal group (HG) received herbal supplements in feed after earthquake simulation, and control group (CG).
   Results: Light Box Defecation Test (LBDT) showed EEG offspring presented less fecal pellets than CG offspring, ESG's more than CG's, and HG's less than ESG (p's<0.05). Open-field Test (OFT) score of EEG was higher than CG offspring, of ESG's was lower than CG's, and HG's higher than ESG's. Irf7 and Ninj were screened, which were up-regulated in EEG, down-regulated in ESG (FC<0.5), and were neutralized in HG. Prenatal EE could positively promote the nervous system development, prenatal earthquake simulation could retard the nervous system development and Chinese herbal remedy (JKSQW) which could correct the retardation.
   Conclusion: The negative-positive prenatal effect could contribute to altered gene expression of Irf7 and Ninj2 which also could play a key role in the improving function of JKSQW for the kidneys.

AB  - Providing captive foxes with relevant enrichment objects may support their ability to cope with barren housing systems and thus have positive welfare effects. The relevance of enrichment objects is, among others, related to animals' preference that should be examined prior to supplementing their housing environment. In this study, we assessed 30 juvenile, singly housed silver foxes' short-term preference for five different oral enrichment objects based on their immediate use of the objects when they were given simultaneous access after one week of deprivation. Also, wear and tear after one week of continuous access was assessed as a measure of use and to estimate the robustness and durability of various objects. A cattle femur bone was clearly the first ranked object (P <= 0.05), followed by a rawhide bone, a mutual pulling device mounted between neighbouring cages, and straw and a plastic cube as the least used objects. All of the objects were, to a various degree, gnawed by the foxes. After one week of use, about 30% of the cattle bone mass was consumed, compared to about 88% of the rawhide bone mass. Although the plastic cubes were almost indestructible and therefore durable objects their low ranking do not necessarily make them good enrichment objects for foxes. Offering meat bones to captive foxes provide the animals with biologically relevant stimuli that elicit oral manipulation and play, behaviours with potential rewarding effects to the animals.

AB  - Stress is related to major depressive disorder (MDD). This study investigated the action that early stress, represented by maternal deprivation (MD), has on the behavior and oxidative stress of Wistar female and male rats. Also, it was evaluated whether changes induced by MD could be reversed by environmental enrichment (EE). Male and female rats were divided into a non-MD and MD group. The MD group was subdivided into 3 groups: (1) assessed on the 31(st) day after exposure to EE for 10 days, (2) assessed on the 41(st) day after exposure to EE for 20 days, and (3) assessed on the 61(st) day after exposure to EE for 40 days. Behavioral tests were performed (memory habituation and elevated plus maze). Oxidative stress parameters were evaluated peripherally. MD was able to promote anxiety-like behavior at postnatal day (PND) 41 and impair memory at PND 31 and PND 61 in male and PND 41 and PND 61 in female rats. MD was associated with increased oxidative stress parameters (reactive species to thiobarbituric acid levels (TBARS), carbonylated proteins, nitrite/nitrate concentration), and altered antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and sulfhydryl content) in different stages of development. The EE was able to reverse almost all behavioral and biochemical changes induced by MD; however, EE effects were sex and developmental period dependent. These findings reinforce the understanding of the gender variable as a biological factor in MDD related to MD and EE could be considered a treatment option for MDD treatment and its comorbidities.

AB  - Our prior research has shown that environmental enrichment (i.e. rats reared in an environment with novel objects, social contact with conspecifics) produces a protective antidepressant-like phenotype in rats and decreases neurobiological effects of acute psychological stress. Although CREB activity has been identified as a major player, the downstream molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Thus, the current study investigates proteomic differences in the accumbens of rats raised in an enriched condition (EC) versus those raised in an isolated control condition (IC) under basal conditions and after 30 min of acute restraint stress. Results showed that under basal conditions, EC rats generally expressed less mitochondria-related proteins, particularly those involved in TCA cycle and electron transport compared to IC rats. After 30 min of acute stress, EC rats displayed increased expression of energy metabolism enzymes (among others) while IC rats exhibited decreased expression of similar proteins. Further, network and pathway analyses also identified links to AKT signaling proteins, 14-3-3 family proteins, heat-shock proteins, and ubiquitin-interacting proteins. The protein ENO1 showed marked differential expression and regulation; EC rats expressed higher levels under basal conditions that increased subsequent to stress, while the basal IC expression was lower and decreased further still after stress. The results of this study define differential protein expression in a protective rat model for major depression and additionally identify a dynamic and coordinated differential response to acute stress between the two groups. These results provide new avenues for exploration of the molecular determinants of depression and the response to acute stress.

AB  - Environmental factors acting on young animals affect neurodevelopmental trajectories and impact adult brain function and behavior. Psychiatric disorders may be caused or worsen by environmental factors, but early interventions can improve performance. Understanding the possible mechanisms acting upon the developing brain could help identify etiological factors of psychiatric disorders and enable advancement of effective therapies. Research has focused on the long-lasting effects of environmental factors acting during the perinatal period, therefore little is known about the impact of these factors at later ages when neurodevelopmental pathologies such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are usually diagnosed. Here we show that handling mice during the juvenile period can rescue a range of behavioral and cellular effects of prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure. VPA-exposed animals show reduced sociability and increased repetitive behaviors, along with other autism-related endophenotypes such as increased immobility in the forced swim test and increased neuronal activity in the piriform cortex (Pir). Our results demonstrate that briefly handling mice every other day between postnatal days 22 and 34 can largely rescue these phenotypes. This effect can also be observed when animals are analyzed across tests using an "autism" factor, which also discriminates between animals with high and low Pir neuron activity. Thus, we identified a juvenile developmental window when environmental factors can determine adult autism-related behavior. In addition, our results have broader implications on behavioral neuroscience, as they highlight the importance of adequate experimental design and control of behavioral experiments involving treating or testing young animals.

AB  - Maternal malnutrition is one of the major early-life adversities affecting the development of newborn's brain and is associated with an increased risk to acquire cognitive and emotional deficiencies later in life. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that exposure to an enriched environment (EE) can reverse the negative consequences of early adversities. However, rescue of emotional disorders caused by perinatal malnutrition and the mechanisms involved has not been determined. We hypothesized that exposure to an EE may attenuate the anxiety-like disorders observed in mice subjected to perinatal protein malnutrition and that this could be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Male CF-1 mice were subject to perinatal protein malnutrition until weaning and then exposed to an EE for 5 weeks after which small RNA-seq was performed. In parallel, dark-light box and elevated plus maze tests were conducted to evaluate anxiety traits. We found that exposure to an EE reverses the anxiety-like behavior in malnourished mice. This reversal is paralleled by the expression of three miRNAs that become dysregulated by perinatal malnutrition (miR-187-3p, miR-369-3p and miR-132-3p). The predicted mRNA targets of these miRNAs are mostly related to axon guidance pathway. Accordingly, we also found that perinatal malnutrition leads to reduction in the cingulum size and altered oligodendrocyte morphology. These results suggest that EE-rescue of anxiety disorders derived from perinatal malnutrition is mediated by the modulation of miRNAs associated with the regulation of genes involved in axonal guidance.

AB  - This research aims to evaluate the effects of different types and strategies of environmental enrichment for weaned pigs on behavior. Forty weaned piglets aged 21 to 28 days were distributed in a completely randomized design in five treatments: without enrichment object, full-time cognitive enrichment, intermittent cognitive enrichment, alternate cognitive and sensory enrichment every 24 hours, and alternate cognitive and sensory enrichment every 48 hours. Behavioral observations were made for 15 days considering pig as experimental unit. Pigs of control and continuous cognitive enrichment treatments were submitted to human approach test, novel arena test, and novel object test. Pigs kept in an unstimulated environment show a higher frequency of unwanted behaviors compared to pigs in other treatments regardless of enrichment type. Pigs with alternation of enrichment type every 24 hours showed a longer interaction time with enrichment objects. Enrichment objects in rearing environment during nursery phase reduced undesirable behaviors and reactivity to unknown situations. Strategies such as alternating the type of enrichment every 24 or 48 hours are effective in maintaining the novelty and the animals' interest.

AB  - Epilepsy is a relatively common and chronic neurological condition, affecting 1-2% of the population. However, understanding of the underlying pathophysiology remains incomplete. To identify potential factors in the early environment that may increase the risk for experiencing seizures, maternal stress and environmental enrichment (EE) were utilized. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were exposed to an ethologically relevant predator stress (PS) and maternal glucocorticoid (GC) response was assessed across the exposure period. At birth, litters were divided into standard care (SC) and EE groups until postnatal day 14 (PD14) when a model of febrile convulsions was used to determine seizure susceptibility of the various groups. Pup brains were then processed for immunohistochemical detection of FosB from several structures in the limbic system as a measure of neuronal activation. Maternal PS-induced GC levels were elevated early in the exposure period, and pup birth weights, in both sexes, were lower in litters from dams exposed to PS. Seizure scores at PD14 were highly individualized and litter dependent, suggesting a dam-dependent and variable effect of controlled pre- and postnatal environmental factors. Further, analysis of FosB-immunoreactive (-ir) patterns revealed an activity dependent distribution, reflecting individual seizure susceptibility. EE had a varying effect on FosB-ir that was dependent on region. In the hippocampus FOsB-ir levels were greater in the EE groups while extra-hippocampal regions showed lower levels of FosB-ir. Our results support the concept that pre- and postnatal environmental influences affect fetal programming and neurodevelopment of processes that could underlie seizure susceptibility, but that the magnitude of these effects appears to be dam- or litter-dependent.

AB  - Previously observed antidepressant-like effects of caffeine in adolescent rats have been shown in individually housed (IH) rats. Because IH presents a social stressor that may create depressant-like effects in control animals, this study sought to compare the effects of chronic caffeine in IH and pair-housed (PH) adolescent male and female rats. Housing conditions began on postnatal day 24 (P24) and half of the rats were provided caffeine (0.25 g/l) in their drinking water beginning on P28. Open-field behavior was assessed on P42, a light/dark test was conducted on P43, and a forced swim test was conducted on P44-P45. PH and caffeine separately increased behavior in the open-field test and females reared more than males. In the light/dark test, IH animals and males showed greater anxiety-like behavior than PH animals and females, respectively. In the forced swim test, PH animals showed less overall immobility and caffeine decreased immobility in IH rats and PH females but increased immobility in PH males. Swimming behavior was higher in PH rats overall and caffeine increased swimming in IH rats but decreased swimming in PH rats. Climbing behavior was increased by caffeine in all groups except PH males with the greatest increase in PH females. We conclude that the effects of caffeine on depressive-like and anxiety-like behavior in adolescents are dependent on sex and housing conditions.

AB  - The multifactorial etiology of stress-related disorders necessitates a constant interrogation of the molecular convergences in preclinical models of stress that use disparate paradigms as stressors spanning from environmental challenges to genetic predisposition to hormonal signaling. Using RNA-sequencing, we investigated the genomic signatures in the ventral hippocampus common to mouse models of stress. Chronic oral corticosterone (CORT) induced increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in wild-type male mice and male mice heterozygous for the gene coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met, a variant associated with genetic susceptibility to stress. In a separate set of male mice, chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) led to a susceptible or a resilient population, whose proportion was dependent on housing conditions, namely standard housing or enriched environment. Rank-rank-hypergeometric overlap (RRHO), a threshold-free approach that ranks genes by their p value and effect size direction, was used to identify genes from a continuous gradient of significancy that were concordant across groups. In mice treated with CORT and in standard-housed susceptible mice, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were concordant for gene networks involved in neurotransmission, cytoskeleton function, and vascularization. Weighted gene co-expression analysis generated 54 gene hub modules and revealed two modules in which both CORT and CSDS-induced enrichment in DEGs, whose function was concordant with the RRHO predictions, and correlated with behavioral resilience or susceptibility. These data showed transcriptional concordance across models in which the stress coping depends upon hormonal, environmental, or genetic factors revealing common genomic drivers that embody the multifaceted nature of stress-related disorders.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene which results in progressive neurodegeneration in the striatum, cortex, and eventually most brain areas. Despite being a monogenic disorder, environmental factors influence HD characteristics. Both human and mouse studies suggest that mutant HTT (mHTT) leads to gene expression changes that harbor potential to be modulated by the environment. Yet, the underlying mechanisms integrating environmental cues into the gene regulatory program have remained largely unclear. To better understand gene-environment interactions in the context of mHTT, we employed RNA-seq to examine effects of maternal separation (MS) and environmental enrichment (EE) on striatal gene expression during development of BACHD rats. We integrated our results with striatal consensus modules defined on HTT-CAG length and age-dependent co-expression gene networks to relate the environmental factors with disease progression. While mHTT was the main determinant of expression changes, both MS and EE were capable of modulating these disturbances, resulting in distinctive and in several cases opposing effects of MS and EE on consensus modules. This bivalent response to maternal separation and environmental enrichment may aid in explaining their distinct effects observed on disease phenotypes in animal models of HD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the stimulation and inhibition of the ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex (infralimbic cortex) on basal and stress-induced plasma levels of corticosterone and on the acquisition of aversive memory in animals maintained in control and environmental enrichment (EE) conditions. Intracortical microinjections of the GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin and agonist muscimol were performed in male Wistar rats to stimulate and inhibit, respectively, the activity of the infralimbic cortex. Injections were performed 60 min before foot shock stress and training in the inhibitory avoidance task. Picrotoxin injections into the infralimbic cortex increased basal plasma levels of corticosterone. These increases were higher in EE rats which suggest that EE enhances the control exerted by infralimbic cortex over the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and corticosterone release. Muscimol injections into the infralimbic cortex reduced the stress-induced plasma levels of corticosterone and the retention latency 24 h after training in the inhibitory avoidance performance in control and EE animals, respectively. These results further suggest that the infralimbic cortex is required for the activation of the HPA axis during stress and for the acquisition of contextual aversive memories. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Potentiating social, cognitive, and sensorimotor stimulations the Environmental Enrichment (EE) increases levels of novelty and complexity experienced by individuals. Growing evidence demonstrates that parental EE experience, even occurring in the pre-reproductive phase, affects behavioral and neural developmental trajectories of the offspring.
   To discover how the accumulation of early maternal complex experiences may inform and shape the social behavior of the following generation, we examined the effects of pre-reproductive enrichment of dams (post-natal days 21-72) on the play performances of their male and female adolescent offspring. Furthermore, we examined the effects of pre-reproductive enrichment on maternal behavior (during post-partum days 1-10) and male intruder aggression (on post-partum day 11). Since oxytocin modulates maternal care, social bonding, and agonistic behavior, the number of oxytocinergic neurons of the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei was examined in both dams and offspring.
   Results revealed that enriched females exhibited higher levels of pup-oriented behaviors, especially Crouching, and initiated pup-retrieval more quickly than standard females after the maternal aggression test. Such behavioral peculiarities were accompanied by increased levels of oxytocinergic neurons in PVN and SON. Moreover, pre-reproductive maternal EE cross-generationally influenced the offspring according to sex. Indeed, male pups born to enriched females exhibited a reduced play fighting associated with a higher number of oxytocinergic neurons in SON in comparison to male pups born to standard housed females.
   In conclusion, pre-reproductive EE to the mothers affects their maternal care and has a cross-generational impact on the social behavior of their offspring that do not directly experiences EE.

AB  - Domestic dogs are often kept in kennelled environments. These may be stressful, and impact negatively upon welfare, due to unpredictable variations in space, social interaction and noise. Auditory stimulation such as music has been demonstrated to enhance animal welfare in a range of species, however despite suggested benefits in humans the potential of audiobooks as auditory enrichment for animals has not been investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of audiobooks upon the behaviour of 31 dogs housed in a rescue shelter. The dogs were exposed to five auditory conditions (audiobook, classical music, pop music, psychoacoustically designed dog music and no auditory control) for 2 h with an intervening period of 2 days between conditions. The dogs' behaviour were recorded every 5 min throughout the 2 h auditory conditions using instantaneous scan-sampling. The findings from the present study indicate that exposure to audiobooks significantly influences the behaviour of kennelled dogs. Audiobooks resulted in dogs spending more of their time resting than when exposed to any of the other auditory conditions (Control: Z=-4.807, P<0.001; Pop: Z=-4.791, P<0.001; Classical: Z=-4.732, P<0.001; Psychoacoustically designed dog music: Z=-3.911, P<0.001). Dogs also spent less time displaying sitting or standing vigilant behaviour when the audiobook was played compared to all other conditions (Control: Z=-4.579, P<0.001; Pop: Z=-4.504, P<0.001; Classical: Z=-3.450, P=0.001; psychoacoustically designed dog music: Z=-3.514, P<0.001). This study suggests that exposure to audiobooks can enhance the welfare of kennelled dogs due to their calming influence on dog behaviour. Use of audiobooks provides a simple yet practical tool that can be readily used in many kennel environments to enhance dog welfare and potentially increase the likelihood of successful rehoming of dogs.

AB  - Background: People exposed to prolonged chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) are easy to suffer from depression and cognitive impairment. Environmental enrichment (EE) had a beneficial effect on depressive-like and cognition-like behaviors by inhibiting inflammation. However, the specific mechanism involved in the inflammation inhibition that occurs after EE treatment for the depression and cognitive decline induced by CUMS remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the possible mechanism of the beneficial effects on depression and cognition by EE. Methods: Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups as follows: (1) Control + standard environment (SE), (2) CUMS + SE, (3) CUMS + EE, (4) CUMS + EE+ 3-methiladenine (3-MA), (5) CUMS + SE + 3-MA. They were exposed to CUMS procedure for 5 weeks except the control group. After CUMS procedure, rats were housed in the EE or SE for 3 weeks. During EE or SE treatment, rats were injected with normal saline or 3-MA every day. 3-MA as an autophagy inhibitor suppresses autophagy via inhibition of class III PI3K. Behavioral tests were used to investigate depressive-like and cognition-like behaviors after EE treatment. Then, autophagy-related proteins, inflammation-related molecules, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluoresence were determined. Results: We found that CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, reflected in worse behavioral test, such as reduced sucrose preference ratio, decreased locomotor and exploratory activity, pro-longed immobility and spatial learning and memory impairment. In addition, CUMS rats exhibited the reduced expression of autophagy related proteins including LC3 and Beclin-1 and the increased inflammation activation including microglia cells, NLRP3 inflammasome and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-18, IL-6 and TNF-alpha). After EE treatment, these changes were reversed. However, 3-MA, the inhibitor of autophagy, eliminated the neuro-protective effects of EE on depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that EE can play neuroprotective effects on depression and cognitive impairment by inducing autophagy-mediated inflammation inhibition, which accounts for the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-18, IL-6 and TNF-alpha.

AB  - Cognitive enrichment, a special form of environmental enrichment, addresses the cognitive abilities of animals in captivity. Through cognitive interaction with the environment, the animals regain a certain control over their environment, and essential resources, such as food or water, act as a reward for successful coping. It is assumed that this process has important implications for animal welfare, especially in the intensive housing systems of farm animals. This study investigates the effects of cognitive enrichment on welfare-relevant behaviour (agonistic interactions and behavioural reactivity in a repeated open-field test) and autonomic control (heart rate variability during feeding, resting and in a repeated open-field test) in domestic pigs. A total of forty-eight pigs, Sus scrofa, were housed in groups of four. In six replicates, an experimental group was compared with a conventionally fed control group. The pigs in the experimental group were confronted with a cognitive challenge that was integrated into their familiar housing environment. Pigs were rewarded with food after they successfully mastered the discrimination of an individual acoustical signal followed by an operant task. The pigs in both groups reacted with sympathetic arousal to feeding announcement (increased heart rate (HR)). During feeding, the experimental pigs' HR decreased, and heart rate variability (HRV) increased, while the control pigs' HR stayed highly elevated and HRV decreased. These results are supported by a considerably larger number of agonistic interactions during feeding in the control group. During resting, the basal HRV of the experimental pigs increased (during operant conditioning) compared to the control. In the repeated open-field test, the experimental pigs displayed less locomotion and elimination as well as more contact with the wall and an unknown object compared to the control group. We conclude that cognitive enrichment leads to relaxed feeding and evokes longer lasting positive emotions. Moreover, the pigs displayed more explorative and less fearful behaviour in stressful situations. These findings support the use of cognitive enrichment to improve animal welfare.

AB  - The present Study aimed to measure anticipatory activity in farmed mink (Mustela vison) to study the effects of the presence of environmental enrichments in three housing systems differing in cage structure and in the amount of enrichments. In studies on laboratory rats, anticipatory activity is used as a parameter for potentially stressful conditions of different housing systems: enriched housed rats were less sensitive to sucrose-rewards than standard housed rats as shown by a lower anticipatory reactivity suggesting less stressful conditions.
   Anticipatory activity in 36 adult female mink was elicited in a Pavlovian paradigm with tasty cat food as reward in January 2002. This Pavlovian paradigm was followed by an observation of stereotypical behaviour in February 2002. The Pavlovian paradigm and the observations of stereotypical behaviour were preceded by observations on juvenile mink behaviour (7-11 weeks of age) in the Summer of 2001.
   The results of this study show (1) that mink juveniles in the most enriched system had more variable behaviour suggesting better coping potentials and (2) that mink, just like rats, can be trained to anticipate on reward. However, in contrast to the behavioural results of the juveniles, no significant long-term effects of the additional enrichments were found as measured by anticipatory activity and stereotypical behaviour, suggesting no differences between the experimental housing systems in terms of stress.

AB  - Rearing young rodents in socially isolated or environmentally enriched conditions has been shown to affect numerous components of the dopamine system as well as behavior. Methylphenidate (MPH), a commonly used dopaminergic agent, may affect animals differently based on rearing environment. Here we examined the interaction between environment and chronic MPH treatment at clinically relevant doses, administered via osmotic minipump. Young Sprague Dawley rats (PND 21) were assigned to environmentally enriched, pair-housed, or socially isolated rearing conditions, and treated with either 0, 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day MPH for 3 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, animals were tested for locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior. The densities of D1-like and D2-like receptors were measured in the striatum using in vitro receptor autoradiography. Locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior were increased in isolated animals compared to pair-housed and enriched animals. The density of D1-like receptors was greater in isolated animals, but there were no differences between groups in D2-like receptor density. Finally, there were no effects of MPH administration on any reported measure. This study provides evidence for an effect of early rearing environment on the dopamine system and behavior, and also suggests that MPH administration may not have long-term consequences.

AB  - The Psittaciformes are a large order of landbirds comprising over 350 species in about 83 genera. In 2009, 141 published studies implicated parrots as research subjects; in 31 of these studies, 483 individuals from 45 different species could be considered laboratory animals. Amazons and budgerigars were by far the most represented psittacine species. The laboratory research topics were categorized as either veterinary medicine and diagnostics (bacteriology, hematology, morphology, and reproduction; 45%) or behavioral and sensory studies (behavior, acoustics, and vision; 17%). Confinement of psittacine species for research purposes is a matter of concern as scientifically based species-specific housing guidelines are scarce. The aim of this article is to provide scientific information relevant to the laboratory confinement of Psittaciformes to promote the refinement of acquisition, housing, and maintenance practices of these birds as laboratory animals. We briefly discuss systematics, geographical distribution, legislation, and conservation status as background information on laboratory parrot confinement. The following section presents welfare concerns related to captive containment (including domestication status) and psittacine cognition. We then discuss considerations in the acquisition of laboratory parrots and review important management issues such as nutrition, zoonoses, housing, and environmental enrichment. The final section reviews indications of distress and compromised welfare.

AB  - Experience powerfully influences neuronal function and cognitive performance, but the cellular and molecular events underlying the experience-dependent enhancement of mental ability have remained elusive. In particular, the mechanisms that couple the external environment to the genomic changes underpinning this improvement are unknown. To address this, we have used male mice harboring an inactivating mutation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-activated enzyme downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that MSK1 is required for the full extent of experience-induced improvement of spatial memory, for the expansion of the dynamic range of synapses, exemplified by the enhancement of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), and for the regulation of the majority of genes influenced by enrichment. In addition, and unexpectedly, we show that experience is associated with an MSK1-dependent downregulation of key MAPK and plasticity-related genes, notably of EGR1/Zif268 and Arc/Arg3.1, suggesting the establishment of a novel genomic landscape adapted to experience. By coupling experience to homeostatic changes in gene expression MSK1, represents a prime mechanism through which the external environment has an enduring influence on gene expression, synaptic function, and cognition.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) after birth has been reported as an intervention improving the anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficit due to maternal restraint, foot-shock, or social stress during pregnancy. However, it remains unclear whether EE after birth could benefit the early prenatal undernourished offspring. In this study, we examined the effect of daily handling as a simple EE intervention on the aberrant behavior of prenatally undernourished rats. The male rat offspring exhibited anxiety-like behavior at 9 weeks of age due to maternal food restriction in early pregnancy. Our study shows that the daily handling after weaning has an anxiolytic effect in the prenatally undernourished offspring without affecting the behavior of prenatally well-nourished offspring. Conversely, the concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and their metabolites were not altered in the prefrontal cortex by prenatal undernutrition or daily handling after weaning. We investigated whether the anxiolytic effect of daily handling was mediated by the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway using the PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine. The anxiolytic effect of the handling was not canceled by chelerythrine injection in prenatally undernourished offspring, whereas chelerythrine induced an anxiety-like behavior in control rats. Our results suggest that maternal undernutrition in early pregnancy induces an anxiety-like behavior accompanied with a PKC pathway-hyporesponsiveness; however, daily handling ameliorates the anxiety-like behavior through a PKC-independent pathway.

AB  - Stress-related disorders are extremely complex and current treatment strategies have limitations. The present study investigated alternative pathological mechanisms using a combination of multiple environmental approaches with biochemical and molecular tools. The aim of the present study was to evaluate blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity in socially manipulated animal housing conditions. Multiple environmentally-related models were employed in the current study. The main model proposed (chronically isolated rats) was biochemically validated using the level of peripheral corticosterone. The current study examined and compared the mRNA levels of certain inflammatory and BBB markers in the hippocampal tissue of chronically isolated rats, including claudin-5 (cldn5) and tight junction protein (tjp). Animals were divided into four groups: i) Standard housed rats (controls); ii) chronically isolated rats; iii) control rats treated with fluoxetine, which is a standard selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; and iv) isolated rats treated with fluoxetine. To further examine the effect of environmental conditions on BBB markers, the current study assessed BBB markers in enriched environmental (EE) housing and short-term isolation conditions. The results demonstrated a significant increase in cldn5 and tjp levels in the chronically isolated group. Despite some anomalous results, alterations in mRNA levels were further confirmed in EE housing conditions compared with chronically isolated rats. This trend was also observed in rats subjected to short-term isolation compared with paired controls. Additionally, levels of IL-6, an inflammatory marker associated with neuroinflammation, were markedly increased in the isolated group. However, treatment with fluoxetine treatment reversed these effects. The results indicated that BBB integrity may be compromised in stress-related disorders, highlighting a need for further functional studies on the kinetics of BBB in stress-related models.

AB  - The mechanistic understanding of lifestyle contributions to disease has been largely driven by work in laboratory rodent models using environmental interventions. These interventions show an array of methodologies and sometimes unclear collective conclusions, hampering clinical interpretations. Here we discuss environmental enrichment, exercise and stress interventions to illustrate how different protocols can affect the interpretations of environmental factors in disease. We use Huntington's disease (HD) as an example because its mouse models exhibit excellent validity and HD was the first genetic animal model in which environmental stimulation was found to be beneficial. We make a number of observations and recommendations. Firstly, environmental enrichment and voluntary exercise generally show benefits across laboratories and mouse models. However, the extent to which these environmental interventions have beneficial effects depends on parameters such as the structural complexity of the cage in the case of enrichment, the timing of the intervention and the nature of the control conditions. In particular, clinical interpretations should consider deprived control living conditions and the ethological relevance of the enrichment. Secondly, stress can have negative effects on the phenotype in mouse models of HD and other brain disorders. When modeling stress, the effects of more than one type of experimental stressor should be investigated due to the heterogeneity and complexity of stress responses. With stress in particular, but ideally in all studies, both sexes should be used and the randomized group sizes need to be sufficiently powered to detect any sex effects. Opportunities for clinical translation will be guided by the 'environmental construct validity' of the preclinical data, including the culmination of complementary protocols across multiple animal models. Environmental interventions in mouse models of HD provide illustrative examples of how valid preclinical studies can lead to conclusions relevant to clinical populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several studies have shown that manipulations to the housing environment modulate susceptibility to stress in laboratory animals, mainly in rodents. Environmental enrichment (EE) is one such manipulation that promotes neuroprotection and neurogenesis, besides affecting behaviors such as drug self-administration. Zebrafish are a popular and useful animal model for behavioral neuroscience studies; however, studies evaluating the impact of housing conditions in this species are scarce. In this study, we verified the effects of EE on behavioral (novel tank test) and biochemical [ cortisol and reactive oxygen species (ROS)] parameters in zebrafish submitted to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). Consistent with our previous findings, UCS increased anxiety-like behavior, cortisol and ROS levels in zebrafish. EE for 21 or 28 days attenuated the effects induced by UCS on behavior and cortisol, and prevented the effects on ROS levels. Our findings reinforce the idea that EE exerts neuromodulatory effects across species, reducing vulnerability to stress and its biochemical impact. Also, these results indicate that zebrafish is a suitable model animal to study the behavioral effects and neurobiological mechanisms related to EE.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been studied as a protocol that can improve brain plasticity and may protect against negative insults such as chronic stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of EE on the hormonal and behavioral responses induced by chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMS) in rats, considering the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system. Male adult rats were divided into 4 groups: control, CMS, EE, and CMS + EE, and the experimental protocol lasted for 7 weeks. EE was performed during 7 weeks, 5 days per week, 2 h per day. CMS was applied during weeks 3, 4, and 5. After the CMS (week 6), depression-like behavior was evaluated by forced swimming and sucrose consumption tests, anxiety level was evaluated using the elevated plus-maze test, and memory was evaluated using the Y-maze test. On week 7, the animals were euthanized and basal plasma levels of corticosterone and catecholamines were determined. The hypothalamus was isolated and tissue levels of angiotensin peptides were evaluated. CMS increased plasma corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine basal concentrations, induced depression-like behaviors, impaired memory, and increased hypothalamic angiotensin I, II, and IV concentrations. EE decreased stress hormones secretion, depression-like behaviors, memory impairment, and hypothalamic angiotensin II induced by stress. Reductions of anxiety-like behavior and norepinephrine secretion were observed in both stressed and unstressed groups. The results indicated that EE seemed to protect adult rats against hormonal and behavioral CMS effects, and that the reduction of angiotensin II could contribute to these effects.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been a widely used tool to improve animal welfare, as well as to study brain plasticity. Traditional EE settings in the field of neuroscience employ highly complex cages with numerous objects and increased space, whereas more simple additions included for the control treatment are rarely considered in the experimental design. This leads to a lack of consistency of what neuroscientists designate as "standard housing," which might compromise the reproducibility of the results. Therefore, we employed standard-sized cages to study how different EE configurations can affect several biological markers of animal welfare. We first compared barren cages with cages containing nest material and a cardboard roll or cages having a complex set of elements. For this purpose, we studied anxiety-like behavior, corticosterone metabolites in feces, and cell survival in the hippocampus. Complex enrichment (CE) increased the concentration of corticosterone metabolites while also decreasing anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, both simple and CEs were able to promote cell survival in the hippocampus, and this measure was positively correlated to corticosterone metabolites. Furthermore, in a second experiment, one of the elements of the CE was able to reduce anxiety-like behavior and blood glucose reactivity after exposure to a stressful situation. Altogether, this study calls attention about how sensitive experimental outcomes are to these simple EE elements. Even though EE is recommended by most guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, a detailed analysis of the EE protocol that is going to be implemented is highly encouraged.

AB  - Rats reared in social isolation exhibit a syndrome of behavioral and biochemical effects indicative of enhanced mesolimbic dopamine (DA) function. The precise nature of the neurodevelopmental changes that produce this state are unknown but result in enhanced DA neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAC). It was hypothesized that this may be the indirect result of chronic changes in glutamate NMDA receptor function. The same prediction has been made for Fawn hooded (FH) rats that exhibit some of the characteristic effects of isolation-reared rats when compared to Wistar rats. Therefore, mRNA levels of the NMDAR1A receptor subunit were determined by in situ hybridization and were quantified in the striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of FH and Wistar rats. Isolation rearing alone was not found to have an effect on the expression of NMDAR1A, while FH rats had reduced levels across most brain regions examined. In some areas of the striatum and prefrontal cortex, this effect was greater in FH isolates than in FH socials, while in the hippocampus, the opposite was observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a widely used treatment for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Recently, several studies have used preclinical animal models to suggest that DBS has a potential to improve emotional symptoms in mental disorders such as treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. An important difference between neurodegenerative and emotional disorders is the crucial role of environment in the ontogeny of the latter. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of DBS in the context of environmental variation. In this study, we show that DBS of ventromedial prefrontal cortex reduces anxiety in rats when it is coupled with simultaneous exposure to an enriched environment (EE). In contrast, effects of DBS on anxiety-like behaviors remained equivocal when animals were housed in standard laboratory conditions. These results suggest that the ability of DBS to treat anxiety and related phenotypes can be significantly enhanced by EE opportunities.

AB  - Rationale Early-life environment influences reinforcer and drug motivation in adulthood; however, the impact on specific components of motivation, including hedonic value ("liking"), remains unknown. Objectives The current study determined whether differential rearing alters liking and aversive responding to ethanol, sucrose, and quinine in an ethanol-naive rat model. Methods Male and female rats were reared for 30 days starting at postnatal day 21 in either an enriched (EC), isolated (IC), or standard condition (SC). Thereafter, all rats had indwelling intraoral fistulae implanted and their taste reactivity to water, ethanol (5, 10, 20, 30, 40% v/v), sucrose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 M), and quinine (0.1, 0.5 mM) was recorded and analyzed. Results EC rats had higher amounts of liking responses to ethanol, sucrose, and quinine and higher amounts of aversive responses to ethanol and quinine compared to IC rats. While EC and IC rats' responses were different from each other, they both tended to be similar to SCs, who fell in between the EC and IC groups. Conclusions These results suggest that environmental enrichment may enhance sensitivity to a variety of tastants, thereby enhancing liking, while isolation may dull sensitivity, thereby dulling liking. Altogether, the evidence suggests that isolated rats have a shift in the allostatic set-point which may, in part, drive increased responding for a variety of rewards including ethanol and sucrose. Enriched rats have enhanced liking of both sucrose and ethanol suggesting that enrichment may offer a unique phenotype with divergent preferences for incentive motivation.

AB  - The pre- and post-natal periods are characterized by unrivalled growth and are sensitive to environmental changes. A correctly stimulating early environment is essential for developing natural behaviors and maintaining affective wellness. Five litters of rat progeny were co-housed through gestation until juvenile age in housing providing physical and social enrichment. Five control litters were housed separately in standard conditions. Half of the offspring were tested in the elevated plus-maze and the social interaction test as juveniles (five weeks old) with the other half tested in the Morris water maze. As adults (11 weeks old), the testing groups were reversed. Weight was monitored weekly. Enriched offspring had leaner body weights. In the elevated plus-maze, control juvenile progeny spent a higher percentage of time in the open arms, showed greater locomotor activity, less grooming, and more rearing (males only). In the social interaction test, enriched juvenile offspring were found to sniff their conspecific more, display more self-grooming behaviour as well as show less locomotor activity and body contact. In the Morris water maze probe test, enriched rats demonstrated improved memory for the platform position and more effective search strategies with increased platform crossings, middle crossing as well as more time spent in the platform quadrant and less thigmotaxis behaviour. Adult female rat offspring also demonstrated superior memory for the platform position and crossed the maze middle more often. These results suggest that combined pre- and post-natal environmental enrichment influences physiology and behaviour in offspring rats with some of those influences being long-lasting.

AB  - Validated measures of animal affect are crucial to research spanning numerous disciplines. Judgement bias, which assesses decision-making under ambiguity, is a promising measure of animal affect. One way of validating this measure is to administer drugs with affect-altering properties in humans to non-human animals and determine whether the predicted judgement biases are observed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using data from 20 published research articles that use this approach, from which 557 effect sizes were extracted. Pharmacological manipulations overall altered judgement bias at the probe cues as predicted. However, there were several moderating factors including the neurobiological target of the drug, whether the drug induced a relatively positive or negative affective state in humans, dosage, and the presented cue. This may partially reflect interference from adverse effects of the drug which should be considered when interpreting results. Thus, the overall pattern of change in animal judgement bias appears to reflect the affect-altering properties of drugs in humans, and hence may be a valuable measure of animal affective valence.

AB  - Chronic pain (CP) adversely impacts people's health. However, the influence of CP on pregnant women and their fetuses remains unclear. Few reasonable interventions have been offered to these women. This study aimed to examine the effects of enriched environmental intervention (EEI) on the delivery outcome and offspring health of pregnant mice with CP. Forty pregnant mice were equally and randomly divided into four groups (control, sham, CP, and CP + EEI). Monoarthritis was induced by subcutaneous injection of the complete Freund's adjuvant (100 g/100 l) into the left hind paw of mice on Day 0 of gestation. Sham mice received 100 mu l of sterile phosphate-buffered saline subcutaneously. General health status and delivery outcomes of pregnant mice and general physical status, growth, and development of offspring were observed and compared between groups. CP mice exhibited less weight gain, higher rate of premature delivery, smaller litter size, lower live birth rate, lower filial birth weight, shorter filial tail length, and lower filial rates of achieving righting reflex and crawling compared to mice in the control/sham/CP + EEI groups. There were no significant differences between mice in the CP + EEI group and those in the control and sham groups. CP during pregnancy led to serious adverse impacts on both the mother and fetus mice in this study, and EEI was an effective treatment for these effects.

AB  - Exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients relieves symptoms caused by fear association as well as symptoms that are not the result of associative learning. We used the inescapable foot shock model (IFS), an animal model for PTSD, to study the possible involvement of glutamate receptors, the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system, and the neuropeptide V (NPY) system in the reduction of stress sensitization following repeated re-exposure to the conditioning context. Starting one week after the IFS procedure, the rats were repeatedly re-exposed to the shock environment. Stress sensitivity was measured in a modified open field test (sudden silence was used as a stressor). Selected mRNAs (GluN1, -2A-C, GluA1-4, GluK1-5, CRF, CRF-R1, NPY, NPY-Y1) were quantified in the amygdala.
   Repeated re-exposure (RE) to the IFS context reduced both trauma-associated anxiety (to the IFS context) and the enhanced stress sensitivity (in the open field). Changes in glutamate receptor subunits (GluN1, GluN2A-B, GluA1, GluA4, GluK3, GluK4) were detected in the amygdala that were normalized by RE. However, infusion of the AMPA/kainate antagonist NBQX in the BLA (basolateral amygdala) did not improve the anxious behavior. RE normalized IFS-induced increases in CRF-R1 mRNA and increased NPY-Y1 mRNA expression in the amygdala. Previously, and repeated here, we showed that environmental enrichment (EE) enhances recovery from IFS. EE led to similar changes in CRF-R1 and NPY-Y1 expression as RE did. Importantly, administration of [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY (Y1 agonist) in the BLA normalized the enhanced sensitivity to stress after IFS.
   Our data suggest that the NPY-Y1 receptor in the amygdala may serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of PTSD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The single housing of laboratory rats may be recommended in some situations such as hypothesis-driven or test-specific studies, during electroencephalogram recording of phases of sleep and after surgical procedures. However, as single housing of laboratory rats has been shown to be stressful, modification of the housing environment is needed to improve the welfare of these animals. This experiment was carried out to investigate the long-term effects of environmental enrichment on some behavioural, physiological, pathological and psychological measures of welfare. With two batches of animals, 24 rats were housed singly in either enriched cages (EC) (n = 12 cages) or unenriched cages (UC) (n = 12 cages). Behaviour was sampled every week and so was body weight and weight gain over a six-week observation period. Behaviours of the rats in the elevated plus-maze were recorded on the seventh week, whereas organ weights were recorded postmortem. The results revealed that long-term single housing of rats in super-enriched cages increased levels of indicators of good welfare including sleep, exploration, movement and feeding behaviour, body weights, weight gains and the relative weights of the thymus gland and spleen, and decreased levels of indicators of poor welfare such as stationary behaviour and the relative weight of adrenal glands. Thus, enrichment of conventional cages of newly weaned singly-housed laboratory rats with multiple physical structures appeared to improve their ability to control the environment and to promote their species-specific behaviour; changes that can ultimately result in good welfare.

AB  - Maternal separation during early childhood results in greater sensitivity to stressors later in adult life. This is reflected as greater propensity to develop stress-related disorders in humans and animal models, including anxiety and depression. Environmental enrichment (EE) reverses some of the damaging effects of maternal separation in rodent models when provided during peripubescent life, temporally proximal to the separation. It is presently unknown if EE provided outside this critical window can still rescue separation-induced anxiety and neural plasticity. In this report we use a rat model to demonstrate that a single short episode of EE in adulthood reduced anxiety-like behaviour in maternally separated rats. We further show that maternal separation resulted in hypertrophy of dendrites and increase in spine density of basolateral amygdala neurons in adulthood, long after initial stress treatment. This is congruent with prior observations showing centrality of basolateral amygdala hypertrophy in anxiety induced by stress during adulthood. In line with the ability of the adult enrichment to rescue stress-induced anxiety, we show that enrichment renormalized stress-induced structural expansion of the amygdala neurons. These observations argue that behavioural plasticity induced by early adversity can be rescued by environmental interventions much later in life, likely mediated by ameliorating effects of enrichment on basolateral amygdala plasticity.

AB  - The known effects of aging on the brain and behavior include impaired cognition, increases in anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, and reduced locomotor activity. Environmental exposures and interventions also influence brain functions during aging. We investigated the effects of normal aging under controlled environmental conditions and in the absence of external interventions on locomotor activity, cognition, anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, immune function and hippocampal gene expression in C57BL/6 mice. Healthy mice at 4, 9, and 14 months of age underwent behavioral testing using an established behavioral battery, followed by cellular and molecular analysis using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative PCR. We found that 14-month-old mice showed significantly reduced baseline locomotion, increased anxiety, and impaired spatial memory compared to younger counterparts. However, no significant differences were observed for depressive-like behavior in the forced-swim test. Microglia numbers in the dentate gyrus, as well as CD8+ memory T cells increased towards late middle age. Aging processes exerted a significant effect on the expression of 43 genes of interest in the hippocampus. We conclude that aging is associated with specific changes in locomotor activity, cognition, anxiety-like behaviors, neuroimmune responses and hippocampal gene expression.

AB  - The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is one of the most important modulators of neural circuitry and has a critical role in neural development and functions. Previous studies indicated that changes in serotonergic system signaling in early life critically impact mental health, behavior, the morphology of hippocampal neurons, and cognitive functions across the lifespan. The enriched environment (EE) has indicated beneficial effects on behavior and cognitive functions in the developmental period of life, but its impacts on cognitive impairments and behavioral changes following postnatal serotonin depletion are unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the influences of the EE housing (postnatal days [PNDs] 21-60) following postnatal serotonin depletion (by para-chlorophenylalanine [PCPA], 100 mg/kg, s.c, in PNDs 10-20) on anxiety-related behaviors, cognitive functions, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in the hippocampus of male rats. Memory and behavioral parameters were examined in early adulthood and after that, the hippocampi of rats were removed to determine the BDNF mRNA expression by PCR (PNDs 60-70). The findings of the present work indicated that adolescent EE exposure alleviated memory impairment, decreased BDNF levels, and anxiety disorders induced by experimental depletion of serotonin. Overall, these results indicate that serotonergic system dysregulation during the developmental periods can be alleviated by adolescent EE exposure.

AB  - With increasing rates of anxiety and mood disorders across the world, there is an unprecedented need for preclinical animal models to generate translational results for humans experiencing disruptive emotional symptoms. Considering that life events resulting in a perception of loss are correlated with depressive symptoms, the enrichment-loss rodent model offers promise as a translational model for stress-initiated psychiatric disorders. Additionally, predisposed temperament characteristics such as coping styles have been found to influence an individual's stress response. Accordingly, male rats were profiled as either consistent or flexible copers and assigned to one of three environments: standard laboratory housing, enriched environment, or enriched environment exposure followed by downsizing to standard laboratory cages (i.e., enrichment-loss group). Throughout the study, several behaviors were assessed to determine stress, social, and reward-processing responses. To assess recovery of the stress response, fecal samples were collected following the swim stress in 3-h increments to determine the recovery trajectory of corticosterone (CORT) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) metabolite levels. Upon death, neural markers of neuroplasticity including doublecortin, glial fibrillary acidic factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were assessed via immunohistochemistry. Results indicated the flexible coping animals in the continuous enriched group had higher DHEA/CORT ratios (consistent with adaptive responses in past research); furthermore, the enrichment-loss animals exhibited a blunted CORT response throughout the assessments and enriched flexible copers had faster CORT recovery rates than consistent copers. Standard housed animals exhibited less exploratory behavior in the open field task and continuous enriched, flexible rats consumed more food rewards than the other groups. No differences in neuroplasticity neural markers were observed. In sum, the results of the present study support past research indicating the disruptive consequences of enrichment-loss, providing evidence that the model represents a valuable approach for the investigation of neurobiological mechanisms contributing to interindividual variability in responses to changing experiential landscapes.

AB  - In the present work the effects of movement restriction imposed during the early postweaning period on both Purkinje cell dendritic development and exploratory behavior were analyzed. Male and female Sprague-Dawley albino rats were reared either in isolated-restricted or social-standard environments from postnatal day 18 to 30. On the 31st postnatal day, all rats were behaviorally evaluated by the open-field test and then sacrificed under deep ether anesthesia. Vermian cerebellar sections were later stained with the Golgi-Cox-Sholl method and the Purkinje cell dendritic morphology was quantified under light microscopy. The results indicate that early somatomotor restriction severely impairs both exploratory behavior and Purkinje cell dendritic growth.

AB  - We investigated effects of early and later life housing on attention bias, as an indicator of affective state, in pigs differing in coping style [reactive (LR) vs. proactive (HR)]. Pigs (n=128) in barren or enriched housing from birth (B1 vs. E1) that experienced either a switch in housing at 7 weeks of age or not (creating B1B2, B1E2, E1E2, and E1B2 treatments), were studied in a 180-s attention bias test at 11 weeks. Pigs exposed to a 10-s-auditory-and-sudden-motion threat in the test arena paid more attention to the location of the threat, were more vigilant, showed less eating, more walking and were more likely to utter high-pitched vocalisations than non-threat pigs. During threat presence, HR pigs from post-switch enriched housing (E2-HR, i.e., B1E2+E1E2) showed more vigilance but less exploration than others. After threat removal, no effects were found on time spent paying attention to the threat, vigilance, and eating, but E2-HR pigs paid attention to the threat more frequently, were more likely to utter high-pitched vocalisations and walked more compared to (part of) other groups, suggesting the most negative affective state in these animals. E2 pigs grunted more than B2 pigs. Thus, current housing, but not early life housing, affected behaviour in a personality-dependent manner in this attention bias test. Housing effects were opposite to expectation, possibly due to the short-term effect of the relative contrast between the home pens of the pigs and the test room. This potentially overruled putative long-term effects of environmental conditions on attention bias.

AB  - The authors investigated the effects of fluvoxamine on neurochemical changes in the hippocampus elicited by isolation housing and novelty stress. Male F344 rats (11 w) were housed one per cage for four weeks. On each day of the last week (7 days) they were s.c. injected with fluvoxamine (20 mg/kg), and then subjected to novelty stress. Isolation housing significantly increased dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, whereas fluvoxamine significantly decreased them. Isolation housing significantly increased the DOPAC/DA ratio. Fluvoxamine significantly decreased the DA level, and partially restored the DOPAC and 5-HIAA levels increased by isolation housing.

AB  - The rescue of cognitive function through environmental enrichment (EE) during aging has been extensively documented. However, the age at onset, the duration of EE, and the cerebral mechanisms required to obtain the greatest benefits still remain to be determined. We have recently shown that EE applied for 3 mo after the median lifespan, i.e., the age at which 50% of the population is still alive (from 17 to 20 mo in NMRI mice), failed to prevent cognitive deficits in senescent animals. In the present study, mice were exposed to EE prior to the median lifespan, and for a longer total duration (from 14 to 20 mo), before the assessment of memory performance and the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neuronal networks. The EE prevented memory deficits and reduced anxiety as the animal aged. Moreover, EE attenuated the age-related impairment of basal glutamatergic neurotransmission in CA1 hippocampal slices, and reversed the decrease in isolated N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDA-R)-dependent synaptic potentials. Surprisingly, EE did not prevent the age-related alteration of theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation (LTP). This study therefore suggests that EE needs to be initiated before the age corresponding to the median lifespan and/or required long duration (> 3 mo) to have an effect on cognitive aging. In addition, we show that EE probably acts through theta-burst-independent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the concept that experience-dependent memory may be biased by affective state at the time of learning, the affective bias test represents a novel approach for the assessment of emotions in animals. The task uses a within-subjects study design, where animals encounter two independent discrimination tasks on separate test days and learn that digging in one out of two substrates is rewarded with food. While one pair of substrates is associated with an affective manipulation, the other functions as a neutral control. Potential affective biases are then quantified by a preference test in which both initially rewarded substrates are tested against each other. Since the test was originally developed for the work with rats, the aims of the present study were (1) to translate the paradigm from rats to mice, and (2) to investigate the impact of an environmental enrichment on affective state in male C57BL/6J mice. For this reason, two control groups were included in the study that served to validate the overall testing procedure. One control group experienced equal absolute reward values for both rewarded substrates, assuming that this would prevent a substrate preference. In the second control group, we tripled the reward for one substrate, hypothesizing that mice would bias their choice towards this higher rewarded substrate in the preference test. Indeed, animals of the first control group did not show any substrate preference, while subjects of the second control group preferred the substrate associated with the high reward. Thus, mice were able to learn the association between absolute reward value and respective substrate, indicating that the affective bias test has the potential to work in mice. Besides these control groups, a third group was implemented in the study: As for the first control group, the absolute reward value was the same for both rewarded substrates, but in addition to that, affective state at the time of learning was modified for one substrate by subjecting mice to a highly enriched cage directly after testing. Since enrichment is known to influence the behaviour and physiology of rodents mostly in a positive way, we expected to observe a preference for the substrate associated with the enriched cage. However, in contrast to our expectations, mice did not show any substrate preference, suggesting that the additional enrichment provided in the enriched cage was probably not sufficient to induce measurable changes in an affective state.

AB  - In standard cage (SC) raised mice, experience-dependent ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) rapidly declines with age: in postnatal day 25-35 (critical period) mice, 4 days of monocular deprivation (MD) are sufficient to induce OD-shifts towards the open eye; thereafter, 7 days of MD are needed. Beyond postnatal day 110, even 14 days of MD failed to induce OD-plasticity in mouse V1. In contrast, mice raised in a so-called "enriched environment" (EE), exhibit lifelong OD-plasticity. EE-mice have more voluntary physical exercise (running wheels), and experience more social interactions (bigger housing groups) and more cognitive stimulation (regularly changed labyrinths or toys). Whether experience-dependent shifts of V1-activation happen faster in EE-mice and how long the plasticity promoting effect would persist after transferring EE-mice back to SCs has not yet been investigated. To this end, we used intrinsic signal optical imaging to visualize V1-activation i) before and after MD in EE-mice of different age groups (from 1-9 months), and ii) after transferring mice back to SCs after postnatal day 130. Already after 2 days of MD, and thus much faster than in SC-mice, EE-mice of all tested age groups displayed a significant OD-shift towards the open eye. Transfer of EE-mice to SCs immediately abolished OD-plasticity: already after 1 week of SC-housing and MD, OD-shifts could no longer be visualized. In an attempt to rescue abolished OD-plasticity of these mice, we either administered the anti-depressant fluoxetine (in drinking water) or supplied a running wheel in the SCs. OD-plasticity was only rescued for the running wheel-mice. Altogether our results show that raising mice in less deprived environments like large EE-cages strongly accelerates experience-dependent changes in V1-activation compared to the impoverished SC-raising. Furthermore, preventing voluntary physical exercise of EE-mice in adulthood immediately precludes OD-shifts in V1.

AB  - Repetitive drug/ethanol (EtOH) binge-like consumption during pre-addictive stages favors a transition to addiction in vulnerable organisms. Experimental evidence points to the therapeutic and preventive effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on drug and EtOH addiction; however, little is known regarding EE modulation of binge-like consumption in non-dependent organisms. Here, we explore the impact of early EE on binge-like EtOH consumption: (1) we test whether early EE exposure prevents binge-like EtOH intake (20% v/v) in adult mice under an intermittent drinking in the dark (iDID) schedule; (2) we evaluate the therapeutic effects of EE housing conditions on binge-like EtOH consumption in adult animals; and (3) we compare novelty-seeking and compulsive-like behaviors, and anxiety-like behavior, as measured by the Hole Board (HB) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) tests, respectively, in adult EE/standard environment (SE) animals. Adolescent (postnatal day 28; PND28) mice were randomly allocated to two housing conditions (4 animals/cage): EE or SE. At PND67 all the animals were exposed to a schedule of EtOH binge-like iDID. On PND92 half of the animals in each environmental condition (EE and SE) were randomly allocated to two subgroups in a crossover design, where environmental conditions were kept similar to those previously experienced or switched, finally leading to four experimental conditions: EE-EE, EE-SE, SE-SE, and SE-EE. EtOH binge-like consumption continued until PND140, when EPM and HB tests were finally conducted. The main observations were: (1) EE-reared mice showed lower EtOH binge-like intake than SE-reared mice during adulthood, which supports a protective role for EE. (2) when adult EtOH drinking SE-reared mice were switched to EE conditions, a reduction in EtOH binge-like consumption was observed, suggesting a therapeutic role for EE; however, losing EE during adulthood triggered a progressive increase in EtOH binge-like intake. Moreover, (3) EE-housed adult animals with long-term exposure to EtOH binge-drinking showed lower anxietylike, compulsive-like, and novelty-seeking behaviors than SE-housed mice, irrespective of the specific housing conditions during adolescence. We discuss the primary impact of EE on anxiety-like neurobehavioral brain systems through which it secondarily modulates EtOH binge-like drinking.

AB  - Ts65Dn mouse is the most widely accepted model for Down syndrome. We previously showed that environmental enrichment improved spatial learning in female but deteriorated it in male Ts65Dn mice. This study analyzed the factors contributing to the disturbed cognition of male Ts65Dn mice after enriched housing, by allocating male control and Ts65Dn mice in four conditions after weaning: small (n = 2-3) and large group (n = 8-10) housing, and enriched housing in small (2-3) and large groups (8-10). Learning, aggressive behavior, anxiety-like behavior and biochemical correlates of stress were evaluated when Ts65Dn and control mice were 4-5 months old. Environmental enrichment in large mixed colonies of Ts65Dn and diploid littermates disturbed behavioral and learning skills of Ts65Dn mice in the Morris water maze. ACTH and testosterone levels were not modified in any group of mice. Ts65Dn and control mice subjected to enriched housing in large groups and Ts65Dn mice housed in large groups showed higher corticosterone levels. Aggressive behavior was evaluated by measuring the number of attacks performed in the presence of an intruder. Ts65Dn mice performed less attacks than controls in all conditions, especially after enriched housing, indicating subordination. In the plus maze, cognitive aspects (i.e. risk assessment) and motor components (open arm avoidance) of anxiety behavior were evaluated; no difference in any condition was found. It is suggested that an excess of social and/or physical stimulation in Ts65Dn mice may affect cognition by disturbing the emotional and behavioral components of the learning process.

AB  - Depression is a heterogeneous disorder displaying a range of symptoms including feelings of despair and social withdrawal. Social isolation may complicate the progression of depression and have effects on both behaviour and physiology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of social isolation on behavioural and metabolic parameters in a genetic rat model of depression, the Flinders Sensitive and Resistant Line (FSL/FRL) rats. Rats were housed either individually (social isolation) or pair-housed for 5 weeks, and subjected to behavioural testing and metabolic evaluation. We found that social isolation erased the characteristic difference in depressive-like behaviour, measured as immobility in the forced swim test, between the FSL and FRL rats. Social isolation affected both strains equally in impairing object recognition memory, while leading to an increased explorative behaviour in the elevated plus maze test. Surprisingly, single-housed FRL rats showed an increased food intake compared to pair-housed FRL rats, whereas no difference in food intake or body weight was evident in FSL rats. Our results indicate that social isolation for 5 weeks causes behavioural alterations, independent of strain. As the changes in appetite were only observed in the FRL rats, this may suggest that this strain responds to the stress of isolation by a change in feeding behaviour. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a constitutively active kinase that has been implicated in the mechanism of action of mood stabilizers. According to the neurogenic hypothesis of depression, newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus are required for the antidepressant effects of certain agents. We demonstrate that administration of the GSK-3 inhibitor VP2.51 (2.5 mg/kg ip, for 3.5 weeks) increases cell proliferation (pH3(+) cells), as well as the short-and long-term survival of newborn neurons (assessed by the 24 h survival of BrdU(+) and DCX+ neurons), while significantly increasing the commitment of cells to the granule neuron lineage (Prox1 immunoreactivity). In parallel, VP2.51 induces a net antidepressant effect, as judged by the decrease in the immobility time in the forced swim test of naive mice (non stressed mice), as well as a therapeutic effect on previously stressed mice (Porsolt-induced stress). Interestingly, the morphological changes were found prominently in the ventral region of the hippo campus. We found that these effects are neurogenesis dependent by combining the antimitotic temozolomide (50 mg/kg ip) with the drug. Importantly VP2.51 did not provoke changes in weight or in a battery of behavioral tests (learning/memory and activity tests). As the effects of VP2.51 were concomitant with the increase in beta-catenin expression and a shift towards the inactive form of GSK-3, we suggest that VP2.51 has therapeutic benefits following stress, and it may be a preventive treatment in situations where a potential depressive state and/or loss of memory is associated with diminished neurogenesis, through selective GSK3-beta inhibition.

AB  - While Huntington disease (HD) is caused solely by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin gene, environmental factors can influence HD onset and progression. Here, we review studies linking environment and HD in both humans and animal models. In HD patients, we find that: (i) an active lifestyle associates with both a delayed age at onset of HD and a decreased severity of symptoms, (ii) applying physical exercise and behavioral therapies in small cohorts of HD subjects indicate promising effects on the HD symptomatology, (iii) Mediterranean diet correlates with lower motor impairment, and treatments based on omega-3 fatty acids improve motor function , whereas (iv) increased cortisol levels associate with specific HD symptoms. In animal models, in line with the evidence in humans, physical exercise, environmental enrichment and different types of dietary intervention ameliorate or delay several HD phenotypes. In contrast, stress appears to be involved in the HD pathogenesis, and HD mice present increased stress sensitivity. Importantly, studies in animal models have uncovered several molecular factors mediating environmental effects on HD associated neuropathology. However, the influence of the environment on several key HD mechanisms as well as the underlying regulatory factors remain to be explored. Given the role of epigenetic factors and modifications in the interplay between environment and genes, the exploration of their role as mechanisms underlying the environmental action in HD is a promising avenue for both our fundamental understanding of the disease and as a potential for therapy.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the implementation of an environmental enrichment (EE) plan on reproductive performance in mice, applied during one year period in Swiss Webster breeders and their female offspring used as recipients for embryo transfer. Birth rate, litter size, pups' weight at weaning, interlitter interval and time to first litter were compared against a control group that did not receive EE. In mice breeders, EE significantly increased pups' weight compared to control group (p< 0.01), without changing any other reproductive parameters. In the offspring females used as recipients, EE did not modify reproductive parameters. Our results demonstrate that this enrichment plan, which is usually applied in mouse facilities for animal well-being, enhances pup's weight at weaning, with no negative effects on the reproductive performance of Swiss Webster mice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an environmental enrichment (EE) plan on the reproductive performance of Swiss Webster mice and their female offspring used as recipients for embryo transfer. A total of 54 breeder mice and 60 F1 females, used as foster mothers, were allocated in two experimental groups to receive or not receive EE for physical well-being. Reproductive outcomes of the Swiss trios such as birth rate and pup number, litter size, pups' weight at weaning, interlitter interval and time to first litter were analyzed. Environmental enrichment significantly increased pups weight from breeding trios compared to the control group (14.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 13.8g +/- 0.1, EE vs. control, respectively;p< 0.01). Other parameters did not differ between both groups. Reproductive parameters of female offspring used as recipients for embryo transfer did not differ among groups subjected or not to EE. These data demonstrate that the EE protocol applied in Swiss Webster breeder mice positively enhanced pups weight, and did not interfere with other reproductive outcomes. In conclusion, this study supports the implementation of EE plans usually applied for animal welfare in mouse facilities with slight improvement in reproductive performance.

AB  - It is known that the development and plasticity of the neuroendocrine system can be affected by many factors, and that adverse events during the prenatal period can result in long-lasting changes in adulthood. This study was aimed at evaluating the possible consequences for offspring from chronic inflammation during pregnancy. Chronic inflammation was simulated by treatment with increasing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to dams on days 15 through 19 of pregnancy. Attempts were made to prevent possible negative alterations by keeping animals in an enriched environment (EE). Maternal exposure to LPS resulted in a significant reduction of body weight of male offspring during the weaning period. This difference remained until the age of 63 days in controls (C), but not in animals reared in EE. The content of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens was found to be lower in prenatally stressed (PS) adult males. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to maternal immune challenge was associated with lower locomotor activity in elevated plus maze and increased number of skips in the beam-walking test, as observed in female offspring. No differences in ACTH and corticosterone concentrations with regard to prenatal treatment were found; however, both groups kept in EE showed increased levels of corticosterone as well as enlarged adrenal glands. Thus, immune activation during pregnancy may induce long-term changes in brain catecholamines and behavior, but it is not harmful to basal hormone secretion in the offspring.

AB  - Cancer patients often suffer long-lasting affective and cognitive impairments as a result of chemotherapy treatment. Previous work in our lab has shown deficits in learning and memory and hippocampal cell proliferation in mice lasting up to 20 weeks following acute administration of thioTEPA. In this study, the effects of thioTEPA in conjunction with effects of chronic stress on depression-related behavior were examined in C57BL/6J mice, 12 weeks following thioTEPA administration. Chemotherapy-treated mice showed a diminished sucralose preference compared to controls that was further exacerbated after 2 weeks of daily restraint stress. This intensifying effect was not observed in the Porsolt forced swim test. Moreover, stress-induced corticosteroid responses were exaggerated in thioTEPA-treated mice. Cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was also impaired similarly by prior thioTEPA treatment and by daily restraint stress, with no additive effect. Results suggest that some depression-related impairments may be exacerbated by chemotherapy treatment through altered corticosteroid regulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Childhood trauma is associated with the development of adult mental health and substance use disorders, with females generally being more at risk. Alcohol is commonly used for coping with trauma, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects similar to 14.4 million adult Americans annually. Research investigating sex differences in the environmental modification of anxiety and alcohol use following childhood trauma will extend our understanding of the etiology of AUD. Here, we sought to model the interacting effects of a single-episode late childhood trauma with post-trauma environment on adult alcohol use using male and female mice.
   Methods: C57Bl6/J mice (d22) exposed to predator odor (TMT) or water were reared in standard environments (SE) or environmental enrichment (EE). Mice were assessed for adolescent anxiety and conditioned fear, and for adult alcohol use in a limited access, response non-contingent, alcohol exposure paradigm.
   Results: A single exposure to predator odor was an effective stressor, inducing long-term sex-dependent changes in conditioned fear and alcohol behaviors that interacted with post-trauma environment. Adolescent EE females showed more conditioned freezing to the trauma-associated context. Adult EE mice consumed less total alcohol than SE mice. However, alcohol use across time differed for males and females. Exposure to a childhood stressor increased alcohol use significantly in females, but not males. EE males, but not EE females, drank less than SE counterparts.
   Conclusions: Findings from this model recapitulate greater vulnerability to childhood trauma in females and support sex differences in post-trauma development of conditioned fear and alcohol use that are modified by environment.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 221229. Abstract Spreading depression (SD), the likely cause of migraine aura and perhaps migraine, is triggered by widespread and unfettered neuronal hyperexcitability. Migraine and the initiating hyperexcitability of seizure, which involve oxidative stress (OS), are likely interrelated. Environmental enrichment (EE) decreases seizure and can reduce migraine. EEs well-characterized neuroprotective effect involves insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Accordingly, we asked if IGF-1 could mitigate the hyperexcitability that initiates SD using rat hippocampal slice cultures. We demonstrate that IGF-1 significantly decreased SD susceptibility and related OS. We mimicked OS of SD and observed that IGF-1 abolished hyperexcitability from OS. Application of an antioxidant significantly decreased SD susceptibility and co-administration of an antioxidant with IGF-1 produced no additive effect, whereas an oxidizer significantly increased SD, and this effect was abrogated by IGF-1. Moreover, IGF-1 significantly decreased baseline OS, despite seemingly paradoxically increasing CA3 bursting. These results suggest that IGF-1 increased endogenous antioxidants to levels sufficient to buffer against the OS of SD. Insulin similarly mitigated SD susceptibility, but required a far greater dose. Since brain IGF-1 increases with EE, and, like insulin, independently functions as an EE mimetic, we suggest that EE mimetics are a novel source of therapeutics for SD, and by extension, migraine.

AB  - Large preclinical evidence shows that exposure to social defeat (SD) increases vulnerability to drug abuse, increasing the consumption of ethanol. However, not all subjects are equally affected by the changes induced by stress. Previous reports have evidenced that the resilient phenotype to depressive-like behaviors after SD is associated with the resistant phenotype to cocaine-increased rewarding effects and the smaller neuroinflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to further clarify whether the resilient profile to depressive-like behavior also predicts a protection against the increase in ethanol intake induced by SD. The neuroinflammatory profile was studied after the end of the oral ethanol self-administration (SA) procedure, measuring levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the chemokine CX3CL1 or fractalkine in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have shown that environmental enrichment (EE) is an effective mechanism to dimish the detrimental effects of social stress. In a second study, we aimed to evaluate if EE housing before exposure to SD could potentiate resilience. Our results showed that mice with a phenotype susceptible to SD-induced depressive-like behaviors showed increased ethanol consumption and increased neuroinflammatory signaling. In contrast, despite the lack of effect on depressive-like behaviors, defeated mice previously housed under EE conditions did not show an increase in ethanol SA or an increase in immune response. To sum up, the resilient phenotype to SD develops at different levels, such as depressive-like behaviors, ethanol consumption and the neuroinflammatory response. Our results also point to the protective role of EE in potentiating resilience to SD effects.

AB  - The forced swim test (FST) is a behavioral test in rodents which was developed in 1978 by Porsolt and colleagues as a model for predicting the clinical efficacy of antidepressant drugs. A modified version of the FST added the classification of active behaviors into swimming and climbing, in order to facilitate the differentiation between serotonergic and noradrenergic classes of antidepressant drugs. The FST is now widely used in basic research and the pharmaceutical screening of potential antidepressant treatments. It is also one of the most commonly used tests to assess depressive-like behavior in animal models. Despite the simplicity and sensitivity of the FST procedure, important differences even in baseline immobility rates have been reported between different groups, which complicate the comparison of results across studies. In spite of several methodological papers and reviews published on the FST, the need still exists for clarification of factors which can influence the procedure. While most recent reviews have focused on antidepressant effects observed with the FST, this one considers the methodological aspects of the procedure, aiming to summarize issues beyond antidepressant action in the FST. The previously published literature is analyzed for factors which are known to influence animal behavior in the FST. These include biological factors, such as strain, age, body weight, gender and individual differences between animals; influence of preconditioning before the FST: handling, social isolation or enriched environment, food manipulations, various kinds of stress, endocrine manipulations and surgery; schedule and routes of treatment, dosage and type of the drugs as well as experimental design and laboratory environmental effects. Consideration of these factors in planning experiments may result in more consistent FST results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wild carnivores in zoos, conservation breeding centres, and farms commonly live in relatively small, unstimulating enclosures. Under these captive conditions, in a range of species including giant pandas, black-footed ferrets, and European mink, male reproductive abilities are often poor. Such problems have long been hypothesized to be caused by these animals' housing conditions. We show for the first time that rearing under welfare-improving (i.e., highly valued and stress-reducing) environmental enrichments enhances male carnivores' copulatory performance: in mate choice competitions, enriched male American mink (Neovison vison) mated more often than non-enriched males. We screened for several potential mediators of this effect. First was physiological stress and its impact on reproductive physiology; second, stress-mediated changes in morphology and variables related to immunocompetence that could influence male attractiveness; and third, behavioural changes likely to affect social competence, particularly autistic-like excessive routine and repetition ('perseveration') as is reflected in the stereotypies common in captive animals. Consistent with physiological stress, excreted steroid metabolites revealed that non-enriched males had higher cortisol levels and lower androgen levels than enriched conspecifics. Their os penises (bacula) also tended to be less developed. Consistent with reduced attractiveness, non-enriched males were lighter, with comparatively small spleens and a trend to greater fluctuating asymmetry. Consistent with impaired social competence, non-enriched males performed more stereotypic behaviour (e. g., pacing) in their home cages. Of all these effects, the only significant predictor of copulation number was stereotypy (a trend suggesting that low bodyweights may also be influential): highly stereotypic males gained the fewest copulations. The neurophysiological changes underlying stereotypy thus handicap males sexually. We hypothesise that such males are abnormally perseverative when interacting with females. Investigating similar problems in other taxa would be worthwhile, since many vertebrates, wild and domestic, live in conditions that cause stereotypic behaviour and/or impair neurological development.

AB  - Environmental conditions are known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. In this study, the effects of sertraline, a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were investigated in rats reared in different housing conditions. Wistar rats of both sexes were divided into three groups according to their rearing conditions (Enriched = EC, Isolated = IC and Standard = SC), after weaning at postnatal day 21. While animals in control conditions were housed as a group of 4 rats in regular size plexiglass cages, social isolation groups were housed individually in metal cages. Animals in enriched conditions were housed as a group of 12 rats in specially designed cages equipped with different stimulating objects. Six weeks later, activitymeter, elevated plus maze, rotarod, grip, forced swimming and sucrose preference tests were applied to all animals and all of the tests were repeated after i.p. injection of sertraline (10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Environmental enrichment reduced the stereotypic behavior, improved the motor coordination and facilitated the learning skills in animals. However, housing conditions affected depression-like parameters, but not anxiety-like parameters. Sertraline treatment reduced the depression-like effect in EC and SC, but not in IC. It decreased anxiety-like behavior in IC while increased in EC. Socially isolated animals preferentially consumed more sucrose and water than the other groups, and interestingly, these differences became more significant following sertraline treatment. These results show that the responses of animals to anti-depressive drugs could be differentially affected by the behavioral consequences of the diverse housing conditions. Thus, to improve the treatment of depression: behavioral consequences of diverse housing conditions should be taken into consideration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) model has been suggested as a model of adult and adolescent depression though face, predictive and construct validities of the model to depression remain equivocal. The suitability of the WKY as a diathesis model that tests the double-hit hypothesis, particularly during critical periods of brain and behavioural development remains to be established. Here, effects of post-weaning social isolation were assessed during early adolescence (similar to 30pnd) on behavioural despair and learned helplessness in the forced swim test (FST), plasma corticosterone levels and tissue monoamine concentrations in brain areas critically involved in depression, such as prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum and hippocampus. Significantly increased immobility in the FST was observed in socially-isolated, adolescent WKY with a concomitant increase in corticosterone levels over and above the FST-induced stress. WKY also demonstrated a significantly increased release and utilization of dopamine, as manifested by levels of metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in nucleus accumbens, indicating that the large dopamine storage pool evident during adolescence induces greater dopamine release when stimulated. The serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid was also significantly increased in nucleus accumbens, indicating increased utilization of serotonin, along with norepinephrine levels which were also signficantly elevated in socially-isolated adolescent WKY. Differences in neurochemistry suggest that social or environmental stimuli during critical periods of brain and behavioural development can determine the developmental trajectories of implicated pathways.

AB  - Early life is a critical and sensitive period whereby environmental imprints on later life are generated. These environmental influences from early life have long-lasting consequences on for mental health. Both human and animal work suggests that maternal presence constitutes an important part of the early experience. Maternal separation causes a sustained increase in stress responsiveness later in life, along with facilitated anxiety-like behaviors. On the contrary, providing a complex and enriching sensory environment during or after stress, on the other hand, creates resilience to stress. In this chapter, we summarize these environmental influences on the maternal interactions and subsequent stress susceptibility or resilience of the offspring.

AB  - Chronic stress results in cognitive impairment, affects hippocampal neurogenesis and is known to precipitate affective disorders such as depression. In addition to stress, neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh) modulate adult neurogenesis. Earlier, we have shown that oxotremorine, a cholinergic muscarinic agonist, ameliorates stress-induced cognitive impairment and restores cholinergic function.
   In the current study, we have looked into the possible involvement of adult neurogenesis in cognitive restoration by oxotremorine. Further, we have assessed the effect of oxotremorine treatment on depression-like behaviour and hippocampal volumes in stressed animals.
   Chronic restraint stressed rats were treated with either vehicle or oxotremorine. For neurogenesis studies, proliferation, survival and differentiation of the progenitor cells in the hippocampus were examined using 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine immunohistochemistry. Depression-like behaviour was evaluated using forced swim test (FST) and sucrose consumption test (SCT). Volumes were estimated using Cavalieri's estimator.
   Hippocampal neurogenesis was severely decreased in stressed rats. Ten days of oxotremorine treatment to stressed animals partially restored proliferation and survival, while it completely restored the differentiation of the newly formed cells. Stressed rats showed increased immobility and decreased sucrose preference in the FST and SCT, respectively, and oxotremorine ameliorated this depression-like behaviour. In addition, oxotremorine treatment recovered the stress-induced decrease in hippocampal volume.
   These results indicate that the restoration of impaired neurogenesis and hippocampal volume could be associated with the behavioural recovery by oxotremorine. Our results imply the muscarinic regulation of adult neurogenesis and incite the potential utility of cholinomimetics in ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in stress-related disorders.

AB  - Objective: The present study was aimed at the investigation of the effects of chronic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade applied during the late stage of brain maturation (days 20-30 after birth) and physical environment on affective behaviors during adulthood in socially isolated rats.
   Methods: In order to establish a social isolation model, the experimental animals were kept in individual cages, starting from 21 days of age till adulthood. The socially isolated rats, which were reared under standard and enriched environmental conditions, were administered with MK-801 (between days 20-30 after birth for a period of 10 days at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight, twice a day, by subcutaneous route). As from 3 months of age, the behavior of the adult rats was assessed using the open-field test, light-dark preference test and the elevated plus-maze test.
   Results: In the open-field test, it was observed that the frequency of rearing, considered as exploratory behavior, has increased significantly in the group administered with physiological saline and isolated under enriched physical environmental conditions compared to the group isolated under standard physical environmental conditions (p<0.01). In the elevated plus-maze test, the duration of the period the animals remained in the open arm has shortened in the group, which was administered with physiological saline and isolated under enriched physical environmental conditions in comparison to the animals exposed to standard physical environmental conditions (p<0.01). Compared to the group given physiological saline, in the group administered with MK-801 and reared in a standard physical environment, a significant decrease was observed in the same parameter (p<0,05).
   Conclusion: In conclusion, growth under enriched physical environmental conditions provides protection against both adulthood anxieties arising from NMDA receptor hypofunction in early childhood and emotional and behavioral abnormalities related to novel stimuli.

AB  - Introduction: Interventions performed in the early period of life are associated with cognitive and behavioral changes in adulthood. The effects of interventions such as exposure to an early stressful life event or environmental enrichment on cognitive and behavioral development are studied. The aim of this study is to develop a new intervention method, to investigate the effects of early interventions on social interaction, memory anxiety levels and NR2B levels in prefrontal and hippocampus in adulthood. The hypothesis of the study is that exposure to the ambivalent mother will affect the behavioral performance of rats at least as much as one hour apart from the mother in the adult period and cause changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the NR2B levels.
   Method: In the study, the Wistar rats were divided into four groups as control group (12), group that remained 15 minutes apart from mother (Mild Stress) (12), group that remained 60 minutes apart from mother (Severe Stress) (14) and ambivalent mother group (13). In adulthood, the social interaction test, elevated plus maze and new object recognition test performances of rats were evaluated. ELISA method was used to evaluate the effect of interventions on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus NMDA R2B levels.
   Results: The important findings of the study were that in the new object recognition test, separation from the mother did not affect the recognition memory regardless of gender, while the short-term recognition memory of the females of the ambivalent mothers' group was better than the females in the other groups and the long-term memory performance of the mild stress groups men was better than the man in the other groups. In addition, in the social interaction test, the males of the ambivalent group and the mild stress group showed more aggressive behavior. It was determined that the prefrontal cortex NR2B level was higher in the mild stress and ambivalent mother group compared to the severe stress group, and NR2B level was increased in all intervention groups compared to the control group.
   Conclusion: In contrast to the hypothesis, the results of this study support that the ambivalent mother's group rats are not more adversely affected than the severe group rats and that the model created may be an environmental enrichment model rather than an early stressful life event exposure.

AB  - Experimental research has recently revealed that paternal environmental conditions can influence the offspring phenotype through epigenetic mechanisms. However, it is unclear whether these effects impact adaptive responses in the offspring. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a well-established paradigm that promotes neural plasticity. We investigated whether EE in male mice could modify behaviours that are highly relevant for determining adaptive fitness, i.e. spatial memory, attractiveness and social dominance, in the offspring of outbred mice. Male Swiss mice were housed in either EE or standard housing from post-weaning to adulthood before breeding for offspring. Their offspring were raised in standard housing until adulthood then assessed for behavioural, physiological and molecular parameters. F-0 male mice exposed to EE had lower body weight, higher adrenal, spleen and hippocampal weights, better novelty processing and spatial learning, greater hippocampal BDNF levels, and higher social dominance. Unexpectedly, their male offspring (F-1) showed spatial memory impairment, lowered social dominance and were less attractive to receptive females, compared to controls. These ethologically relevant measures suggest a maladaptive response in the male F-1 offspring. Interestingly, when separate cohorts of male F-1 offspring of standard housing or EE fathers were exposed to 8-day EE protocol during adulthood, differences in spatial memory and attractiveness to receptive females were no longer observed between them. These results provide evidence that the paternal environment can influence the offspring's adaptiveness.

AB  - Gestational stress can increase postpartum depression in women. To treat maternal depression, fluoxetine (FLX) is most commonly prescribed. While FLX may be effective for the mother, at high doses it may have adverse effects on the fetus. As environmental enrichment (EE) can reduce maternal stress effects, we hypothesized that a subthreshold dose of FLX increases the impact of EE to reduce anxiety and depression-like behavior in postpartum dams exposed to gestational stress. We evaluated this hypothesis in mice and to assess underlying mechanisms we additionally measured hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and brain levels of the hormone oxytocin, which are thought to be implicated in postpartum depression. Gestational stress increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in postpartum dams. This was accompanied by an increase in HPA axis function and a decrease in whole-brain oxytocin levels in dams. A combination of FLX and EE remediated the behavioral, HPA axis and oxytocin changes induced by gestational stress. Central administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist prevented the remediating effect of FLX+EE, indicating that brain oxytocin contributes to the effect of FLX+EE. These findings suggest that oxytocin is causally involved in FLX+EE mediated remediation of postpartum stress-related behaviors, and HPA axis function in postpartum dams.

AB  - Although aging and environmental stimulation are well-known to affect cognitive abilities, the question of whether aging effects can be distinguished in already-mature adult rats has not been fully addressed. In the present study, therefore, young and mature adult rats were housed in either enriched or standard conditions (EE or SC) for three months. Open-field (OFT) and radial-maze (RM) behavior, and ex-vivo contents of GABA and glutamate in hippocampus, and of dopamine and DOPAC in ventral striatum (VS) were analyzed and compared between the four groups. In OFT, young rats were more active than mature adults irrespective of the housing condition. Surprisingly, in the RM test, mature adults outperformed young counterparts except for the young-enriched rats, which showed a progressive improvement in RM performance. At the neurochemical level, young EE rats showed higher hippocampal glutamate and GABA concentrations, and DA turnover in VS, which correlated with RM performance. Altogether, the behavioral and cognitive strategies underlying habituation learning and spatial memory seem to be qualitatively different between the two ages analyzed. These results challenge the assumption that mature adult animals are always worse in learning and memory tasks. However, young rats benefited more from the social and physical stimulation provided by the enrichment than mature adult counterparts. The latter effect was evident not just on behavior, but also on brain neurochemistry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of environmental conditions on the birth hormones and the labor of rats. Materials and methods: This Study is animal experiment. A total of of 18 pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, stress and enriched groups. Animals in the stress group were exposed to unexpected variable stress paradigm three times a day during the third trimester of their pregnancies. Whereas animals raised in the enriched environment were kept in larger cages equipped with various toys. They were subjected to open field test for 5 minutes in the last trimester. Blood samples were taken from the tail vein at the beginning of birth, and 10 parameters (including corticotropin-releasing hormone, oxytocin, endorphin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, prolactin, estrogen, progesterone, vasopressin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) involved in labor were assessed. Kruskal Wallis, Mann Whitney U, and Spearman's rho correlation analysis were used to compare data. Results: Interactions of hormones were significantly different among the groups. While hormonal interactions in the control group were similar to the physiological parameters, other groups displayed various results. There were significant (p < .05) differences in the values of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin hormone levels. In the open Field test, standing distribution scores of animals displayed differences among control, stress and enriched environment groups (p < .05). Conclusion: These results showed that labor environment diversely affects physiology aspects of birth. It is known that many factors such as procedures in a hospital environment, birth environment, noise, and birth position affect the hormones at birth. Therefore, the birth environment, either at home or at the hospital, needs to be well-organized accordingly.

AB  - The major issues regarding the welfare of both farmed and laboratory rabbits are reviewed, according to husbandry and management systems. The main stressors that can affect welfare and homeostatic responses in rabbits are also reviewed. An overview of the most widespread housing systems for both farmed and laboratory rabbits is presented. The main problems related to housing and management are identified, in particular those related to individual and group housing, space requirements and group size, as well as human-animal interaction. The effects of psychological and physical stressors on physiology and behaviour are illustrated through examples in various rearing conditions. Psychological stressors include social stress and fear, while physical stressors include environmental variables such as housing system and climatic factors, i.e. heat. Welfare indicators are identified that can be monitored to determine the effects of individual and environmental variables on the animals' possible coping strategies. Physiological indicators include the neuro-enclocrine and psycbo-neuro-immuno-endocrine measurements, while behavioural indicators include the behavioural repertoire and responses to behavioural tests. Some possible ways to enhance welfare are indicated, such as enrichment of the environment and improved handling procedures. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hippocampus has long been implicated in memory formation. Although accumulating evidence suggests involvement of the hippocampus in other brain functions including locomotor regulation and emotional processes, cellular and synaptic bases underlying these functions remain largely unknown. We here report that environmental manipulations in mice unveiled the association of locomotor activity with the hippocampal mossy fibre (MF) synaptic transmission. Electrophysiological recordings of synaptic responses were made using hippocampal slices prepared from mice whose behaviour had been analysed. Environmental enrichment induced parallel decreases in open-field locomotor activity and MF synaptic facilitation. Facilitation induced by paired-pulse stimulation at relatively long intervals (>= 200 ms) was selectively reduced while the basal synaptic efficacy and high-frequency transmission were unaffected. Social isolation caused a change in behaviour in an elevated plus-maze, but neither the open-field activity nor the MF synaptic transmission was significantly altered. Effects of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for locomotor regulation, on the MF synapse were also examined using these mice. Environmental manipulations did not cause significant changes in potentiation of the MF synaptic transmission induced by dopamine. However, analysis of behavioural and electrophysiological results in individual subjects revealed that locomotor activity negatively correlates with magnitude of the dopamine-induced potentiation. These results suggest that the MF synapse plays important roles in the regulation of locomotor activity. We propose that the MF synapse can serve as the synaptic model for certain forms of locomotor regulation, with potential importance for investigation of the pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases using animal models.

AB  - The selective breeding of Roman low-avoidance (RLA) and high-avoidance (RHA) rats for, respectively, poor versus rapid acquisition of active avoidance in a shuttle-box has produced two phenotypes that differ drastically in the reactivity to stressful stimuli: in tests used to assess emotionality, RLA rats display passive ("reactive") coping and robust hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity, whereas RHA rats show proactive coping and blunted HPA axis responses. The behavioral and neuroendocrine traits that distinguish these lines suggest that RLA rats may be prone, whereas RHA rats may be resistant to develop depression-like behavior when exposed to stressful experimental conditions.
   To evaluate the performance of the Roman lines in the forced swim test, immobility, climbing, and swimming were assessed under baseline conditions (i.e., pretest in na < ve animals or test after the administration of vehicle), and after subacute treatment with desipramine, fluoxetine, and chlorimipramine.
   Under baseline conditions, RLA rats displayed greater immobility and fewer climbing counts than RHA rats. In RLA rats, desipramine, fluoxetine, and chlorimipramine decreased immobility; moreover, desipramine and chlorimipramine increased climbing, whereas fluoxetine increased swimming. In RHA rats, none of these drugs affected immobility, swimming, or climbing.
   RLA and RHA rats represent two divergent phenotypes respectively susceptible and resistant to display depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. Hence, comparative studies in these lines may help to develop novel working hypotheses on the relationships among genotype, temperament traits, and neural mechanisms underlying the vulnerability or resistance to stress-induced depression in humans.

AB  - To date, there is yet no established effective treatment (medication or cognitive intervention) for post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with chronic sequelae. Enriched environment (EE) has been recognized of importance in brain regulation, behaviour and physiology. Rodents reared in, or pre-exposed to EE, recovered better from brain insults. Using the concussive head trauma model of minimal TBI in mice, we evaluated the effect of transition to EE following a weight-drop (30g or 50g) induced mTBI on behavioural and cognitive parameters in mice in the Novel Object Recognition task, the Y- and the Elevated Plus mazes. In all assays, both mTBI groups (30 g, 50 g) housed in normal conditions were equally and significantly impaired 6 weeks post injury in comparison with the no-mTBI (p < 0.001 and p < 0.03, respectively) and the mTBI + EE groups (p < 0.001 for the 30 g, and p < 0.017 for the 50 g). No differences were found between the control and the EE mice. Two separate finding emerge: (1) the significantly positive effects of the placement in EE following mTBI, on the rehabilitative process of the tested behaviours in the affected mice; (2) the lack of difference between the groups of mice affected by 30g or by 50g. Further studies are needed in order to characterize the exact pathways involved in the positive effects of the EE on mice recovery from mTBI. Possible clinical implications indicate the importance of adapting correlates of EE to humans, i.e., prolonged and intensive physical activity - possibly combined with juggling training and intensive cognitive stimulation.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) can reduce anxiety and stress in experimental animals, while little is known about the influence on autonomic nervous activity especially in disease animal models. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, which can be characterized by a higher resting heart rate and a lower heart rate variability (HRV). We hypothesized that EE can enhance parasympathetic nervous activity while reducing disease progression in type 2 diabetic mice. A telemetry transmitter was implanted in NSY mice to continuously record electrocardiograms (ECG). Animals were kept in a cage with or without a nest box as EE. The autonomic nervous activity was evaluated using power spectral analysis of HRV. Four weeks of EE could increase high frequency (HF) power, but no change was observed in the absence of EE. Although animals showed impaired glucose tolerance at 48 weeks of age regardless of EE, a worsen case was observed in control. These results indicate that EE can be necessary for long-term housing of experimental animals and may reduce the risk of impaired glucose tolerance in NSY mice by enhancing parasympathetic nervous activity. In future, it is demanded whether increasing parasympathetic nervous activity, whatever the method is, can prevent diabetes from worsening.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) can cause long-term changes in gene expression, affect cognition, mood, and behavior, and increase susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood, in which the histone acetylation plays a crucial role. Studies have found that environmental enrichment (EE) mitigated the unfavorable outcomes of ELS. However, the underlying mechanism of the histone acetylation is not yet completely clear. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of EE on the histone acetylation after ELS. In this study, using single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm in early adolescent rats explored the long-term effects of ELS on behavior, the activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), as well as the acetylation levels of the lysine 9 site of histone H3 (H3K9) and lysine 12 site of histone H4 (H4K12) in the hippocampus and amygdala. Meanwhile, the protective effects of EE intervention were examined. We found that adult male rats exposed to ELS showed behavioral changes, including reduced locomotor activity, increased anxiety-like behaviors, impaired spatial learning and memory, enhanced contextual and cued fear memory, and the HATs/ HDACs ratio and acetyl H3K9 (Ac H3K9) and acetyl H4K12 (Ac H4K12) were increased in the hippocampus and decreased in the amygdala. Furthermore, EE attenuated the behavioral abnormalities from ELS, possibly through down-regulating the activity of HATs in the hippocampus and up-regulating HDACs activities in the amygdala. These finding suggested that EE could ameliorate ELS-induced PTSD-like behaviors by regulating histone acetylation in the hippocampus and amygdala, reducing the susceptibility to PTSD in adulthood.

AB  - Prior research demonstrated that environmental enrichment creates individual differences in behavior leading to a protective addiction phenotype in rats. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenotype will guide selection of targets for much-needed novel pharmacotherapeutics. The current study investigates differences in proteome expression in the nucleus accumbens of enriched and isolated rats and the proteomic response to cocaine self-administration using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) technique to quantify 1917 proteins. Results of complementary Ingenuity Pathways Analyses (IPA) and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), both performed using protein quantitative data, demonstrate that cocaine increases vesicular transporters for dopamine and glutamate as well as increasing proteins in the RhoA pathway. Further, cocaine regulates proteins related to ERK, CREB and AKT signaling. Environmental enrichment altered expression of a large number of proteins implicated in a diverse number of neuronal functions (e.g., energy production, mRNA splicing, and ubiquitination), molecular cascades (e.g., protein kinases), psychiatric disorders (e.g., mood disorders), and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases). Upregulation of energy metabolism components in EC rats was verified using RNA sequencing. Most of the biological functions and pathways listed above were also identified in the Cocaine X Enrichment interaction analysis, providing clear evidence that enriched and isolated rats respond quite differently to cocaine exposure. The overall impression of the current results is that enriched saline-administering rats have a unique proteomic complement compared to enriched cocaine-administering rats as well as saline and cocaine-taking isolated rats. These results identify possible mechanisms of the protective phenotype and provide fertile soil for developing novel pharmacotherapeutics.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effects of specific regimens of enrichment on the behaviour of C57BL/6J mice in the elevated plus-maze test (EPM). A total of 192 male C57BL/6J mice were allocated randomly to 32 cages. Three different items of cage furniture (CF) made of aspen - a mouse corner, nestbox and stairs - were added stepwise to different cages at intervals of one week so that the mice were exposed to an item of CF for one, two, three or four weeks. On the fifth week, all the mice were subjected to the EPM test. Overall, the presence of the nestbox or stairs for the three weeks appeared to have an anxiolytic effect on the behaviour of the mice, as evidenced by an increase in the number of entries made into the open arms and the time spent in the open arms of the EPM. The effects of these items of CF on the behaviour of the mice depended on the item used and on the duration of exposure. The items of CF that were used in this study appeared to improve the quality of life of C57BL/6J mice, as assessed using the EPM.

AB  - Primary objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of mild-to-moderate (m-mod) traumatic brain injury (TBI) on spontaneous object (SO) recognition and temporal order (TO) memory in male Wistar rats and to compare the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) and simvastatin (Sim) on SO and TO memory post-injury.
   Research design: A randomized repeated measure experimental design was used.
   Methods and procedure: Seven days after arrival, animals received the injury or sham surgery. Using a Y-shaped maze, SO and TO memory was assessed in the two groups of animals at 6, 24, 48, 72 hours and 7, 14, 21 and 35 days post-surgery. Total time exploring each object and discrimination ratio were calculated and analysed. Then SO and TO memory were compared between two groups that received either Sim or EE for 2 hours daily starting 24 hours post-injury and a sham group that received saline for 14 days post-injury.
   Results: The results showed that the injury impaired SO and TO memory compared to the sham up to 35 days post-trauma. Injured animals exhibited familiarity preference, novelty aversion and impaired TO performance. EE improved the animals' SO recognition deficits 7 days post-injury after a shorter delay (1 minute) only and Sim reversed TO memory deficits 14 days post-injury after a longer delay (60 minutes).
   Conclusion: Persistent SO and TO memory deficits follow TBI in animals; Simv and EE seem to be promising therapies of TBI memory deficits.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) increases stimulation and provides richer sensory, cognitive and motor opportunities through the interaction with the social and physical environment. EE produces a wide range of neuroanatomical, neurochemical and behavioural effects in several animal species. However, the effects of EE have mainly been studied shortly after the treatment, so its long-lasting effects remain to be elucidated. Thus, we studied in mate and female Sprague-Dawley rats the enduring effects of EE on tasks that measured emotional reactivity, social exploration and memory, sensorimotor gating and learning. After weaning, rats reared in EE were housed in single-sex groups of 12-14 in enriched cages during 12 weeks, whereas control rats were housed in single-sex groups of 2-3 animals in standard cages. Then, all rats were housed in pairs and successively exposed to different tests between 4 and 60 weeks post-EE. The results indicated that animals of both sexes reared in EE gained less weight during the enrichment period; differences disappeared in females during the post-EE period, but were maintained intact in mates. Rats reared in EE showed an altered daily pattern of corticosterone and a tower hormone response to a novel environment (hole board, HB), although no differences in ACTH were found. EE resulted in more exploratory behaviour in the HB and higher number of entries in the open arms of the elevated plus maze (with no changes in the time spent in the open arms), suggesting a greater motivation to explore. Unexpectedly, rats reared in EE showed reduced pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensorimotor gating, suggesting lower capability to filter non-relevant information compared with control rats. EE increased social exploratory behaviour towards juvenile rats and social discrimination in mates, but decreased social discrimination in females. Finally, in the Hebb-Williams maze, rats reared in EE showed better performance in terms of reduced number of errors and shorter distances travelled in the mazes. It is concluded that EE exposure from weaning to adulthood has important and tong-lasting consequences on physiological and behavioural variables, most of them similar in both sexes, although sex differences in response to the EE are also reported.

AB  - Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) promotes ethanol consumption in the adolescent offspring accompanied by the transcriptional regulation of kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system genes. This study analysed if environmental enrichment (EE, from gestational day 20 to postnatal day 26) exerts protective effects upon PEE-modulation of gene expression, ethanol intake and anxiety responses. Pregnant rats were exposed to PEE (0.0 or 2.0 g/kg ethanol, gestational days 17-20) and subsequently the dam and offspring were reared under EE or standard conditions. PEE upregulated KOR mRNA levels in amygdala (AMY) and prodynorphin (PDYN) mRNA levels in ventral tegmental area (VTA) with the latter effect associated with lower DNA methylation at the gene promoter. These effects were normalized by exposure to EE. PEE modulated BDNF mRNA levels in VTA and Nucleus accumbens (AcbN), and EE mitigated the changes in AcbN. EE induced a protective effect on ethanol intake and preference, an effect more noticeable in males than in females, and in prenatal vehicle-treated (PV) than in PEE rats. The male offspring drank significantly less ethanol than the female offspring. The latter result suggests that the protective effect of EE on ethanol drinking may only emerge at lower levels of drinking. In the dams, PEE induced an upregulation of PDYN and KOR in AcbN. PDYN gene expression was normalized by exposure to EE. These results suggest that EE is a promising treatment to inhibit the effects of PEE. The results confirm that PEE effects are mediated by alterations in the transcriptional regulation of KOR system genes.

AB  - Since life emerged on the Earth, the development of efficient strategies to cope with sudden and/or permanent changes of the environment has been virtually the unique goal pursued by every organism in order to ensure its survival and thus perpetuate the species. In this view, evolution has selected tightly regulated processes aimed at maintaining stability among internal parameters despite external changes, a process termed homeostasis. Such an internal equilibrium relies quite heavily on three interrelated physiological systems: the nervous, immune, and endocrine systems, which function as a permanently activated watching network, communicating by the mean of specialized molecules: neurotransmitters, cytokines, and hormones or neurohormones. Potential threats to homeostasis might occur as early as during in utero life, potentially leaving a lasting mark on the developing organism. Indeed, environmental factors exert early-life influences on the structural and functional development of individuals, giving rise to changes that can persist throughout life. This organizational phenomenon, encompassing prenatal environmental events, altered fetal growth, and development of long-term pathophysiology, has been named early-life programming. Over the past decade, increased scientific activities have been devoted to deciphering the obvious link between states of maternal stress and the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and physiological reactivity of the progeny. This growing interest has been driven by the discovery of a tight relationship between prenatal stress and development of short- and long-term health disorders. Among factors susceptible of contributing to such a deleterious programming, nutrients and hormones, especially steroid hormones, are considered as powerful mediators of the fetal organization since they readily cross the placental barrier. In particular, variations in circulating maternal glucocorticoids are known to impact this programming strongly, notably when hormonal surges occur during sensitive periods of development, so-called developmental windows of vulnerability. Stressful events occurring during the perinatal period may impinge on various aspects of the neuroendocrine programming, subsequently amending the offspring's growth, metabolism, sexual maturation, stress responses, and immune system. Such prenatal stress-induced modifications of the phenotypic plasticity of the progeny might ultimately result in the development of long-term diseases, from metabolic syndromes to psychiatric disorders. Yet, we would like to consider the outcome of this neuroendocrine programming from an evolutionary perspective. Early stressful events during gestation might indeed shape internal parameters of the developing organisms in order to adapt the progeny to its everyday environment and thus contribute to an increased reproductive success, or fitness, of the species. Moreover, parental care, adoption, or enriched environments after birth have been shown to reverse negative long-term consequences of a disturbed gestational environment. In this view, considering the higher potential for neonatal plasticity within the brain in human beings as compared to other species, long-term consequences of prenatal stress might not be as inexorable as suggested in animal-based studies published to date.

AB  - Although social, physical, and cognitive activities have each been suggested to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), epidemiologic studies cannot determine which activity or combination of activities is most important. To address this question, mutant APP transgenic AD mice were reared long-term in one of four housing conditions (impoverished, social, social + physical, or complete enrichment) from 1 1/2 through 9 months of age. Thus, a stepwise layering of social, physical, and enhanced cognitive activity was created. Behavioral evaluation in a full battery of sensorimotor, anxiety, and cognitive tasks was carried out during the final 5 weeks of housing. Only AD mice raised in complete enrichment (i.e., enhanced cognitive activity) showed: (1) protection against cognitive impairment, (2) decreased brain P-amyloid deposition, and (3) increased hippocampal synaptic immunoreactivity. The protection provided by enhanced cognitive activity spanned multiple cognitive domains (working memory, reference learning, and recognition/identification). Cognitive and neurohistologic benefits of complete enrichment occurred without any changes in blood cytokine or corticosterone levels, suggesting that enrichment-dependent mechanisms do not involve changes in the inflammatory response or stress levels, respectively. These results indicate that the enhanced cognitive activity of complete enrichment is required for cognitive and neurologic benefit to AD mice-physical and/or social activity are insufficient. Thus, our data suggest that humans who emphasize a high lifelong level of cognitive activity (over and above social and physical activities) will attain the maximal environmental protection against AD.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to modulate behavior and immunity. We recently reported that both short and long-term EE enhance baseline locomotion and alleviate depressive-like behavior, but only long-term EE affects locomotion adversely in a threatening environment and enhances anxiety-like behavior in middle-age mice. We have now investigated whether the observed changes in behavior after short- and long-term EE were associated with underlying immune changes. Hence, at the end of behavioral testing, mice were sacrificed, and brains and cervical lymph nodes were collected to investigate the differential effects of the duration of EE (short- and long-term) on the number of immunopositive glial cells in the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and proportions of T cell subsets in the cervical lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, respectively. EE, regardless of duration, caused an increase in microglia number within the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, but only long-term EE increased astrocytes number within the dentate gyrus and CA3 hippocampal regions. A significantly higher proportion of CD8(+) naive T cells was observed after long-term EE vs. short-term EE. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of central memory and effector memory T cells or early activated CD25(+) cells between any of the test groups. Our results suggest that EE, irrespective of duration, enhances the numbers of microglia, but long-term EE is required to modify astrocyte number and peripheral T cell proportions in middle-aged mice. Our findings provide new insights into the therapeutic effects of EE on various brain disorders, which may be at least partly mediated by glial and neuroimmune modulation.

AB  - Our aim was to assess the changes in the Synapsin I and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression induced by behavioral testing in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of standard and enriched aged Wistar rats. The environmental enrichment (EE) was carried out 3 h/day over a period of two months and then, the rats were tested in the elevated zero-maze (EZM) and radial-arm water maze (RAWM). Behavioral results showed that, even at an advanced age, EE was able to reduce anxiety-related behaviors and improve the performance in the RAWM. Regarding the neurobiological data, Synapsin I expression in the dorsal CA3, but not in the ventral, was enhanced both in enriched and standard rats when they performed the behavioral testing. Interestingly, the EE exposure was enough to increase Synapsin I in the ventral CA3. The analysis of GR in the dorsal hippocampus showed an increase of this receptor in the dDG both in enriched and standard rats when they performed the behavioral testing, whereas in the dCA1 and dCA3, the effect of the testing depended on the previous housing condition. In the ventral region, we found that the effects of EE were higher because on the one hand, the GR expression induced by the behavioral testing was enhanced in the dSUB, vCA1 and vCA3 when the rats were previously enriched and on the other hand, EE, regardless of the behavioral testing, increased the GR expression in the vDG and vSUB. Therefore, our results suggest that the effect of the behavioral testing on the neurobiological mechanisms studied is different depending on the previous housing condition of aged rats.

AB  - Feline elimination problems are commonly presented to general practitioners and behavioral medicine specialists. The correct diagnosis is often missed by veterinarians owing to individual variation and multifactorial cases. Three diagnostic umbrellas need to be considered: medical problems, toileting behavior outside of the litter box, and urine marking. The treatment plan for most cases, regardless of etiology, involves optimum litter box management, fulfilling cats' environmental needs, stress reduction, behavior therapy techniques, and trigger removal. Medical management with psychoactive medication might be necessary in cases in which chronic stress, fear, and anxiety play a role in the feline patient's symptomatology.

AB  - Animals housed in artificial habitats are confronted by a wide range of potentially provocative environmental challenges. In this article, we review many of the potential stressors that may adversely affect animals living in captivity. These include abiotic, environmental sources of stress such as artificial lighting, exposure to loud or aversive sound, arousing odors, and uncomfortable temperatures or substrates. In addition, confinement-specific stressors such as restricted movement, reduced retreat space, forced proximity to humans, reduced feeding opportunities, maintenance in abnormal social groups, and other restrictions of behavioral opportunity are considered. Research in support of the claims for these environmental elements as stressors for captive animals reveals no unique suite of behavioral or physiological responses that will clearly indicate the cause of those responses; rather, it is up to us as managers and caretakers of animals in captivity to evaluate enclosures and husbandry practices to ensure the optimal well-being of animals in our care.

AB  - Until today, anti-microbial drugs have been the therapy of choice to combat bacterial diseases. Resistance against antibiotics is of growing concern in man and animals. Stress, caused by demanding environmental conditions, can reduce immune protection in the host, influencing the onset and outcome of infectious diseases. Therefore psychoneuro-immunological intervention may prove to be a successful approach to diminish the impact of diseases and antibiotics use. This study was designed to investigate the effect of social and environmental enrichment on the impact of disease, referred to as "disease susceptibility", in pigs using a co-infection model of PRRSV and A. pleuropneumoniae. Twenty-eight pigs were raised in four pens under barren conditions and twenty-eight other pigs were raised in four pens under enriched conditions. In the enriched pens a combination of established social and environmental enrichment factors were introduced. Two pens of the barren (BH) and two pens of the enriched housed (EH) pigs were infected with PRRSV followed by A. pleuropneumoniae, the other two pens in each housing treatment served as control groups. We tested if differences in disease susceptibility in terms of pathological and clinical outcome were related to the different housing regimes and if this was reflected in differences in behavioural and immunological states of the animals. Enriched housed pigs showed a faster clearance of viral PRRSV RNA in blood serum (p = 0.014) and histologically 2.8 fold less interstitial pneumonia signs in the lungs (p = 0.014). More barren housed than enriched housed pigs developed lesions in the lungs (OR = 19.2, p = 0.048) and the lesions in the barren housed pigs showed a higher total pathologic tissue damage score (p<0.001) than those in enriched housed pigs. EH pigs showed less stress-related behaviour and differed immunologically and clinically from BH pigs. We conclude that enriched housing management reduces disease susceptibility to co-infection of PRRSV and A. pleuropneumoniae in pigs. Enrichment positively influences behavioural state, immunological response and clinical outcome in pigs.

AB  - Limbic system associated membrane protein (Lsamp) gene is involved in behavioral adaptation in social and anxiogenic environments and has been associated with a broad spectrum of psychiatric diseases. Here we studied the activity of alternative promoters of Lsamp gene in mice in three rearing conditions (standard housing, environmental enrichment and social isolation) and in two different genetic backgrounds (129S6/SvEv and C57BL/6). Isolation had no effect on the expression levels of Lsamp. Environmental enrichment elevated the expression levels of Lsamp 1b transcript specifically in the hippocampus in B6 mice, and the same tendency existed across both mouse lines and both transcripts. Furthermore, we showed that the density of cells exhibiting 1b promoter activity is remarkably higher in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampal formation which is a specific area of enrichment-induced neurogenesis in adult rodents. On the contrary to 1b, 1a promoter is selectively active in the pyramidal and granule cell layers. We provide evidence that Lsamp modulates enrichment-induced activation of Bdnf as the enrichment-induced elevation of Bdnf in the hippocampus is significantly diminished in Lsamp-deficient mice; furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the expression levels of Lsamp and Bdnf transcripts in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Significant strain differences in Lsamp expression were detected in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and thalamus that could be related to the different behavioral phenotype of B6 and 129Sv mice. Our data provides further evidence that LSAMP is implicated in the hippocampal connectivity and plasticity thereby modulating adaptability in changing environments.

AB  - Current antidepressant treatments remain limited by poor efficacy and a slow onset of action. Increasing evidence demonstrates that enriched environment (EE) treatment can promote structural and behavioral plasticity in the brain and dampen stress-induced alterations of neuroplasticity. Here, we have examined whether short term exposure to EE is able to produce antidepressant-like effects. Our results show that housing adult mice in an EE cage for 7 days led to antidepressant-like behavioral profiles and a significant increase in the number of dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These EE-induced antidepressant-like effects are primarily attributed to increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression through a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha)-mediated transcriptional mechanism. Blockade of HIF-1 alpha synthesis by lentiviral infection with HIF-1 alpha small hairpin RNAs completely blocked the increase in expression of VEGF and the antidepressant-like effects induced by EE. Moreover, no significant antidepressant-like effects were observed with EE treatment in VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1) knock-out mice. The increase in HIF-1 alpha expression in the hippocampus induced by EE was associated with a decrease in endogenous levels of microRNA-107 (miR-107). Overexpression of miR-107 in the hippocampus completely blocked EE-induced HIF-1 alpha expression and the antidepressant-like effects. These results support a model in which the down-regulation of miR-107, acting through HIF-1 alpha, mediates VEGF-dependent spinogenesis to underlie the EE-induced antidepressant-like effects.

AB  - Epigenetic regulation plays an important role in gene regulation, and epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation and histone modifications are generally described as switches that regulate gene expression. Behavioral epigenetics is defined as the study of how epigenetic alterations induced by experience and environmental stress may affect animal behavior. It studies epigenetic alterations due to environmental enrichment. Generally, molecular processes underlying epigenetic regulation in behavioral epigenetics include DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, noncoding RNA activity, and other unknown molecular processes. Whether the inheritance of epigenetic features will occur is a crucial question. In general, the mechanism underlying inheritance can be explained by two main phenomena: Germline-mediated epigenetic inheritance and interact epigenetic inheritance of somatic cells through germline. In this review, we focus on examining behavioral epigenetics based on its possible modes of inheritance and discuss the considerations in the research of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance.

AB  - Novel targets for depression and anxiety disorders are necessary for the development of more effective pharmacotherapeutics. Our previous study found that the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway is the signaling pathway most enhanced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, a region important for depression, anxiety, and addiction. Genetic manipulations of RA signaling in the NAc affecting addiction-related behavior prompted our study of the role of retinoic acid signaling in depression-related and anxiety-related behavior using in vivo RNA interference. Knockdown of the retinoic acid degradation enzyme cytochrome p450 family 26 subfamily b member 1 (Cyp26b1) in the nucleus accumbens shell increased depression-related behavior while decreasing anxiety-like behavior. Knockdown of the retinoic acid binding protein, cellular RA binding protein 2 (Crabp2), also increased depression-related behavior. Knockdown of another RA binding partner fatty acid binding protein 5 (Fabp5), did not alter these behaviors. These results further support the contention that RA signaling in the NAc shell can affect emotional behavior and that targeting some components of this pathway could be a promising avenue for developing novel treatments for depression and anxiety.

AB  - Enrichment programs may contribute to the quality of life and stress reduction in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) kept in zoos and aquaria. The results of these programs are generally positive in terms of welfare, but the magnitude of their effects may vary greatly between individuals of the same species, especially when the enrichment plans are based on the introduction of manipulative objects. Some animals will interact spontaneously with novel objects, even without food rewards and in the absence of the trainers, while others show no interest or even aversion toward the objects. To determine if formal training can improve these conditions, we measured the effects of an operant conditioning program in the manipulation of objects by dolphins that initially avoided them. This program took place between April and October 2013 at Zoomarine Portugal. Subjects were two female and two male bottlenose dolphins (adults with ages from 17 to 35 years) that after a preliminary analysis showed avoidance or low interest in the manipulation of various toys. The level of interaction with introduced enrichment objects was observed before and after formal training to explore the toys (sixteen 20-min observation sessions per animal "before" and "after training"). In all subjects, an index of interest in object manipulation, in the absence of trainers, increased significantly after the application of the training techniques. The results show that an initial reinforcement program focused on the manipulation of toys may overcome resistance, improving the effects of environmental enrichment plans, and it is a potentially useful strategy to increase the welfare of some captive animals.

AB  - Although experimental work on environmental enrichment has answered many important questions, it is not yet known whether beneficial effects of enrichment are more strongly influenced by regular provision of novel objects, or by the diversity of objects present at any one time. In a five-replicate study, 80 newly weaned male Wistar rats were housed in groups of four in: a 'novelty' condition (NC) in which five copies of the same object were provided in the home cage during the first week of the study followed by five copies of a different, novel, object over each of the next 4 weeks; a 'complexity' condition (CC) in which one example of each of the five objects used in NC was always present in the cage across the 5-week study period. Behaviour was collected in two 2-h sessions every week, once during the light phase of the light/dark cycle and once during the dark phase. Body weight and weight gain were measured over the five weeks and organ weights were recorded post-mortem. Rats in the CC displayed elevated levels of measures suggestive of improved welfare such as sleep, enrichment directed behaviour, enrichment contact, weight gain and relative thymus weight, and decreased levels of indicators denoting poor welfare including aggression, awake-non active and audible vocalizations. It appears that CC may have the potential to increase the frequency and diversity of behaviours, to express different types of behaviour when desired, and to augment the ability of the animals to exert some control over their environment, findings that may improve their welfare. Provision of novelty per se in the absence of diversity of objects at any one time seems to be less beneficial. Order (replicate) effects in the NC group indicated that responses of the animals towards the enrichment regimen appeared to depend on the type of object supplied, thus drawing attention to the importance of object characteristics when designing enrichment protocols for laboratory animals.

AB  - The study of human-animal interactions has provided insights into the welfare of many species. To date, however, research has largely focused on human relationships with captive mammals, with relatively little exploration of interactions between humans and other vertebrates, despite non-mammals constituting the vast majority of animals currently living under human management. With this study, we aimed to address this gap in knowledge by investigating human-fish interactions at a community garden/aquaponics learning-center that is home to approximately 150 goldfish (Carassius auratus) and seven adult and two juvenile koi (Cyprinus rubrofuscus). After a habituation period (July-September 2019) during which time the fish were regularly provided with the opportunity to engage with the researcher's submerged hand, but were not forced to interact with the researcher, we collected video data on 10 non-consecutive study days during the month of October. This procedure produced 18 similar to 20-min interaction sessions, 10 during T1 (when the experimenter first arrived and the fish had not been fed) and eight during T2 (20-30 min after the fish had been fed to satiation; two sessions of which were lost due equipment malfunction). Interactions between the researcher and the seven adult koi were coded from video based on location (within reach, on the periphery, or out of reach from the researcher) and instances of physical, tactile interaction. Analyses revealed that overall, koi spent more time than expected within reach of the researcher during both T1 (p < 0.02) and T2 (p < 0.03). There were also substantial differences between individuals' overall propensity for being within-reach and engaging in physical interaction. These results show that koi will voluntarily interact with humans and that individual koi display unique and consistent patterns of interaction. By providing quantitative data to support anecdotal claims that such relationships exist around the world, this research contributes to the ongoing discoveries highlighting the profound dissonance between how humans think about and treat fish and who fish actually are, thereby emphasizing the necessity of stronger moral and legal protections for fishes.

AB  - Weaning of piglets in commercial husbandry systems is earlier and more abrupt than would happen under natural conditions, resulting in low feed intakes and health and welfare problems in the immediate postweaning period. Piglets in commercial systems generally have limited opportunities to learn how to behave and eat like a pig. Interacting more with the sow, as well as providing enrichment, may stimulate the development of social and foraging related behaviours, and make piglets better able to adapt to the postweaning situation. Piglets were housed in a barren or enriched pen with a confined or loose-housed sow preweaning, and at weaning at cl 29 were relocated to a barren or enriched pen postweaning (2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, eight treatments, eight pens per treatments, four pigs per pen). Enrichment consisted of increased space allowance, straw, wood shavings, peat and branches. Behaviour was recorded on 4 days pre-(weekly) and postweaning (d 1, 5,9 and 12).
   The development of social behaviours and foraging related behaviours was positively affected by enrichment of the lactation pen, but less by sow housing. Postweaning behaviour was most strongly affected by postweaning enrichment, with enriched housed piglets showing higher levels of exploratory behaviours (27% versus 10% of observations), lower levels of belly nosing (0.1% versus 1.0%) and manipulative behaviours (0.2% versus 1.5%), but also less time spent eating (8% versus 9%) than piglets in barren postweaning pens. Piglets from loose-housed sows showed lower levels of belly nosing (0.3% versus 0.7%) and manipulative behaviour (0.8% versus 0.9%), as well as more chewing (6.1% versus 5.5%), food exploration (1.0% versus 0.8%) and play behaviour (0.9% versus 0.7%) postweaning than piglets from confined sows. Enrichment of the lactation pen in itself had few effects on postweaning behaviour, but interacted strongly with postweaning enrichment and sow housing, with piglets from a loose-housed sow switching from a barren to enriched environment showing high levels of play behaviour while piglets from a confined sow switching from an enriched to a barren environment showed high levels of belly nosing and low levels of play (barren-loose-enriched: 1.8% of observations, enriched-confined-barren: 0.1% of observations).
   Enrichment pre- and postweaning, as well as providing more possibilities to interact with the sow, can thus positively affect how piglet behaviour develops before weaning and how they adapt after weaning. It is important to realize that the preweaning environment, including sow housing, affects how piglets value their postweaning environment and may thus greatly affect piglet welfare around weaning.

AB  - Major depression is a stress-linked disease with significant morbidity and the anesthetic drug ketamine is of growing interest in the treatment of depression, since in responsive individuals a single dose has rapid (within hours) antidepressant effects that can be sustained for over a week in some instances. This combination of fast action and a therapeutic effect that lasts far beyond the drug's half-life points to a unique mechanism of action. In this reverse translational study, we investigate the degree to which ketamine counteracts stress-related depression-like behavioral responses by determining whether it affects unstressed animals similarly to stressed mice. To test this, male C57BL/6J mice were given a single injection of vehicle (0.9% saline; i.p.), 10 mg/kg ketamine, or 30 mg/kg ketamine, and were tested in the forced swim test (FST) 24 hours and 7 days later, as well as in the open field test on the eighth day. Unstressed mice had normal group housing, environmental enrichment, and experimenter pre-handling (5 days), whereas stressed animals were subjected to chronic mild stress (single housing, reduced enrichment and minimal handling), where some mice also had daily two-week unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). We find that ketamine (24 hours post-injection) decreases immobility and increases mobile (swimming) behavior (antidepressant-like effects) in UCS animals but does the opposite in unstressed mice, similar to recent human findings. In summary, these data suggest that chronic psychological stress interacts with ketamine treatment to modulate its effects in the C57BL/6J mouse FST, which reinforces the relevance of this test, and this strain of mice, to human, stress-induced depression.

AB  - Selection for indirect genetic effects (IGE), i.e. the genetic effect of an individual on a trait of another individual, is a promising avenue to increase trait values in plant and animal breeding. Studies in livestock suggest that selection for IGE for growth (IGEg) might increase animals' capacity to tolerate stress. We assessed the effect of a stressful phase (weaning) on the behaviour and performance of pigs (n = 480) divergently selected for high or low IGEg. High IGEg pigs were significantly slower to explore the feed and gained less weight than low IGEg pigs in the days after weaning. In line with previous findings, high IGEg animals may have prioritized the formation of social ranks.

AB  - Elevated alcohol intake after abstinence is a key feature of the addiction process. Some studies have shown that environmental enrichment (EE) affects ethanol intake and other reinforcing effects. However, different EE protocols may vary in their ability to influence alcohol consumption and stress-induced intake. The present study evaluated whether short (3 h) or continuous (24 h) EE protocols affect ethanol consumption after periods of withdrawal. Mice were challenged with stressful stimuli (24 h isolation and restraint stress) to evaluate the effects of stress on drinking. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a two-bottle choice drinking-in-the-dark paradigm for 15 days (20% ethanol and water, 2 h/day, acquisition phase). Control mice were housed under standard conditions (SC). In the first experiment, one group of mice was housed under EE conditions 24 h/day (EE24h). In the second experiment, the exposure to EE was reduced to 3 h/day (EE3h). After the acquisition phase, the animals were deprived of ethanol for 6 days, followed by 2 h ethanol access once a week. Animals were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) during ethanol withdrawal. During the last 2 weeks, the mice were exposed to 24 h ethanol access. A 1-h restraint stress test was performed immediately before the last ethanol exposure. EE24h but not EE3h increased anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal compared to controls. Neither EE24h nor EE3h affected ethanol consumption during the 2 h weekly exposure periods. However, EE24h and EE3h mice that were exposed to acute restraint stress consumed less ethanol than controls during a 24 h ethanol access. These results showed that EE reduces alcohol intake after an acute restraint stress.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety are reported in patients with Huntington's disease (HD). Recent studies suggest beneficial effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on HD progression possibly through the serotonergic system. We investigated the potential effectiveness of EE in correcting the affective-like phenotype of female R6/1 HD mice. In addition to a behavioural battery of tests assessing depression and anxiety-related endophenotypes, we recorded physiological measures, including body temperature regulation and defecation rate as indices of stress reactivity. Finally, following identification of changes in serotonin (5-HT) receptor gene expression we measured the function of 5-HT1A auto- and hetero-receptors. We found that 8-week-old female HD mice exhibited higher immobility time in the forced swimming test and a decreased preference for saccharin solution. EE did not correct those depressive-like behaviours but reduced anxiety-related measures in unconditioned approach/avoidance conflict situations. Defecation rate in a large open field and change in temperature during exposure to the tail suspension test were both enhanced in HD compared to wild-type animals. Despite the enhanced hypothermic response to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT exhibited by HD mice, we found a reduction in 5-HT1A receptor-mediated stimulation of [35S]GTP-?-S binding in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the hippocampus of HD animals. EE did not change 5-HT1A receptor function. Our data suggest that early EE has beneficial effects on the anxiety-like, but not on depression-like, behaviours in HD. This is the first evidence that these affective endophenotypes can be dissociated via this form of environmental stimulation. As 5-HT1A receptor dysfunction was not affected by EE, this receptor is unlikely to underlie the anxiety-related phenotype of HD. However, the specific regulatory role of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor in mediating depressive-like behaviour in HD remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, by comparing in vivo and in vitro results, our findings suggest that 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia could be mediated by other targets besides the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, including hippocampal 5-HT7 receptors.

AB  - Mink are potentially ideal for investigating the functions of play: deleterious effects of early social isolation suggest a crucial developmental role for play; and huge numbers of highly playful juvenile subjects can be studied on farms. We collected descriptive data on 186 pairs from 93 litters, half provided with play-eliciting environmental enrichment objects in their home cages, to test three hypotheses: (1) play frequency is subject to litter effects; (2) relative playfulness is stable over time; (3) play sub-types share a single, common motivational basis. We found weak litter effects that were driven by stronger litter effects on general activity, and weakly stable individual differences in both total and rough-and-tumble play. Experimentally increasing object play did not inhibit rough-and-tumble play, showing these sub-types are not motivational substitutes. Frequencies of these sub-types were also uncorrelated, and changed differently with time of day and age, further supporting this conclusion.

AB  - In recent years, both major depression and antidepressant therapy have been linked to adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The hippocampus is not a homogeneous brain area, and a converging body of evidence indicates a functional dissociation along its septo-temporal axis, the dorsal part being involved more in learning/memory and spatial navigation, while the ventral sub-region is linked more to emotional behavior and regulation of the neuroendocrine stress axis. Research has therefore been conducted in an attempt to relate effects of models of depression and of antidepressant therapies to adult neurogenesis along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. The present paper reviews the current literature addressing this question and discusses the possible mechanisms involved and the functional significance of such regional effects. This review shows that animal models of depression elicit an effect restricted to the ventral hippocampus more frequently than a dorsal-specific effect. However, this is also stage specific, and concerns neurogenesis, rather than cell proliferation or survival. Surprisingly, the same does not apply regarding the effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors that act in a more uniform way on dorsal and ventral adult neurogenesis in most studies. Some recently introduced clinical compounds (e.g., agomelatine) or putative antidepressants have a specific action on the ventral sub-region, indicating that an action restricted to this part of the brain may be sufficient to achieve remission. Finally, non-pharmacological manipulations that are also endowed with antidepressant effects, such as environmental enrichment or physical exercise, also act on both subdivisions, although some studies pointed to specificity of dorsal neurogenesis. The different treatments, acting either on the dorsal or on the ventral sub-regions, could promote recovery by improving either ventral-or dorsal-related functions, both contributing in a different way to treatment efficacy.

AB  - Enteromorpha compressa is the dominant species in coastal areas of northern Chile receiving copper mine wastes. Copper remains as the main heavy metal in these coastal waters and it is accumulated in E. compressa growing at the impacted sites. Algae from these sites showed higher levels of lipoperoxides than from non-impacted sites, which suggests the occurrence of cellular damage resulting from oxidative stress. The strong activation of ascorbate peroxidase detected in this study probably occurs in order to buffer this oxidative stress. Unexpectedly, the activity of glutathione reductase, normally coupled to ascorbate peroxidase activity, was not affected by the chronic exposure to the mine wastes. Moreover, catalase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione peroxidase, commonly reported to buffer oxidative stress in plants and algae, were not detected in E. compressa from any of the studied sites. Levels of total glutathione and phenolic compounds decreased in algae from mine-impacted sites. In contrast, high levels of dehydroascorbate were found in algae from impacted sites, whereas ascorbate remained unchanged. Therefore, it is suggested that E. compressa tolerates a copper-enriched environment, and the accompanying oxidative stress, through the accumulation of copper, activation of ascorbate peroxidase, synthesis of ascorbate ( accumulated as dehydroascorbate) and consumption of glutathione and water-soluble phenolic compounds.

AB  - Early life stressful events have detrimental effects on the brain and behavior, which are associated with the development of depression. Immune-inflammatory responses have been reported to contribute in the pathophysiology of depression. Many studies have reported on the beneficial effects of exercise against stress. However, underlying mechanisms through which exercise exerts its effects were poorly studied. Therefore, it applied maternal separation (MS), as a valid animal model of early-life adversity, in rats from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 14 for 180 min per day. At PND 28, male Wistar albino rats were subjected to 5 experimental groups; 1) controls 2) MS rats 3) MS rats treated with fluoxetine 5 mg/kg to PND 60, 4) MS rats that were subjected to voluntary running wheel (RW) exercise and 5) MS rats that were subjected to mandatory treadmill (TM) exercise until adulthood. At PND 60, depressive-like behaviors were assessed by using forced swimming test (FST), splash test, and sucrose preference test (SPT). Our results revealed that depressive-like behaviors following MS stress were associated with an increase in expression of toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr-4) and its main signaling protein, Myd88, in the hippocampal formation. Also, we found that voluntary (and not mandatory) physical exercise during adolescence is protected against depressant effects of early-life stress at least partly through mitigating the innate immune responses in the hippocampus.

AB  - During the past decades, the study of "animal personalities" has gained increasing importance in the field of behavioural and evolutionary ecology, thereby contributing to a focus shift from the population to the individual in various research disciplines. Against this background, the overall idea of the present review is to transfer the personality concept from behavioural ecology to animal welfare science, to discuss the role of the individual in different research approaches and to pave new grounds for a more individual-tailored assessment and treatment of welfare-related problems. Moreover, we will explicitly refer to welfare issues "beyond the average", thereby addressing problems that are not entirely covered by simply studying personality traits in animal welfare research. By combining two different fields, we hope to stimulate more theoretical and empirical work on this topic to find new ways of improving the welfare of animals in human hands even at the individual level.

AB  - Over the past decades, the influence of parental care on offspring development has been a topic of extensive research in both human and animal models. Rodent models offer several unique advantages over human studies, allowing for higher levels of environmental control, exploration of interventions, genetic control and examination of underlying neurobiological mechanisms in greater spatiotemporal detail. Although exploitation of these opportunities has led to increased understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to the early-life environment, translation of results to human parenting and child development appears to be challenging. Attuning animal models to the human situation and application of novel structural and functional techniques is therefore of crucial importance to reduce the gap between rodent and human research.

AB  - Animal welfare assessment relies on valid and practical indicators of affect. In mice, the most widely used research vertebrates, lying still with eyes open, inactive-but-awake (IBA) in the home cage, has potential to be one such indicator. IBA is elevated in barren, conventional housing compared with well-resourced, enriched housing, and predicts immobility in Forced Swim Tests, a common measure of 'helplessness' in depression research. In Experiment 1, using females from three strains (C57BL/6, Balb/c and DBA/2), we first replicated past findings, confirming higher levels of IBA in conventional cages and a positive relationship between IBA and helplessness. We then extended this research to three other signs of depression: changes in weight and sleep, and reduced hippocampal volume. Here, IBA positively covaried with body mass index, with sleep in DBA/2s and conventionally housed BALB/cs, and negatively covaried with hippocampal volume in conventionally housed C57BL/6s. In Experiment 2, we sought to refine the phenotype of IBA to improve its accuracy as a welfare indicator. Here, scoring IBA performed in hunched postures appeared to improve its accuracy as an indicator in Balb/c mice. Additional research is now needed to further refine the phenotype of IBA and to confirm whether it reflects states consistent with depression, or instead other underlying poor welfare conditions.

AB  - The role of natural variations in pre-weaning litter size in rodent adult emotionality and the importance of maternal care as a possible mediating factor have been frequently neglected. To address these issues, maternal behaviour of Sprague-Dawley dams differing in natural number of pups was studied for the first seven postnatal days. Later, adult behaviour of representative male offspring was studied in the elevated plus-maze, the circular corridor, the dark-light box and the forced swimming test. Three groups of offspring were selected in function of the number of littermates: L < 10 group (less than 10 pups per dam), L10-15 (between 10 and 15 pups per dam) and L > 15 group (more than 15 pups per dam). L < 10 litters showed a reduced habituation of activity across time in a circular corridor and as compared to L > 15 litters, L < 10 litters showed a lower activity during the first 5 min of exposure to the circular corridor. L < 10 litters had also higher signs of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze, in comparison to the other two groups. In addition, L < 10 litters showed in the forced swimming test reduced struggling and more mild swimming behavior than the other two groups. These abnormalities in L < 10 litters are not explained by maternal behavior since they received individually more maternal care than L > 15, as assessed by total licking-grooming observed during the whole observation period divided by number of pups. Although previous data from several laboratories have demonstrated that low maternal care is associated with heightened emotionality at adulthood, the present results suggest an important contribution of spontaneous litter size to adult emotional behavior that cannot be explained by concomitant changes in maternal care.

AB  - Characterization of piglets based on the degree of resistance they display in a so-called Backtest is, to a certain extent, predictive of their coping responses to several challenges in later life. It is unknown, however, whether these individual coping characteristics of pigs are also reflected in their behavioural development in different environments. The present study investigated the behavioural development of pigs with diverging Backtest responses, high-resisting (HR) and low-resisting (LR) pigs, in both barren housing and housing enriched with straw bedding. During the suckling period, pigs were subjected to the Backtest. Pigs classified as HR (n = 30) or LR (n = 30) were selected and after weaning housed in groups of six (three LR and three HR) in either barren or enriched pens. Home pen behaviour was recorded at 5, 9, 15 and 19 weeks of age for 8 h per week using 2-min instantaneous scan sampling. Housing environment markedly influenced behaviour of pigs. Barren housed pigs were less active, showed less explorative and play behaviour, and spent more time on oral activities directed at pen mates than pigs from enriched housing. HR pigs showed more aggressive behaviour than LR pigs and they tended to be less active in both environments, LR pigs spent more time on manipulating pen mates, in particular in barren housing, In addition, they played more than HR pigs in enriched pens. In conclusion, an enriched housing environment, i.e, availability of straw bedding, appeared to improve welfare as it increased play behaviour and decreased Manipulative oral behaviour directed at pen mates in comparison with barren housing conditions, Individual coping characteristics sties of pigs. as assessed in the Backtest, were also reflected in their home pen behaviour Notably. the effects of housing on both manipulative and play behaviour were most obvious in LR pigs, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Developmental differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness to stressors and ongoing development of glucocorticoid-sensitive brain regions in adolescence suggest that similar to the neonatal period of ontogeny, adolescence may also be a sensitive period for programming effects of stressors on the central nervous system. Although research on this period of life is scarce compared to early life and adulthood, the available research indicates that effects of stress exposure during adolescence differ from, and may be longer-lasting than, effects of the same stress exposure in adulthood. Research progress in animal models in this field is reviewed including HPA function and the enduring effects of stress exposures in adolescence on sensitivity to drugs of abuse, learning and memory, and emotional behaviour in adulthood. The effects of adolescent stress depend on a number of factors, including the age, gender, the duration of stress exposure, the type of stressor, and the time between stress exposure and testing.

AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of farmers are choosing to keep their cows indoors throughout the year. Indoor housing of cows allows farmers to provide high-yielding individuals with a nutritionally balanced diet fit for their needs, and it has important welfare benefits for both cows and their calves, such as protection from predators, parasites, and exposure to extreme weather conditions. However, it also confronts cows and calves with a wide range of environmental challenges. These include abiotic environmental sources of stress (e.g., exposure to loud and aversive sound) and confinement-specific stressors (e.g., restricted movement and maintenance in abnormal social groups). Cows and calves that live indoors are also faced with the challenge of occupying long periods with a limited range of possible behavioral patterns. Environmental enrichment can improve biological functioning (measured as increased lifetime reproductive success, increased inclusive fitness, or a correlate of these such as improved health), help animals to cope with stressors in their surroundings, reduce frustration, increase the fulfillment of behavioral needs, and promote more positive affective states. Here, we review recent findings on the effect of social, occupational, physical, sensory, and nutritional enrichment on dairy cows and calves, and we assess the appropriateness and practicality of implementing different enrichment practices on commercial dairy farms. Some of the enrichment methods reviewed here may also be applied to those more extensive cattle-raising systems, where similar challenges occur.

AB  - The 7th World Congress of Neurorehabilitation was held from 16-19 May, 2012, in Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne produced the largest attendance of any meeting thus far for this biennial congress of the World Federation of Neurorehabilitation. The congress provided a diverse range of presentations, from environmental interventions in animal models of brain disorders, to new techniques for rehabilitation and clinical trials. While stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury featured prominently, there were also many other presentations on rehabilitation for neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders. Here, we focus on a selection of novel findings reported at this congress.

AB  - There is evidence that depression may have a different neural basis at different ages. Although chronic stress and elevated glucocorticoid levels have been demonstrated to lead to the emergence of mood disorders, it remains unclear how moderate elevation of glucocorticoid levels in young animals influences depression-like behaviors and brain functions. To address this issue, the present study examines how chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration during adolescence and early adulthood influences depression-like behaviors, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response and hippocampal cell proliferation. Male mice were chronically administrated with CORT drinking water (20 mg/L) during adolescence. After two months of treatment, serum CORT levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay. Hippocampal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors were characterized using Western blot. Tail suspension and forced swim tests were used to assess depression-related behaviors in mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed to measure bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in order to assess cell proliferation in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that chronic CORT administration induced a mild but not significant elevation in basal CORT levels and attenuated the physiological responses to stress. Chronic CORT administration also reduced expression of the hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor and decreased immobility time in both the tail suspension test and the forced swim test. Moreover, chronic CORT administration increased the BrdU immunoreactivities in the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic mild elevation by CORT administration during the adolescence and early adulthood attenuates depression-like behaviors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rearing in an enriched environment (ENR) is known to enhance cognitive and memory abilities in rodents, whereas social isolation (ISO) induces depression-like behaviour. The hippocampus has been documented to undergo morphological and functional changes depending on these rearing environments. For example, rearing condition during juvenility alters CA1 stratum radiatum gamma oscillation power in rats. In the present study, hippocampal CA1 local field potentials (LFP) were recorded from bilateral CA1 in urethane-anaesthetized mice that were reared in either an ENR or ISO condition. Similar to previous findings in rats, gamma oscillation power during theta states was higher in the ENR group. Ripple events that occur during non-theta periods in the CA1 stratum pyramidale also had longer intervals in ISO mice. Because astrocytic Ca2+ elevations play a key role in synaptic plasticity, we next tested whether these changes in LFP are also expressed in inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2 (IP(3)R2)-knockout (KO) mice, in which astrocytic Ca2+ elevations are largely diminished. We found that the gamma power was also higher in IP(3)R2-KO-ENR mice compared to IP(3)R2-KO-ISO mice, suggesting that the rearing-environment-dependent gamma power alteration does not necessarily require the astrocytic IP3/Ca2+ pathway. By contrast, ripple events showed genotype-dependent changes, as well as rearing condition-dependent changes: ISO housing and IP(3)R2 deficiency both lead to longer inter-ripple intervals. Moreover, we found that ripple magnitude in the right CA1 tended to be smaller in IP(3)R2-KO. Because IP(3)R2-KO mice have been reported to have depression phenotypes, our results suggest that ripple events and the mood of animals may be broadly correlated.

AB  - It has been shown previously (Sotnikov et al., 2011) that mice selectively inbred for high anxiety-related behavior (HAB) vs. low anxiety-related behavior in the elevated plus maze differentially respond to trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a synthetic fox fecal odor. However, less is known about whether environmental factors can rescue these extreme phenotypes. Here, we found that an enriched environment (EE) provided during early adolescence induced anxiolytic effects in HAB (HAB-EE) mice, rescuing their strong avoidance behavior induced by TMT. In a series of experiments, the contribution of maternal, juvenile and adolescent behavior to the anxiolytic effects elicited by EE was investigated. At the molecular level, using c-fos expression mapping, we found that the activity of the medial and basolateral amygdala was significantly reduced in HAB-EE mice after TMT exposure. We further analysed the expression of Crhr1, as its amount in the amygdala has been reported to be important for the regulation of anxiety-related behavior after EE. Indeed, in situ hybridisation indicated significantly decreased Crhr1 expression in the basolateral and central amygdala of HAB-EE mice. To further test the involvement of Crhr1 in TMT-induced avoidance, we exposed conditional glutamatergic-specific Crhr1-knockout mice to the odor. The behavioral response of Crhr1-knockout mice mimicked that of HAB-EE mice, and c-fos expression in the amygdala after TMT exposure was significantly lower compared with controls, thereby further supporting a critical involvement of Crhr1 in environmentally-induced anxiolysis. Altogether, our results indicate that EE can rescue strong avoidance of TMT by HAB mice with Crhr1 expression in the amygdala being critically involved.

AB  - Regulation of neuroinflammation by glial cells plays a major role in the pathophysiology of major depression. While astrocyte involvement has been well described, the role of microglia is still elusive. Recently, we have shown that Adiponectin (ApN) plays a crucial role in the anxiolytic/antidepressant neurogenesis-independent effects of enriched environment (EE) in mice; however its mechanisms of action within the brain remain unknown. Here, we show that in a murine model of depression induced by chronic corticosterone administration, the hippocampus and the hypothalamus display increased levels of inflammatory cytokines mRNA, which is reversed by EE housing. By combining flow cytometry, cell sorting and q-PCR, we show that microglia from depressive-like mice adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by higher expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and I kappa B-alpha mRNAs. EE housing blocks pro-inflammatory cytokine gene induction and promotes arginase 1 mRNA expression in brain-sorted microglia, indicating that EE favors an anti-inflammatory activation state. We show that microglia and brain-macrophages from corticosterone-treated mice adopt differential expression profiles for CCR2, MHC class II and IL-4rec alpha surface markers depending on whether the mice are kept in standard environment or EE. Interestingly, the effects of EE were abolished when cells are isolated from ApN knock-out mouse brains. When injected intra-cerebroventricularly, ApN, whose level is specifically increased in cerebrospinal fluid of depressive mice raised in EE, rescues microglia phenotype, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production by microglia and blocks depressive-like behavior in corticosterone-treated mice. Our data suggest that EE-induced ApN increase within the brain regulates microglia and brain macrophages phenotype and activation state, thus reducing neuroinflammation and depressive-like behaviors in mice.

AB  - Progress in improving the welfare of captive animals has been hindered by a lack of objective indicators to assess the quality of lifetime experience, often called cumulative affective experience. Recent developments in stress biology and psychiatry have shed new light on the role of the mammalian hippocampus in affective processes. Here we review these findings and argue that structural hippocampal biomarkers demonstrate criterion, construct and content validity as indicators of cumulative affective experience in mammals. We also briefly review emerging findings in birds and fish, which have promising implications for applying the hippocampal approach to these taxa, but require further validation. We hope that this review will motivate welfare researchers and neuroscientists to explore the potential of hippocampal biomarkers of cumulative affective experience.

AB  - The Swiss sublines of Roman High-(RHA/Verh) and Low-(RLA/Verh) Avoidance rats have been genetically selected (and outbred) since 1972 because of their good versus extremely poor acquisition of two-way, active avoidance. Inbred strains (RHA-I and RLA-I), derived front those two lines, have been maintained at our laboratory since 1997. The RLA line/strain shows increased stress-induced endocrine responses and enhanced anxiety/fearfulness in a variety of unconditioned behavioural variables and tests. Thus far, however, the Roman rat strains have not been compared in procedures involving classical fear conditioning to cues or contexts. Therefore, the present work was aimed at comparing RHA-I and RLA-I rats in 1) two different procedures of fear-potentiated startle and 2) in a classical fear conditioning (i.e., conditioned freezing) paradigm. The results indicate that, compared to RHA-I rats, RLA-I animals display higher levels of conditioned fear (as measured either by startle responses or freezing behavior) across those different tasks.

AB  - The transcription factorTCF4was confirmed in several large genome-wide association studies as one of the most significant schizophrenia (SZ) susceptibility genes. Transgenic mice moderately overexpressingTcf4in forebrain (Tcf4tg) display deficits in fear memory and sensorimotor gating. As second hit, we exposedTcf4tg animals to isolation rearing (IR), chronic social defeat (SD), enriched environment (EE), or handling control (HC) conditions and examined mice with heterozygous deletion of the exon 4 (Tcf4Ex4 delta(+/-)) to unravel gene-dosage effects. We applied multivariate statistics for behavioral profiling and demonstrate that IR and SD cause strong cognitive deficits ofTcf4tg mice, whereas EE masked the genetic vulnerability. We observed enhanced long-term depression inTcf4tg mice and enhanced long-term potentiation inTcf4Ex4 delta(+/-)mice indicating specific gene-dosage effects.Tcf4tg mice showed higher density of immature spines during development as assessed by STED nanoscopy and proteomic analyses of synaptosomes revealed concurrently increased levels of proteins involved in synaptic function and metabolic pathways. We conclude that environmental stress and Tcf4 misexpression precipitate cognitive deficits in 2-hit mouse models of relevance for schizophrenia.

In order to pursue the potential clinical translation of this approach, the effects of somatic NPY gene transfer on other hippocampal functions need to be assessed. The present study characterized the behavioral effects of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-mediated hippocampal NPY overexpression in adult mate mice and also Y1 receptor knockout mice. In wild-type mice, there were no obvious adverse effects on the general health, motor function and cognition following rAAV-NPY treatment. Moreover, hippocampal NPY overexpression induced a moderate anxiolytic effect in the open field test and elevated plus maze. Intriguingly, the treatment also increased depressive-like behavior in the tail suspension test. Elevated hippocampal NPY levels in the absence of Y1 signalling had no effects on anxiety or cognition and actually improved the depressive-like phenotype observed in the wild-type mice treated with rAAV-NPY.

AB  - Animal welfare depends on the possibility to express species-specific behaviours and can be strongly compromised in socially and environmentally deprived conditions. Nesting materials and refuges are very important resources to express these behaviours and should be considered as housing supplementation items. We evaluated the effects of one item of housing supplementation in standard settings in laboratory mice. C57BL/6JOlaHsd (B6) and BALB/cOlaHsd (BALB) young male and female mice, upon arrival, were housed in groups of four in standard laboratory cages and after 10 days of acclimatization, a red transparent plastic triangular-shaped Mouse House (TM) was introduced into half of the home cages. Animals with or without a mouse house were observed in various contexts for more than one month. Body weight gain and food intake, home cage behaviours, emotionality and response to standard cage changing procedures were evaluated. The presence of a mouse house in the home cage did not interfere with main developmental and behavioural parameters or emotionality of BALB and B6 male and female mice compared with controls. Both strains habituated to the mouse house in about a week, but made use of it differently, with BALB mice using the house more than the B6 strain. Our results suggest that mice habituated to the mouse house rather quickly without disrupting their home cage activities. Scientists can thus be encouraged to use mouse houses, also in view of the implementation of the EU Directive (2010/63/EU).

AB  - Social behavior represents a beneficial interaction between conspecifics that is critical for maintaining health and wellbeing. Dysfunctional or poor social interaction are associated with increased risk of physical (e.g., vascular) and psychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, and substance abuse). Although the impact of negative and positive social interactions is well-studied, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Zebrafish have well-characterized social behavior phenotypes, high genetic homology with humans, relative experimental simplicity and the potential for high-throughput screens. Here, we discuss the use of zebrafish as a candidate model organism for studying the fundamental mechanisms underlying social interactions, as well as potential impacts of social isolation on human health and wellbeing. Overall, the growing utility of zebrafish models may improve our understanding of how the presence and absence of social interactions can differentially modulate various molecular and physiological biomarkers, as well as a wide range of other behaviors.

AB  - Recent evidence now suggests the involvement of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system in mood disorders. Specifically, several members of the FGF family have been shown to be dysregulated in individuals with major depression. In this review, we will introduce the FGF system in terms of structure and function during development, in adulthood, and in various regions and cell types. We will also review the FGF system as a mediator of neural plasticity. Furthermore, this review will summarize animal as well as human studies. The majority of animal studies have focused on stress, environmental enrichment, pharmacological manipulations, and the hippocampus. By contrast, human studies have focused on volumetric measurements, antidepressant literature, and, most recently, post-mortem microarray experiments. In summary, a reduced tone in the FGFsystem might alter brain development or remodeling and result in a predisposition or vulnerability to mood disorders, including major depression.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to have powerful beneficial effects on a variety of physiological and pathological processes Accumulating evidence indicates that EE can mimic positive life experiences and prevent the development of drug addiction More recently EE has also been shown to eliminate already developed addiction-related behaviors and to reduce the risks of relapse These preventive and curative effects of EE are associated with dramatic plastic changes in several brain areas such as the hippocampus the frontal cortex and the striatum EE alters neurotransmitter systems produces changes in gene expression and transcription factors induces chromatin rearrangement and stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis Here we review the existent literature on behavioral neurochemical cellular and molecular effects of EE and we discuss different possible ways in which EE-induced neuroadaptations result in decreased vulnerability to addiction and relapse We propose a unified theoretical framework in which EE is seen as a functional opposite of stress On the one hand the antistress effects of EE would reduce the reinforcing effects of drugs and their ability to induce long-lasting neuroplastic changes and thus they would prevent the development of drug addiction On the other hand permanent or transient restoration of the normal pre-drug functioning of the stress system would facilitate resisting prepotent desire to take drug and it would decrease the risks of relapse This theoretical framework highlights the importance of stress in each phase of drug addiction and strongly suggests that life conditions of abstinent addicts should be considered as part of their treatment (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Pigs living in intensive husbandry systems may experience both acute and chronic stress through standard management procedures and limitations in their physical and social environment, which may have implications for their immune status. Here, the effect of a new breeding method where pigs were selected on their heritable influence on their pen mates' growth, and environmental enrichment on the immune status of pigs was investigated. Hereto, 240 pigs with a relatively positive genetic effect on the growth of their pen mates (+SBV) and 240 pigs with a relatively negative genetic effect on the growth of their pen mates (-SBV) were housed in barren or straw-enriched pens from 4 to 23 weeks of age (n = 80 pens in total). A blood sample was taken from the pigs before, three days after a 24 h regrouping test, and at week 22. In addition, effects of coping style, as assessed in a backtest, and gender were also investigated. Mainly, +SBV were found to have lower leukocyte, lymphocyte and haptoglobin concentrations than -SBV pigs. Enriched housed pigs had a lower neutrophil to lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and lower haptoglobin concentrations, but had higher antibody titers specific for Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) than barren housed pigs. No interactions were found between SBV class and housing. Furthermore, pigs with a proactive coping style had higher alternative complement activity and, in the enriched pens, higher antibody titers specific for KLH than pigs with a reactive coping style. Lastly, females tended to have lower leukocyte, but higher haptoglobin concentrations than castrated males. Overall, these results suggest that +SBV pigs and enriched housed pigs were less affected by stress than -SBV and barren housed pigs, respectively. Moreover, immune activation might be differently organized in individuals with different coping styles and to a lesser extent in individuals of opposite genders.

AB  - The study of animal personality is a growing field that has applications for welfare of animals living in captive settings. We measured personality traits (activity, exploration, and neophobia) in Texas horned lizards (Phry-nosoma cornutum) living in human care before they were released to their natal habitat as part of a headstart program. We found evidence of consistent inter-individual differences in activity and exploration, but not neophobia. We also identified a positive correlation between activity and exploration, such that more active lizards were also more likely to explore a novel environment. These results suggest that Texas horned lizards have individual differences in response to their environment, which can inform husbandry decisions. Extensions of this work could also have implications for conservation of Texas horned lizards and for headstart programs focused on reptiles.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the modulation of the stress responses by the environmental conditions and its putative neurobiological mechanisms. For that an integrative study on the effects of environmental enrichment and isolation housing on (1) the corticosterone, dopamine and acetylcholine responses to acute restraint stress in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the awake rat; (2) the mRNA levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the PFC, and (3) the behavioral responses to stress, related to the PFC (habituation to a novel environment, spatial-working memory and inhibitory avoidance response) was performed. Male Wistar rats were maintained from 3 to 6 months of age in two different conditions: enriched (EC) or impoverished (IC). Animals were stereotaxically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae in the PFC to perform microdialysis experiments to evaluate the concentrations of corticosterone, dopamine and acetylcholine. EC animals showed lower increases of corticosterone and dopamine but not of acetylcholine than IC animals in the PFC in response to acute restraint stress (20 min). In the PFC, GR mRNA levels showed a trend towards an enhancement in EC animals. EC reduced the days to learn the spatial working memory task (radial-water maze). Spatial working memory, however, was not different between groups in either basal or stress conditions. Inhibitory avoidance response was reduced in EC rats. The changes produced by EC in the neurochemical, neuroendocrine and behavioral parameters evaluated suggest that EC rats could show a better coping during an acute stress challenge.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated a preventive effect of continuous environmental enrichment during early development on the vulnerability of rodents to drug addiction-related behaviors. Recently, it was demonstrated that a continuous environmental enrichment could eliminate already established addiction-related behaviors in mice. The present study compared the effects of intermittent or continuous exposure to novel stimuli during repeated amphetamine (Amp) treatment on the development of behavioral sensitization (an animal model of addiction-related neuroadaptations) in adult mice.
   Methods: Three-month-old male Swiss mice were treated with 2.5 mg/kg Amp every other day for 13 days in their home cages. Novel objects were presented in their home cages for 2 h on non-drug treatment days (experiment 1) or for 24 h/day during the 13 days of drug treatment (experiment 2). Seven days after the drug treatment had finished, the mice were challenged with 2.5 mg/kg Amp, and their locomotor activity was quantified in a familiar open field for 10 min.
   Results: Intermittent exposure to the novel objects did not modify the acute Amp locomotor stimulatory effect but potentiated the development of Amp-induced locomotor sensitization. This enhanced sensitization was due to increased locomotion in the central squares of the apparatus, which suggests anxiolysis or increased impulsiveness. Conversely, continuous exposure to the novel objects potentiated the acute Amp locomotor stimulatory effect and blunted the development of Amp-induced locomotor sensitization.
   Conclusions: We conclude that addiction-related behaviors can be differentially and critically modified depending on the schedule and period of the novelty exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scientists and laypeople have long expressed concern that animals in non-enriched, unchanging environments might experience boredom. However, this had attracted little empirical study: the state is difficult to assess without verbal self-reports, and spontaneous behavioural signs of boredom can vary in humans, making it hard to identify signs likely to be valid in other species. We operationally define boredom as a negative state induced by barren conditions that causes an increased, generalised interest in diverse stimuli. Previously, we demonstrated that this state existed in mink housed in non-enriched cages, compared to those in preferred, stress reducing enriched enclosures. Further, in some analyses this heightened interest in stimuli positively correlated with time spent lying still but awake, while negatively correlating with locomotor stereotypic behaviour. However, these results needed replication. The current study tested for the same effects, in a new cohort of 20 male mink, by presenting 11 stimuli ranging from those predicted to typically be aversive (e.g. predator cues) to those predicted to be rewarding (e.g. food rewards; moving objects to chase). Where housing treatments differed, non-enriched mink were again more interested in the stimuli presented, spending longer oriented towards and in contact with them (e.g. for aversive stimuli: F-1,F-9 = 6.27, p = 0.034 and F-1,F-9 = 8.24, p = 0.019, respectively). Lying still but awake again correlated with interest in the stimuli (shorter latencies to contact rewarding stimuli: F-1,F-17 = 3.70, p = 0.036; in enriched mink only, more time oriented to and in contact with all stimuli: F-1,F-8 = 9.49, p = 0.015 and F-1,F-8 = 15.9, p = 0.004). In contrast, the previous correlations with stereotypic behaviour were not replicated. We therefore conclude that mink housed in non-enriched cages likely experience boredom-like states, and that time spent lying still while awake could, at least in some types of housing, potentially be used as a cage-side indicator of these states. We also suggest how future researchers might address further fundamental and practical questions about animal boredom, in mink and other species.

AB  - Stress is a state of threatened homeostasis during which a variety of adaptive processes are activated to produce physiological and behavioral changes. Preclinical models are pivotal for understanding these physiological or pathophysiological changes in the body in response to stress. Furthermore, these models are also important for the development of novel pharmacological agents for stress management. The well described preclinical stress models include immobilization, restraint, electric foot shock and social isolation stress. Stress assessment in animals is done at the behavioral level using open field, social interaction, hole board test; at the biochemical level by measuring plasma corticosterone and ACTH; at the physiological level by measuring food intake, body weight, adrenal gland weight and gastric ulceration. Furthermore the comparison between different stressors including electric foot shock, immobilization and cold stressor is described in terms of intensity, hormonal release, protein changes in brain, adaptation and sleep pattern. This present review describes these preclinical stress protocols, and stress assessment at different levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mental illness is the leading cause of disability worldwide. We are only just beginning to reveal and comprehend the complex interaction that exists between the genetic makeup of an organism and the potential modifying effect of the environment in which it lives, and how this translates into mediating susceptibility to neurological and psychiatric conditions. The capacity to address this issue experimentally has been facilitated by the availability of rodent models which allow the precise manipulation of genetic and environmental factors. In this review, we discuss the valuable nature of animal models in furthering our understanding of the relationship between genetic and environmental factors in affective illnesses, such as anxiety and depressive disorders. We first highlight the behavioral impairments exhibited by genetically targeted animal models of affective disorders, and then provide a discussion of the underlying neurobiology, focusing on animal models that involve exposure to stress. This is followed by a review of recent studies that report of beneficial effects of environmental manipulations such as environmental enrichment and enhanced physical activity and discuss the likely mechanisms that mediate those benefits.

AB  - Coping with mild early life stress tends to make subsequent coping efforts more effective and therefore more likely to be used as a means of arousal regulation and resilience. Here we show that this developmental learning-like process of stress inoculation increases ventromedial prefrontal cortical volumes in peripubertal monkeys. Larger volumes do not reflect increased cortical thickness but instead represent surface area expansion of ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Expansion of ventromedial prefrontal cortex coincides with increased white matter myelination inferred from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. These findings suggest that the process of coping with early life stress increases prefrontal myelination and expands a region of cortex that broadly controls arousal regulation and resilience.

AB  - Humans exhibit a remarkable degree of resilience in the face of extreme stress, with most resisting the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Over the past 5 years, there has been increasing interest in the active, adaptive coping mechanisms of resilience; however, in humans, most published work focuses on correlative neuroendocrine markers that are associated with a resilient phenotype. In this review, we highlight a growing literature in rodents that is starting to complement the human work by identifying the active behavioral, neural, molecular and hormonal basis of resilience. The therapeutic implications of these findings are important and can pave the way for an innovative approach to drug development for a range of stress-related syndromes.

AB  - Although the metabolic cage is commonly used for housing nonhuman animals in the laboratory, it has been recognized as constituting a unique stressor. Such an environment would be expected to affect behavioral change in animals housed therein. However, few studies have specifically addressed the nature or magnitude of this change. The current study sought to characterize the behavioral time budget of rats in metabolic cage housing in comparison to that of individually housed animals in standard open-top cages. Rats in metabolic cages spent less time moving, manipulating enrichment, and carrying out rearing behaviors, and there was a corresponding shift toward inactivity. In an applied Social Interaction Test, behavioral scoring implied that metabolic cage housing had an anxiogenic effect. In conclusion, metabolic cage housing produces measurable effects on spontaneous and evoked behavior in rats in the laboratory. These behavioral changes may lead to a negative emotional state in these animals, which could have negative welfare consequences. Further research is needed to quantify the existence and magnitude of such an effect on rat well being.

AB  - Childhood trauma (CT) can have persistent effects on the brain and is one of the major risk factors for neuropsychiatric diseases in adulthood. Recent advances in the field of epigenetics suggest that epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as regulatory processes involving non-coding RNA are associated with the long-term sequelae of CT. This narrative review summarizes current knowledge on the epigenetic basis of CT and describes studies in animal models and human subjects examining how the epigenome and transcriptome are modified by CT in the brain. It discusses psychological and pharmacological interventions that can counteract epigenetic changes induced by CT and the need to establish longitudinal assessment after CT for developing more effective diagnostics and treatment strategies based on epigenetic targets.

AB  - People diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, addiction or schizophrenia often have dysregulated memory, mood, pattern separation and/or reward processing. These symptoms are indicative of a disrupted function of the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the brain, and they improve with treatment and remission. The dysfunction of the DG is accompanied by structural maladaptations, including dysregulation of adult-generated neurons. An increasing number of studies using modern inducible approaches to manipulate new neurons show that the behavioral symptoms in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders can be produced or exacerbated by the inhibition of DG neurogenesis. Thus, here we posit that the connection between neuropsychiatric disorders and dysregulated DG neurogenesis is beyond correlation or epiphenomenon, and that the regulation of adult generated DG neurogenesis merits continued and focused attention in the ongoing effort to develop novel treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Simple Summary: Rescue shelters, although set-up with good intentions, may lead to poor welfare of the animals that they house, especially when the shelter organisation is under-resourced. This study therefore investigated the behavioural effects of cheap and locally accessible objects added to the cages of rescued Pit Bull Terrier type dogs in the Philippines to determine whether it is possible for shelter organisations with limited funds and staffing to improve the welfare of their dogs with minimal additional pressure on their time and financial budgets. The addition of enrichment (coconuts; cardboard bed; or cardboard partition) to the dogs' kennels positively affected their behavior but no one treatment was better at achieving this result. The results therefore suggest that it is possible for under-resourced rescue shelters to use cheap, locally available objects to improve the welfare of dogs in their care.
   Abstract:Although social enrichment can be considered beneficial in helping dogs cope with the kennel environment, when taking individual needs into account, it places a large demand on the carers and may not be appropriate in under-resourced kennels. Some kennels are also designed in such a way that there is too much social interaction, in that individuals cannot choose to distance themselves from conspecifics. This study therefore aimed to assess the effects of easily accessible enrichment on the behaviour of kennelled Pit Bull Terrier type dogs rescued from a dog-fighting ring in the Philippines. Thirty-six dogs were allocated to one of three treatment groups following a matched-subject design: (i) cardboard bed provision; (ii) coconut provision; and (iii) visual contact with dogs housed in adjacent cages obstructed with cardboard partitions. Behavioural diversity and the duration and frequency of individual behaviours were analysed using linear mixed-effect models. Yawning frequencies and time spent lying down and sitting decreased during treatment. No particular treatment was more influential in these behavioural changes. In conclusion, enrichment, regardless of type, affected the dogs' behaviour, with some effects depending on the sex of the dogs. Therefore, it is possible to cheaply and sustainably enrich the lives of dogs living in highly constrained environments, however, further research is required to refine the methods used.

AB  - The relationship between psycho-emotional disorders and cognitive impairments caused by early social isolation is not clear. In the present study, emotional-motivational state, habituation, and spatial memory were studied in male Wistar rats kept under social isolation for three months immediately after weaning from their mothers. After two months of social isolation we have revealed an increase in aggression in the social interaction test and anxiety in the Elevated Plus Maze, pre-pulse inhibition deficit and an increase in the amplitude of the modulated acoustic startle response in the test for sensorimotor reactivity as well as an impairment of short-term habituation by the dynamics of the acoustic startle. After three months of social isolation, aggressiveness in rats remained elevated, while an increase in anxiety was not detected. An increase in motor activity and an impairment of short-term habituation by the dynamics of locomotion in the "open field" test were found. After two and three months of social isolation, we did not reveal signs of depression in rats in the forced swimming test. After three months of isolation, the rats did not show the impairment of long-term spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze. However, we noted the peculiarities of acquisition of spatial learning to search the platform location in these animals, probably, due to the nature of their emotional response in an unfamiliar stressful situation. On the day of testing, in the absence of a platform, socially isolated rats tended to increase the number of visits, and the distance traveled in the zone adjacent to the platform during training days.

AB  - The present experiment was designed to investigate the effect of housing conditions on task performance and corticosterone response. Two groups of male F344BNF1 rats were housed on a ventilated rack with ad libitum access to water and a restricted feeding regime. Group 1 was housed in solid-bottom caging with corn cob bedding, whereas group 2 was housed in wire-bottom caging. After learning an operant task, each rat was exposed to acute restraint followed 48 h later by exposure to continuous light. Corticosterone concentrations were determined before and after exposure to each intervention. Contrary to assumptions, housing did not affect task performance. Baseline corticosterone concentrations were similar for the 2 experimental groups, but corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher for the wire-bottom group than the solid-bottom group immediately after the restraint and remained elevated 2 d later. Corticosterone levels decreased in both groups after exposure to continuous light. Overall, the data indicate that subtle but significant differences occur in responses of rats housed on wire-bottom versus solid-bottom caging when the animals are exposed to acute restraint.

AB  - BackgroundAllopregnanolone (3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone) is an inhibitory neurosteroid synthesized from progesterone via 5 alpha-reductase activity in the brain and has anxiolytic, antidepressant, sedative, anticonvulsant, and analgesic activity. Altered levels of allopregnanolone cause anxiety, depression, premenstrual syndrome, and psychiatric disorders. Although allopregnanolone exerts most of its actions by modulating GABA(A) receptor, NMDA receptor, BDNF expression, and PXR activity, a recent study showed its effects are blocked by mifepristone on lordosis behavior which indicates the involvement of progestin or glucocorticoid receptors in the effects of allopregnanolone since mifepristone blocks both these receptors. However, whether these receptors are involved in acute anxiolytic or antidepressant-like effects is unknown.
   MethodsAdult male Wistar rats were used to study whether the prior administration of mifepristone would alter the effects of allopregnanolone in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST) was evaluated.
   Results10 mg/Kg dose of allopregnanolone increased percent open arm entries in the EPM, whereas 3 mg/Kg dose of allopregnanolone decreased percent immobility in the FST. Mifepristone administration resulted in a U-shaped response in the FST (with 1 mg/Kg, s.c., decreasing the immobility time) without significantly impacting the behavior in the EPM. In combination studies, mifepristone blocked the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of allopregnanolone.
   ConclusionThe current study provides evidence for the first time that progestin or glucocorticoid receptors are involved in the acute anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of allopregnanolone. Understanding the mechanism of action of allopregnanolone will help us design better therapeutic strategies to treat neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression and anxiety.

AB  - We have recently found that isolation-reared mice show hyperactivity during an encounter with an intruder. However, it is not known whether encounter-induced hyperactivity may model some aspects of psychiatric disorders. The present study examined the pharmacological profile of encounter-induced hyperactivity in isolation-reared mice. Encounter-induced hyperactivity was reduced by acute administration of various antidepressants including the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (10mg/kg), the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine (10mg/kg) and paroxetine (10mg/kg), the 5-HT/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors venlafaxine (10mg/kg) and duloxetine (10mg/kg), the antipsychotic drug risperidone (0.01mg/kg), the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin (1mg/kg), and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-43044 (30mg/kg). The (2) adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.03mg/kg) and the 5-HT4 receptor agonist BIMU8 (30mg/kg) also reduced encounter-induced hyperactivity. The effect of desipramine was blocked by the (2) adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.3mg/kg). The effect of fluvoxamine was blocked by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist GR125487 (3mg/kg), but not the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (1mg/kg), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist azasetron (3mg/kg), or the 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB399885 (3mg/kg). The effect of venlafaxine was blocked by the simultaneous administration of idazoxan (0.3mg/kg) and GR125487 (3mg/kg), but not by either compound alone. These findings suggest that encounter-induced hyperactivity in isolation-reared mice is a robust model for testing the pharmacological profile of antidepressants, although the range of antidepressants tested is limited and some nonantidepressants are also effective. The present study also shows a key role of (2) and 5-HT4 receptors in the antidepressant effect in this model.

AB  - Grey matter loss occurs in different components of the prefrontal-limbic network (PLN) implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). This must be accounted for by specific pathologies of cells and their processes that comprise the grey matter. In order to identify these a quantitative evaluation of the contributions of neurons, glial cells, blood vessels and extracellular space to the grey matter volume is determined. This forms the basis of evaluating the various claims that the core pathology of certain cell types and/or their processes are responsible for the grey matter loss. It is concluded that it is the loss of synapses and concomitantly that of the dendrites on which they normally impinge that accounts quantitatively for the major loss of grey matter in different components of the PLN in depression.

AB  - In laboratory rats, naturally-occurring variations in maternal care have been used to study the neurobehavioral consequences of maternal nursing and to model the early-life adversity associated with many psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to determine the role of maternal care on behavior and monoamine concentrations at the prepubertal and young adulthood ages. We observed the licking/grooming (LG) behavior of Sprague-Dawley (SD) dams and assigned the litter to either low (LLG) or high (HLG) LG groups. Behavioral testing in the male offspring consisted of the open-field test, the elevated plus-maze, and the forced swimming test. Afterward, neurotransmitters contents were measured in the prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the hippocampus. We found that at the prepubertal stage, the effects of maternal care were only noticeable in the elevated plus-maze and the serotonin concentration in the nucleus accumbens. At adulthood, body weight and monoamines contents increased substantially in LLG rats. Specifically, they showed higher serotonin contents with a reduced turnover in almost all brain regions, followed by higher contents of norepinephrine and dopamine, especially in the nucleus accumbens. Changes in monoamines concentrations seem to be independent of the behavioral phenotype shaped by variations in maternal care, as behavioral effects were somewhat weak in both experiments. If higher monoamines contents in LLG rats represent an adaptive mechanism to deal with further adverse events, the behavioral paradigms used here were insufficiently challenging to bring out noticeable differences, at least in SD rats.

AB  - Environmental enrichment both improves the welfare of captive animals and increases the validity of research using these animals. Enrichment programs have been shown to prevent or reduce the development of behavioral vices, stereotypy, and fearfulness. However, the protocols used in enrichment studies can be inconsistent: under some protocols, enrichments are provided but not changed, while under others, enrichments are rotated frequently. Enrichment experiments to date have also largely ignored the influence of individual differences on fearfulness. The aim of this study was to determine whether frequent rotation of enrichment objects ("high novelty") was more effective than simply providing enrichment objects ("low novelty") in reducing neophobia in juvenile orange-winged Amazon parrots and to determine whether individual differences significantly affected neophobia. Thirty-four juvenile orange-winged Amazon parrots received both an 11-week high-novelty (HN) treatment and an 11-week low-novelty (LN) treatment, which were given in random order. Neophobia was assessed by measuring birds' latency to feed from a dish of highly favored food in the presence of various novel objects at approximately 10-day intervals. Our results indicate that the HN treatment significantly reduced neophobia in juvenile orange-winged Amazons. We also found that both individual variation in fearfulness and the novel object used for testing significantly affected birds' latency to feed in the presence of novel objects. Our results indicate that rotation of enrichment objects is more effective than simply providing enrichments in reducing fearful behavior in parrots. The effect of rotating enrichments was strong enough to overcome approximately four-fold differences in birds' latency to feed in the presence of different novel objects and even greater individual differences in neophobia. However, we also found that in highly fearful individuals, HN actually increased birds' latency to feed in the presence of novel objects. Our results indicate that rotation of enrichment objects is more effective than simply providing enrichments in reducing fearful behavior in parrots, but that both enrichment object properties and individual differences should be carefully considered in the design of future enrichment studies and protocols.

AB  - Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is clinically used for severe depression and drug-resistant Parkinson's disease, its exact biological background and mechanism have not yet been fully elucidated. Two potential explanations have been presented so far to explain the increased neuroplastic and resilient profiles of multiple ECT administrations. One is the alteration of central neurotransmitter receptor densities and the other is the expressional upregulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor in various brain regions with enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and mossy fiber sprouting. In the present report, western blot analyses revealed significantly upregulated expression of various endocytosis-related proteins following 10-day electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) treatment in rat hippocampal homogenates and hippocampal lipid raft fractions extracted using an ultracentrifugation procedure. Upregulated proteins included endocytosis-related scaffolding proteins (caveolin-1, flotillin-1, and heavy and light chains of clathrin) and small GTPases (Rab5, Rab7, Rab11, and Rab4) specifically expressed on various types of endosomes. Two scaffolding proteins, caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, were also increased in the lipid raft fraction. Together with our previous finding of increased autophagy-related proteins in the hippocampal region, the present results suggest membrane trafficking machinery is enhanced following 10-day ECS treatment. We consider that the membrane trafficking machinery that transports functional proteins in the neuronal cells and from or into the synaptic membranes is one of the new candidates supporting the cellular and behavioral neuroplastic profiles of ECS treatments in animal experiments and ECT administrations in clinical settings.

AB  - The metabolism cage is a barren, non-enriched, environment, combining a number of recognized environmental stressors. We investigated the ability of male BALB/c mice to acclimatize to this form of housing. For three weeks markers of acute and oxidative stress, as well as clinical signs of abnormality were monitored. Forced swim tests were conducted to determine whether the animals experienced behavioral despair and the serotonergic integrity was tested using an 8-OH-DPAT challenge. The metabolism cage housed mice excreted approximately tenfold higher amounts of corticosterone metabolites in feces throughout the study when compared to controls. Urinary biomarkers confirmed that these mice suffered from elevated levels of oxidative stress, and increased creatinine excretions indicated increased muscle catabolism. Changes in the core body temperature (stress-induced hyperthermia) and the fur state of the mice also indicated impaired well-being in the metabolism cage housed mice. However, monitoring body weight and feed intake was found misleading in assessing the wellbeing of mice over a longer time course, and the forced swim test was found poorly suited for studying chronic stress in mice in the present setup. In conclusion, the mice were found not to acclimatize to the metabolism cages whereby concern for animal welfare would dictate that mice should be housed in this way for as short periods as possible. The elevated degree of HPA axis activity, oxidative stress, and increased overall metabolism warrant caution when interpreting data obtained from metabolism cage housed mice, as their condition cannot be considered representative of a normal physiology.

AB  - "General cognitive ability" describes a trait that transcends specific learning domains and impacts a wide range of cognitive skills. Individual animals (including humans) exhibit wide variations in their expression of this trait. We have previously determined that the propensity for exploration is highly correlated with the general cognitive abilities of individual outbred mice. Here, we asked if inducing an increase in exploratory behaviors would causally promote an increase in animals' general learning abilities. In three experiments, juvenile and young-adult male CD-1 outbred mice were exposed to 12 novel environments starting at post-natal days 39 (juvenile) and 61 (Young adult), after which they underwent a series of cognitive and exploratory tests as adults (beginning at post-natal day 79). Exposure to novel environments promoted increases in exploration (across multiple measures) on two different tasks, including an elevated plus maze. However, a subsequent test of general learning abilities (aggregate performance across five distinct learning tasks) determined that exposure to novel environments as juveniles or young-adults had no effect on general learning abilities in adulthood. Therefore, while exposure to novel environments promotes long-lasting increases in mice's exploratory tendencies, these increases in exploration do not appear to causally impact general learning abilities.

AB  - Chronic stress in farm animals can induce detrimental effects in emotional sensitivity and cognitive function, for example, by altering fearfulness and eliciting pessimistic-like judgment. Based on a few experiments carried out on laboratory animals, we suggest that exposing chronically stressed sheep to an enriched environment could alleviate the detrimental stress-induced effects on fearfulness and judgment. Fifteen lambs (Chronically Stressed lambs, CS) were submitted for 7 weeks to a treatment known to induce chronic stress (i.e. repeated and unpredictable exposures to various uncontrollable and aversive events every day and/or night). Fifteen other lambs (lambs exposed to Negative and Positive events, NP) were also submitted to the same stressful treatment and, for the last 4 weeks of the stressful treatment, exposed daily to various positive events, i.e. wool brush, positive contact with humans and anticipation of food by a light announcing daily food distribution. Before the treatment, all lambs were individually trained to spatially differentiate between positive and negative reinforced bucket locations with a go/no-go approach response. At the end of the treatment, each lamb was exposed to a judgment test using the same go/no-go design by offering it three ambiguous and unreinforced bucket locations in addition to the two learnt locations. In addition, lambs were exposed to two standard tests of fearfulness (exposure to novelty and suddenness) and human approach test. NP lambs displayed a positive judgement bias: they approached the bucket placed at the ambiguous location that was closest to the positive one faster than CS lambs (3.0s +/- 0.3 vs. 5.9s +/- 1.6; P=0.006). NP lambs approached the human more than their counterparts (15.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.5 times in human zone during 10 min; P=0.003) and were also more reactive to novelty and suddenness. Thus, repeated exposure lambs to positive events during a stressful period induces an optimistic-like judgment but also increases emotional reactivity. Further studies are thus necessary before promoting such a positive treatment as a method to alleviate negative effects of chronic stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mice are the most widely used model species for drug discovery and scientific research. Consequently, it is important to refine laboratory procedures and practices to ensure high standards of welfare and scientific data quality. Recent studies have identified that the standard practice of handling laboratory mice by their tails increases behaviours indicative of anxiety, which can be overcome by handling mice using a tunnel. However, despite clear negative effects on mice's behaviour, tunnel handling has yet to be widely implemented. In this study, we provide the first evidence that tail handling also reduces mice's responses to reward. Anhedonia is a core symptom of clinical depression, and is measured in rodents by assessing how they consume a sucrose solution: depressed mice consume less sucrose and the size of their licking bouts when drinking (their 'lick cluster sizes') also tend to be smaller. We found that tail handled mice showed more anhedonic responses in both measures compared to tunnel handled mice, indicative of a decreased responsiveness to reward and potentially a more depressive-like state. Our findings have significant implications for the welfare of laboratory mice as well as the design and interpretation of scientific studies, particularly those investigating or involving reward.

AB  - Mouse strain differences in immobility and in sensitivity to antidepressants have been observed in the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). However, the neurotransmitter systems and neural substrates that contribute to these differences remain unknown. To investigate the role of the hippocampal serotonin transporter (5-HTT), we measured baseline immobility and the immobility responses to fluoxetine (FLX) in the FST and the TST in male CD-1, C57BL/6, DBA and BALB/c mice. We observed strain differences in baseline immobility time, with CD-1 mice showing the longest and DBA mice showing the shortest. In contrast, DBA and BALB/c mice showed the highest sensitivity to FLX, whereas CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice showed the lowest sensitivity. Also we found strain differences in both the total 5-HTT protein level and the membrane-bound 5-HTT level (estimated by V-max) as follows: DBA>BALB/c>CD-1=C57BL/6. The uptake efficiency of the membrane-bound 5-HTT (estimated by 1/K-m) was highest in DBA and BALB/c mice and lowest in CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice. A correlation analysis of subregions within the hippocampus revealed that immobility time was negatively correlated with V-max and positively correlated with K-m in the hippocampus. Therefore a higher uptake capacity of the membrane-bound 5-HTT in the hippocampus was associated with lower baseline immobility and greater sensitivity to FLX. These results suggest that alterations in hippocampal 5-HTT activity may contribute to mouse strain differences in the FST and the TST.

AB  - The study presents a newly constructed modification of a random positioning machine (RPM) used in 3D-clinostat and in random mode. The main purpose is to provide an RPM animal model that uses up to four experimental animals simultaneously. In order to validate our RPM, the gravity dispersion and its magnitude are compared with the ones of a traditional machine. The results showed no crucial deviations in gravity dispersion and its time-averaged value in all sets of parameters. Furthermore, a posteriori stress tests are conducted on three Wistar male rats groups in order to estimate the level of stress from the setup. The social trait results suggest that the group exposed to our device has no increase in anxiety.

AB  - We reared ICR mice during a growth period (3 to 10 weeks of age) and examined the effect of exercise induction, by enriching the rearing environment with obstacles such as ladders, compared to the standard environment. Environmental enrichment significantly increased the amount of exercise in both sexes (P<0.01). Enriched exercise mice had higher body weight than control mice at 6 to 9 weeks of age in males and 8 weeks of age in females (P<0.05). The sexual maturation of female enriched exercise mice was significantly advanced compared to the control (P<0.001). Enriched exercise mice showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in the open field test and lower plasma corticosterone levels in both sexes compared to the control, and differences were statistically significant in males (P<0.05). In both sexes, enriched exercise appeared to increase natural killer cells in blood compared to the control, but no statistical differences was detected. In conclusion, we confirmed that daily low-stress exercise could be induced using a three-dimensional rearing environment in growing mice. In addition, we suggest that exercise has beneficial effects on physical growth, sexual maturation and anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, environmental enrichment might be more effective in male than female in group-housed mice.

AB  - In normal rats exploring a novel, complex environment, in comparison to control non-exploring rats, there is induction of the FOS protein, a marker of neuronal activity, in all layers of the striate visual cortex (particularly in the granular and supragranular layers), in the stratum griseum superficiale of the superior colliculus, and in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as in all layers of the whiskers barrel held in the somatosensory cortex. A surprising finding was a selective activation of the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus, in dorsocaudal parts of the nucleus. To the contrary, in Visually deprived rats exploring a never environment which would depend critically on whiskers tactile clues for exploration there was instead a selective activation of the somatic sector in central parts of the thalamic reticular nucleus, in conjunction with activation of cortical whiskers barrel field.
   From these results it is concluded: (1) Different sensory sectors of the rat thalamic reticular nucleus are activated depending on prevalent sensory channels used in recognition of the environment, suggesting a role of thalamic reticular nucleus in optimizing thalamocortical transmission of essential external cues to guide adequate behaviour. (2) In the awake state, the granular and supragranular layers of the visual and somatosensory cortices are more active when attention is paid to sensory stimuli that are essential for recognition of the environment. (3) The selective induction of c-fos in the Visual and somatosensory cortices, and in the stratum griseum superficiale of superior colliculus of rats exploring a novel, complex environment might be related to plastic changes that have been demonstrated in these centres in rats raised in complex environments. These plastic changes are likely to be the result of target late-response genes activated by c-fos. Copyright (C) 1996 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Attention to key features of contexts and things is a necessary tool for all organisms. Detecting these salient features of cues, or simply, salience, can also be affected by exposure to traumatic stress, as has been widely reported in individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Interestingly, similar observations have been robustly replicated across many animal models of stress as well. By using evidence from such rodent stress paradigms, in the present review, we explore PTSD through the lens of salience processing. In this context, we propose that interaction between the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoids determines the long lasting cellular and behavioural consequences of stress salience. We also describe the dual effect of glucocorticoid therapy in the amelioration of PTSD symptoms. Finally, by integrating in vivo observations at multiple scales of plasticity, we propose a unifying hypothesis that pivots on a crucial role of glucocorticoid signalling in dynamically orchestrating stress salience.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is a legal requirement for European pig farms. The suitability of enrichment materials for neonatal pigs is understudied and has not been tested in commercial settings. This study investigates the effect of hanging objects and substrate as two enrichment strategies pre-weaning, and compares the effect of these enrichment objects on play behaviour, aggression, growth and stress coping ability during lactation until 10 days after weaning. Farrowing crates were equipped with either six hanging objects (OB), a substrate box with wood bark (SUB), or nothing (control; CON). The behaviour of over 600 piglets (similar to 210 piglets/treatment) was recorded weekly by instantaneous scan sampling (10 s/piglet, repeated 6 times per day for 6 days). Aggression was monitored through skin lesions on focal piglets on 1 day before weaning and 1 and 2 days after weaning. Piglets were weighed individually every week. Stress coping ability was assessed through salivary cortisol from a sample of six piglets per litter on 1 day before (baseline), and on days 1 and 2 after weaning. Both enrichment groups showed more object play during lactation as compared to the control group (P < 0.001). The amount of object play increased linearly with age (P < 0.001). Enrichment did not affect social play or locomotor play during lactation. Enrichment did not influence the amount of skin lesions before weaning, but heavier piglets had more skin lesions (P < 0.01). The enrichment strategies had no influence on weight gain at any stage. The baseline of the salivary cortisol concentration was similar amongst the treatment groups; however, the cortisol concentration of the object group and control group was significantly higher at one day after weaning than at baseline (P < 0.001) whereas the substrate group showed no significant increase. In conclusion, providing either hanging objects or substrate alone could encourage neonatal piglets to express more object play behaviour. Compared to the hanging objects, providing substrate in the commercial neonatal environment demonstrated to decrease piglets' stress at weaning, and therefore increase animal welfare.

AB  - Adult mammalian brains continuously generate new neurons, a phenomenon called adult neurogenesis. Both environmental stimuli and endogenous factors are important regulators of adult neurogenesis. Sleep has an important role in normal brain physiology and its disturbance causes very stressful conditions, which disrupt normal brain physiology. Recently, an influence of sleep in adult neurogenesis has been established, mainly based on sleep deprivation studies. This review provides an overview on how rhythms and sleep cycles regulate hippocampal and subventricular zone neurogenesis, discussing some potential underlying mechanisms. In addition, our review highlights some interacting points between sleep and adult neurogenesis in brain function, such as learning, memory, and mood states, and provides some insights on the effects of antidepressants and hypnotic drugs on adult neurogenesis.

AB  - There are biological and environmental factors which lead to stereotypic behaviour in humans and animals. Abnormal, functionless repetitive behaviour may have a genetic or epigenetic background; however, in the case of farm animals it is often linked with maintenance in a barren environment. Stereotypies have been considered as an indicator of poor welfare. They may occur in chronic stress situations as an animal's way of coping. Stereotypies are often noticed in cattle, pigs and horses kept individually. This form of behaviour is generally associated with the situation when an animal cannot satisfy its natural needs. Taking into consideration the currently increasing concern about maintaining proper husbandry conditions, especially in intensive breeding systems, the environmental improvement has become an important issue. The objective of this review is to present a characteristic of stereotypies in cattle, pigs and horses and to show various methods of reducing the frequency of this behaviour.

AB  - Pigeons prefer a low-probability, high-payoff but suboptimal alternative over a reliable low-payoff optimal alternative (i.e., one that results in more food). This finding is analogous to suboptimal human monetary gambling because in both cases there appears to be an overemphasis of the occurrence of the winning event (a jackpot) and an underemphasis of losing events. In the present research we found that pigeons chose suboptimally to the degree that they were impulsive as indexed by the steeper slope of the hyperbolic delay-discounting function (i.e., the shorter the delay they would accept in a smaller-sooner/larger-later procedure). These correlational findings have implications for the mechanisms underlying suboptimal choice by humans (e.g., problem gamblers) and they suggest that high baseline levels of impulsivity can enhance acquisition of a gambling habit.

AB  - Purpose of Review Studies of the neurobiology and treatment of PTSD have highlighted many aspects of the pathophysiology of this disorder that might be relevant to treatment. The purpose of this review is to highlight the potential clinical importance of an often-neglected consequence of stress models in animals that may be relevant to PTSD: the stress-related loss of synaptic connectivity.
   Recent Findings Here, we will briefly review evidence that PTSD might be a "synaptic disconnection syndrome" and highlight the importance of this perspective for the emerging therapeutic application of ketamine as a potential rapid-acting treatment for this disorder that may work, in part, by restoring synaptic connectivity.
   Summary Synaptic disconnection may contribute to the profile of PTSD symptoms that may be targeted by novel pharmacotherapeutics.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to observe the depression-like behavior induced by social isolation; detect the antidepressant effect of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing NAP on social isolation mice by intranasal delivery. After construction of NT4-NAP/AAV, expression of NAP was confirmed in vitro. 3-week-old C57/BL mice were bred individually in cages as social isolation-rearing. Six weeks later, the first subset of mice underwent behavioral tests and western blot; the second was for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NT4-NAP/AAV was delivered quaque die by nasal administration for consecutive 10 days before behavioral test. Several depression-like behaviors were observed in social isolation mice, including decreased relative sucrose preference, longer immobility time in forced swimming test, lower plasma corticosterone and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampus. Thus, social isolation procedure appears to be an animal model of depression with good face and construct validity. What's more, the antidepressant effect in social isolation-rearing mice was observed after intranasal administration of NT4-NAP/AAV, suggesting that this might be a promising therapeutic strategy for depressive disorder.

AB  - An extensive body of evidence supports the notion that exposure to an enriched/impoverished environment alters brain functions via epigenetic changes. However, how specific modifications of social environment modulate brain functions remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigate the molecular and behavioral consequences of briefly manipulating social settings in young andmiddle-aged wild-type mice. We observe that, modifications of the social context, only affect the performance in socially related tasks. Social enrichment increases sociability whereas isolation leads to the opposite effect. Our work also pointed out specific miRNA signatures associated to each social environment. These miRNA alterations are reversible and found selectively in the medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, we show that miRNA modifications linked to social enrichment or isolation might target rather different intracellular pathways. Together, these observations suggest that the prefrontal cortex may be a key brain area integrating social information via the modification of precise miRNA networks.

AB  - (1) Background: Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone that has antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in preclinical studies. Here, we investigated the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of sub-chronic treatment with AdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor agonist, and its potential linkage to changes in hippocampal adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. (2) Methods: Different cohorts of wild-type C57BL/6J and CamKII alpha-Cre male mice were treated with sub-chronic (7 days) AdipoRon, followed by behavioral, molecular, and electrophysiological experiments. (3) Results: 7-day AdipoRon treatment elicited antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects but did not affect hippocampal neurogenesis. AdipoRon treatment reduced hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, neuronal activation in the ventral dentate gyrus, and long-term potentiation of the perforant path. The knockdown of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits GluN2A and GluN2B in the ventral hippocampus did not affect the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of AdipoRon. (4) Conclusions: Increasing adiponectin signaling through sub-chronic AdipoRon treatment results in antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects independent of changes in hippocampal structural and synaptic function.

AB  - Ancestral stress can program stress sensitivity and health trajectories across multiple generations. While ancestral stress is uncontrollable to the filial generations, it is critical to identify therapies that overcome transgenerational programming. Here we report that prenatal stress in rats generates a transgenerationally heritable endocrine and epigenetic footprint and elevated stress sensitivity which can be alleviated by beneficial experiences in later life. Ancestral stress led to downregulated glucocorticoid receptor and prefrontal cortex neuronal densities along with precocious development of anxiety-like behaviours. Environmental enrichment (EE) during adolescence mitigated endocrine and neuronal markers of stress and improved miR-182 expression linked to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) regulation in stressed lineages. Thus, EE may serve as a powerful intervention for adverse transgenerational programming through microRNA-mediated regulation of BDNF and NT-3 pathways. The identification of microRNAs that mediate the actions of EE highlights new therapeutic strategies for mental health conditions and psychiatric disease.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been successfully implemented in human rehabilitation settings. However, the mechanisms underlying its success are not understood. Incorporating components of EE protocols into our animal models allows for the exploration of these mechanisms and their role in mitigation. Using a mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA), the present study explored disruptions in social behavior and associated hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis functioning, and whether a supportive environment could prevent these effects. We show that prenatal immune activation of toll-like receptor 3, by the viral mimetic polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), led to disrupted maternal care in that dams built poorer quality nests, an effect corrected by EE housing. Standard housed male and female MIA mice engaged in higher rates of repetitive rearing and had lower levels of social interaction, alongside sex-specific expression of several ventral hippocampal neural stress markers. Moreover, MIA males had delayed recovery of plasma corticosterone in response to a novel social encounter. Enrichment housing, likely mediated by improved maternal care, protected against these MIA-induced effects. We also evaluated c-Fos immunoreactivity associated with the novel social experience and found MIA to decrease neural activation in the dentate gyrus. Activation in the hypothalamus was blunted in EE housed animals, suggesting that the putative circuits modulating social behaviors may be different between standard and complex housing environments. These data demonstrate that augmentation of the environment supports parental care and offspring safety/security, which can offset effects of early health adversity by buffering HPA axis dysregulation. Our findings provide further evidence for the viability of EE interventions in maternal and pediatric settings.

AB  - Unpredictable aversive experiences, or stressors, lead to changes in depression- and anxiety-related behavior and to changes in hippocampal structure including decreases in adult neurogenesis, granule cell and pyramidal cell dendritic morphology, and volume. Here we review the relationship between these behavioral and structural changes and discuss the possibility that these changes may be largely adaptive. Specifically, we suggest that new neurons in the dentate gyrus enhance behavioral adaptability to changes in the environment, biasing behavior in novel situations based on previous experience with stress. Conversely, atrophy-like changes in the hippocampus and decreased adult neurogenesis following chronic stress may serve to limit stress responses and stabilize behavior during chronic stress.

AB  - Boredom is likely to have adaptive value in motivating exploration and learning, and many animals may possess the basic neurological mechanisms to support it. Chronic inescapable boredom can be extremely aversive, and understimulation can harm neural, cognitive and behavioural flexibility. Wild and domesticated animals are at particular risk in captivity, which is often spatially and temporally monotonous. Yet biological research into boredom has barely begun, despite having important implications for animal welfare, the evolution of motivation and cognition, and for human dysfunction at individual and societal levels. Here I aim to facilitate hypotheses about how monotony affects behaviour and physiology, so that boredom can be objectively studied by ethologists and other scientists. I cover valence (pleasantness) and arousal (wakefulness) qualities of boredom, because both can be measured, and I suggest boredom includes suboptimal arousal and aversion to monotony. Because the suboptimal arousal during boredom is aversive, individuals will resist low arousal. Thus, behavioural indicators of boredom will, seemingly paradoxically, include signs of increasing drowsiness, alongside bouts of restlessness, avoidance and sensation-seeking behaviour. Valence and arousal are not, however, sufficient to fully describe boredom. For example, human boredom is further characterized by a perception that time 'drags', and this effect of monotony on time perception can too be behaviourally assayed in animals. Sleep disruption and some abnormal behaviour may also be caused by boredom. Ethological research into this emotional phenomenon will deepen understanding of its causes, development, function and evolution, and will enable evidence-based interventions to mitigate human and animal boredom.

AB  - Effects of rearing conditions on the development of social relationships were investigated in female pigs. For that purpose, one group of piglets was reared in a poor environment (i.e., a commercially used indoor 4.2-m(2) standard farrowing crate) and the other in an enriched environment (i.e., 0.5-ha outdoor pasture with half-open far-rowing crates). After weaning, all piglets were housed in pairs under standard conditions. Dominant and subordinate individuals were distinguished within pairs and social relationships between members of a pair were studied in adulthood. The results show that pails reared in a poor environment behave more aggressively. The subordinates of these pairs also develop symptoms indicative of chronic social stress exposure: i.e., they show a delayed onset of puberty, a smaller daily weight gain, and elevated basal cortisol levels that are also higher 5 h after an acute restraint stressor (tethering stress). No such deviations were found in subordinates reared in an enriched environment. It is concluded that rearing piglets in a poor environment may facilitate the development of social stress in adult (subordinate) pigs. Two underlying mechanisms may be proposed: a) deteriorated social skills lead to increased social stress, or b) a failure to cope with stressors in general, and the stress of being subordinate in particular, occurs in animals reared under poor conditions.

AB  - Chronic stress models, established in adult Sprague-Dawley rats through a 14-day subcutaneous injection of 40 mg/kg corticosterone, once per day, were given a daily oral feeding of 50 mg/kg baicalin. The study was an attempt to observe the effect of baicalin on neurogenesis in chronically stressed rats. Results showed that subcutaneous injection of corticosterone significantly decreased the total number of doublecortin-positive neurons in the hippocampus. The reduced cell number caused by corticosterone was mainly due to the decrease of class II doublecortin-positive neurons, but the class I doublecortin-positive neurons were unaffected. Baicalin treatment increased the number of both class I and class II doublecortin-positive neurons. In addition, doublecortin-positive neurons showed less complexity in dendritic morphology after corticosterone injection, and this change was totally reversed by baicalin treatment. These findings suggest that baicalin exhibits a beneficial effect on adult neurogenesis.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a tandem repeat mutation encoding an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein, which leads to cognitive, psychiatric and motor dysfunction. Exposure to environmental enrichment (EE), which enhances levels of cognitive stimulation and physical activity, has therapeutic effects on cognitive, affective and motor function of transgenic HD mice. The present study investigated gene expression changes and behavioral pharmacology in male and female R6/1 transgenic HD mice at an early time-point in HD progression associated with onset of cognitive and affective abnormalities, following EE and exercise (wheel running) interventions. We have demonstrated changes in expression levels of the serotonin (5-HT) receptor Htr1a, Htr1b, Htr2a and Htr2c genes (encoding the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, respectively) in HD brains at 8 weeks of age, using quantitative real-time PCR. In contrast, expression of the serotonin transporter (SerT, also known as 5-HTT or Slc6a4) was not altered in these brains. Furthermore, we identified region-specific, sex-specific and environmentally regulated (comparing EE, exercise and standard housing conditions) impacts on gene expression of particular 5-HT receptors, as well as SerT. For example, SerT gene expression was upregulated by exercise (wheel running from 6 to 8 weeks of age) in the hippocampus. Interestingly, when EE was introduced from 6 to 8 weeks of age, Htr2a gene expression was upregulated in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus of male mice. EE also rescued the functional activity of 5-HT2 receptors as observed in the head-twitch test, reflecting sexually dimorphic effects of environmental stimulation. These findings demonstrate that disruption of the serotonergic system occurs early in HD pathogenesis and, together with previous findings, show that the timing and duration of environmental interventions are critical in terms of their ability to modify gene expression. This study is the first to show that EE is able to selectively enhance both gene expression of a neurotransmitter receptor and the functional consequences on behavioral pharmacology, and links this molecular modulation to the therapeutic effects of environmental stimulation in this neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Scientists are often reluctant to attribute emotions to nonhuman animals that are similar to human emotions. When the author published her early studies, reviewers prohibited the word fear. Fearful behavior had to be described as agitated. The core emotional systems described by Panksepp may provide a useful framework for people who work hands-on with animals. The core systems are fear, rage, panic (separation distress), seek, lust, nurture, and play. Some scientists who deny that animals have real emotions often fail to review important areas of the literature. The areas that are sometimes left out are the effects of psychiatric medications on animals and genetic influences on differences in animal behavior. In both people and animals, genetics has an influence on both fearfulness and novelty seeking. Visualizing the seven core emotional systems as separate volume controls on a music mixing board may help zoo professionals determine the motivation of both normal and abnormal behavior. It may also help them to design more effective environmental enrichments.

AB  - Behavioral experience (BE) can critically influence later behavior and brain function, but the central nervous system (CNS) consequences of most developmental neurotoxicants are examined in the absence of any such context. We previously demonstrated marked differences in neurotransmitter changes produced by developmental lead (Pb) exposure prenatal stress (PS) depending upon whether or not rats had been given BE (Cory-Slechta, D. A., Virgolini, M. B., Rossi-George, A., Weston, D., and Thiruchelvam, M. (2009). The current study examined the hypothesis that the nature of the BE itself would be a critical determinant of outcome in mice that had been continually exposed to 0 or 100 ppm Pb acetate in drinking water alone or in combination with prenatal restraint stress. Half of the offspring in each of the four resulting groups/gender were exposed to positively reinforced (food-rewarded Fixed Interval schedule-controlled behavior) or negatively reinforced (inescapable forced swim) BE. Brain monoamines and amino acids differed significantly in relation to BE, even in control animals, as did the trajectory of effects of Pb PS, particularly in frontal cortex, hippocampus (both genders), and midbrain (males). In males, Pb PS-related changes in neurotransmitters correlated with behavioral performance. These findings suggest that CNS consequences of developmental toxicants studied in the absence of a broader spectrum of BEs may not necessarily be predictive of human outcomes. Evaluating the role of specific BEs as a modulator of neurodevelopmental insults offers the opportunity to determine what specific BEs may ameliorate the associated impacts and can assist in establishing underlying neurobiological mechanisms.

AB  - Genetic factors and early life adversity both play a major role in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Previous studies have shown that postnatal maternal separation (MS) can produce lasting abnormalities in emotion-related behavior and neuroendocrine responses to stress in rodents. The present study sought to examine the effects of repeated MS in eight different inbred strains of mice (129S1/SvImJ, 129P3/J, A/J, BALB/cJ, BALB/cByJ C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ). Pups were separated from their dam and littermates for 180 min/day ('MS') or 15 min/day ('handling'), or left undisturbed ('facility-reared') from postnatal days P0-P13, and tested as adults for anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Results demonstrated no clear and consistent effects of MS or handling on behavioral phenotypes in any of the strains tested. In all strains, MS produced an increase in maternal care on reunion with pups, which may have modified MS effects. Data demonstrate that the MS procedure employed does not provide a robust model of early life stress effects on the anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in the mouse strains tested.

AB  - The integral membrane protein synaptophysin is one of the most abundant polypeptide components of synaptic vesicles. It is not essential for neurotransmission despite its abundance but is believed to modulate the efficiency of the synaptic vesicle cycle. Detailed behavioral analyses were therefore performed on synaptophysin knockout mice to test whether synaptophysin affects higher brain functions. We find that these animals are more exploratory than their wild type counterparts examining novel objects more closely and intensely in an enriched open field arena. We also detect impairments in learning and memory, most notably reduced object novelty recognition and reduced spatial learning. These deficits are unlikely caused by impaired vision, since all electroretinographic parameters measured were indistinguishable from those in wild type controls although an inverse optomotor reaction was observed. Taken together, our observations demonstrate functional consequences of synaptophysin depletion in a living organism. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In man, many different events implying childhood separation from caregivers/unstable parental environment are associated with heightened risk for panic disorder in adulthood. Twin data show that the occurrence of such events in childhood contributes to explaining the covariation between separation anxiety disorder, panic, and the related psychobiological trait of CO2 hypersensitivity. We hypothesized that early interference with infant-mother interaction could moderate the interspecific trait of response to CO2 through genetic control of sensitivity to the environment.
   Methodology: Having spent the first 24 hours after birth with their biological mother, outbred NMRI mice were cross-fostered to adoptive mothers for the following 4 post-natal days. They were successively compared to normally-reared individuals for: number of ultrasonic vocalizations during isolation, respiratory physiology responses to normal air (20%O-2), CO2-enriched air (6% CO2), hypoxic air (10%O-2), and avoidance of CO2-enriched environments.
   Results: Cross-fostered pups showed significantly more ultrasonic vocalizations, more pronounced hyperventilatory responses (larger tidal volume and minute volume increments) to CO2-enriched air and heightened aversion towards CO2-enriched environments, than normally-reared individuals. Enhanced tidal volume increment response to 6% CO2 was present at 16-20, and 75-90 postnatal days, implying the trait's stability. Quantitative genetic analyses of unrelated individuals, sibs and half-sibs, showed that the genetic variance for tidal volume increment during 6% CO2 breathing was significantly higher (Bartlett chi = 8.3, p = 0.004) among the cross-fostered than the normally-reared individuals, yielding heritability of 0.37 and 0.21 respectively. These results support a stress-diathesis model whereby the genetic influences underlying the response to 6% CO2 increase their contribution in the presence of an environmental adversity. Maternal grooming/licking behaviour, and corticosterone basal levels were similar among cross-fostered and normally-reared individuals.
   Conclusions: A mechanism of gene-by-environment interplay connects this form of early perturbation of infant-mother interaction, heightened CO2 sensitivity and anxiety. Some non-inferential physiological measurements can enhance animal models of human neurodevelopmental anxiety disorders.

AB  - We argue that animal temperament is an important concept for wildlife conservation science and review causes and consequences of evolutionary changes in temperament traits that may occur in captive-breeding programmes. An evolutionary perspective is valid because temperament traits are heritable, linked to fitness and potentially subject to intense selection in captivity. Natural, sexual and artificial selection can cause permanent shifts in temperament, reducing the diversity of temperament traits, diversity that may be critical to reintroduction success. Breeding programmes that ignore temperament risk leading the captive population towards domestication. Furthermore, shifts in temperament may involve alterations in linked morphological and physiological traits, and selection may even change functional relationships between traits. Captive-breeding programmes can reduce changes in temperaments by closely monitoring temperament traits, equalizing reproductive success between temperament morphs and using environmental enrichment to reduce captive stress. Under certain circumstances, knowledge about temperament may also provide a useful tool to optimize captive reproduction and to increase reintroduction success. Outside reintroduction programmes, temperament can mediate responses to human contact, hunting, exploitation, habitat fragmentation and disease transmission. Consideration of temperaments could strengthen both captive and wild conservation efforts.

AB  - The paper reviews current definitions and concepts of "welfare" in farm animal welfare related literature, with focus on fattening pig husbandry. The respective concepts of welfare are analysed, and the concepts of explanation are categorised: reductionally, based on the animals' adaptability, based on the animals' feelings, comprehensive. In literature, "welfare" is used non-Linifornily. Behind that, there are different concepts of welfare which reflect various attitudes towards animals. Furthermore, varying definitions also lead to differing traits and methods used to estimate welfare in farm animals. This, finally, ends in divergent interpretations of results of such studies even though they seem to pursue similar aims, namely to estimate or promote farm animal welfare. The present analysis shall contribute to the elucidation of backgrounds of interpretation of "welfare" in order to help outline practical oriented investigations dealing with welfare of farm animals, in a clear and well defined manner, in advance. It is emphasized that welfare is complex and any investigation of it, therefore, has to be carried out on a basis of manifold traits (indicators) and methods. Under the premiss of a clear concept and definition of welfare in which the limits are set clearly, too, estimation of welfare of pigs is possible using several indicators.

AB  - Stress is a leading risk factor for the onset and recurrence of major depression. Enhancing stress resilience may be a therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of depression in at-risk populations or its recurrence in depressed patients. Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu(2/3)) antagonists have been recognized for antidepressant-like actions in preclinical models, but have not been evaluated for prophylactic effects. We assessed the role of mGlu(2/3) in modulating stress resilience using subtype-specific knockout mice lacking mGlu(2) (Grm2(-/-)) or mGlu(3) (Grm3(-/-)), and pharmacological manipulations of mGlu(2/3) activity during or prior to the induction and reinstatement of stress-induced behavioral deficits. Grm2(-/-), but not Grm3(-/-), mice exhibited reduced forced-swimming test immobility time and were resilient to developing inescapable shock (IES)-induced escape deficits. Grm2(-/-) mice were also resilient to developing corticosterone (CORT)-induced escape deficits and chronic social defeat stress-induced anhedonia. Pharmacological blockade of mGlu(2/3) with the antagonist LY341495 during stress prevented the development of IES- and CORT-induced escape deficits, while activation with the agonist LY379268 increased susceptibility to escape deficits. Prophylactic treatment with the LY341495, both systemically and via microinjection into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), up to 7 days before IES, prevented both the induction of escape deficits and their reinstatement by brief re-exposure to IES up to 20 days after treatment. Overall, blockade of mGlu(2/3) enhanced stress resilience and deletion of mGlu(2), but not mGlu(3), conferred a stress-resilient phenotype, indicating that prophylactic treatments reducing mGlu(2) activity may protect against stress-induced changes underlying the development or recurrence of stress-induced disorders, including depression.

AB  - Social dysfunction is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI), contributing to reduced quality of life for survivors. Factors which influence the development or persistence of social deficits after injury remain poorly understood, particularly in the context of ongoing brain maturation during childhood and adolescence. Aberrant social interactions have recently been modeled in adult and juvenile rodents after experimental TBI, providing an opportunity to gain new insights into the underlying neurobiology of these behaviors. Here, we review our current understanding of social dysfunction in both humans and rodent models of TBI, with a focus on brain injuries acquired during early development. Modulators of social outcomes are discussed, including injury-related and environmental risk and resilience factors. Disruption of social brain network connectivity and aberrant neuroendocrine function are identified as potential mechanisms of social impairments after pediatric TBI. Throughout, we highlight the overlap and disparities between outcome measures and findings from clinical and experimental approaches, and explore the translational potential of future research to prevent or ameliorate social dysfunction after childhood TBI.

AB  - Gene-environment interactions are known to play a major role in the ethiopathology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study investigates whether environmental manipulations, that is, social isolation, may affect the genetic predisposition to develop AD-related traits in a triple transgenic mouse model (3 X Tg-AD), as suggested by our previous study employing physical exercise (Pietropaolo et al., 2008). Mutant and wild type mice of both sexes were housed singly or in groups from weaning, and evaluated behaviorally at 6 to 7 months of age. Independent of sex, the 3 X Tg-AD genotype was associated with enhanced acoustic startle response, improved performance in the cued version of the water maze and a clear impairment in the Y maze. Notably, the female (but not male) mutant mice showed increased anxiety. Although social isolation was effective in modifying several behaviors, it did not exacerbate any of the AD-like symptoms. Our findings demonstrated the differential susceptibility of the 3 X Tg-AD mouse line to environmental manipulations, showing that social isolation did not induce remarkable effects on the genetically determined AD-like symptoms, in contrast to what previously observed with physical exercise.

AB  - Paternal care is rare among mammals, occurring in approximate to 6% of species. California mice (Peromyscus californicus) are unusual; fathers participate extensively in raising their young and display the same components of parental care as mothers, with the exception of nursing. Parenting is a complex experience, having stressful and enriching aspects. The hippocampus is sensitive to experience and responds to both stress and environmental enrichment with changes in structure and function. In rats, where females care exclusively for offspring, parenting is associated with suppressed hippocampal adult neurogenesis. Since this effect has been causally linked to lactation, it is unlikely that fathers would show a similar change. To investigate this issue, we examined adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of California mouse fathers compared to males without pups and observed reduced adult neurogenesis. Similar effects were found in California mouse mothers. Next, we investigated whether behaviors linked to the hippocampus, namely, object recognition and novelty-suppressed feeding, were altered in fathers, and observed no substantial changes. During caregiving, suppressed adult neurogenesis does not appear to be related to changes in behaviors associated with the hippocampus, although it is possible that there are other effects on hippocampal function.

AB  - Enhancement of pattern separation could be helpful in improving the quality of normal daily learning and in treating individuals with cognitive impairment and certain psychiatric disorders. Previously, we have shown that elevating brain magnesium, by a novel magnesium compound (magnesium-l-threonate; MgT), enhances extinction of fear memory without enhancing amygdala-dependent fear memory. Here, we investigated the effects of MgT treatment on contextual-fear memory and subsequent pattern separation. Sprague-Dawley male rats were treated with MgT for 4 weeks and memory was evaluated using a spatial-context fear conditioning task. The pattern separation ability of MgT-treated rats was assessed using a spatial-context-discrimination task. MgT treatment did not enhance the retention of contextual-fear memory. Interestingly, the ability to discriminate between two, more or less distinct, contexts was enhanced in MgT-treated rats. Our results suggest that elevation of brain magnesium might be helpful in enhancing spatial-context discrimination and/or pattern separation besides preventing aversive-event-induced overgeneralization of fear.

AB  - Neonatal handling is an experimental paradigm of an early experience which permanently alters hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis fraction resulting in increased ability to cope with stress, and decreased emotionality. lit the present work we investigated the effect of neonatal handling on adult rat brain mu-opioid receptor levels, since the opioid system is known to play an important role in emotional processing, anxiety and stress responses. Neonatal handling resulted in increased levels of mu-opioid receptors in the basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei, in the CA3 and CA4 hippocampal areas, in the ventral tegmental area, the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex. Handled animals of both sexes herd lower anxiety as measured in the elevated plus maze. The increased nut receptor levels could participate in the molecular mechanisms underlying the well-documented decreased stress and anxiety responses of handled animals.

AB  - Prenatal stress (PNS) is associated with increased biological risk for mental disorders such as anxiety and depression later in life, and stress appear to be additive to the PNS influences. Among the most widely cited and accepted alternative hypotheses of anxiety and depression is dysfunction of the HPA axis, a system that is central in orchestrating the stress response. Therefore, understanding how PNS exerts profound effects on the HPA axis and stress-sensitive brain functions including anxiety and depression has significant clinical importance. In this mini-review, we will focus on novel and evolving concepts regarding the potential mechanisms underlying the short and long-term effects of PNS involving CRH peptide family. We present evidence demonstrating prenatal hypoxia exposure induced anxiety-like behavior in adult male rat offspring and CRHR1 in PVN of the hypothalamus is involved.

AB  - Background The hypothalamus plays a key role in the stress response. While early life stress (ELS) increases susceptibility to psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD), acute stress during adulthood can also precipitate MDD after ELS. Aim Here, we tested the expression of miRNAs following ELS and susceptibility to depression-like behavior and whether sex or acute stress exacerbates this response. We also tested whether environmental enrichment (Enr) promotes early life and adult behavioral stress resilience and its effect on hypothalamic miRNA and gene expression. Following rat maternal separation (MS) as an ELS model, Enr from weaning through adulthood, and restraint (RS) as acute adult stress, we tested both animal behavior and miRNA expression in the hypothalamus. Target genes and their enrichment and ontology were analyzed using bioinformatic tools. Target gene expression changes were tested using qPCR, and miRNA promoter methylation was studied using methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation qPCR. Results MS, Enr, RS, and sex altered hypothalamic miRNAs, including several previously reported in MS literature: miRs-29, - 124, - 132, - 144, - 504. Sex had a significant effect on the greatest number of miRNAs. Also, Enr reversed downregulation of miR-29b-1-5p and -301b-3p in MS. qPCR showed that MAPK6 and MMP19, targets of miR-301b-3p, were upregulated in MS and reversed by Enr. Additionally, miR-219a was hypermethylated in MS coinciding with decreased miR-219a expression. Conclusions This study found that sex plays a critical role in the hypothalamic miRNA response to both ELS and acute stress, with males expressing greater changes following postnatal stress. Moreover, enrichment significantly altered behavior as well as hypothalamic miRNA expression and their gene targets. Because of its role as the initiator of the autonomic stress response and connection to hedonic and motivational behavior, the hypothalamic miRNA landscape may significantly alter both the short and long-term behavioral response to stress.

AB  - Exposure to interpersonal violence or abuse affects the physical and emotional well-being of affected individuals. In particular, exposure to trauma during development increases the risk of psychiatric and other medical disorders beyond the risks associated with adult violence exposure. Alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a major mediating pathway of the stress response, contribute to the long-standing effects of early life trauma. Although early life trauma elevates the risk of psychiatric and medical disease, not all exposed individuals demonstrate altered HPA axis physiology, suggesting that genetic variation influences the consequences of trauma exposure. In addition, the effects of abuse may extend beyond the immediate victim into subsequent generations as a consequence of epigenetic effects transmitted directly to offspring and/or behavioral changes in affected individuals. Recognition of the biological consequences and transgenerational impact of violence and abuse has critical importance for both disease research and public health policy.

AB  - Sex differences have been reported in the susceptibility to early life stress and its neurobiological correlates in humans and experimental animals. However, most of the current research with animal models of early stress has been performed mainly in males. In the present study, prolonged maternal separation (MS) paradigm was applied as an animal model to resemble the effects of adverse early experiences in male and female rats. Regional brain mitochondrial function, monoaminergic activity, and neuroinflammation were evaluated as adults. Mitochondrial energy metabolism was greatly decreased in MS females as compared with MS males in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and the nucleus accumbens shell. In addition, MS males had lower serotonin levels and increased serotonin turnover in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. However, MS females showed increased dopamine turnover in the prefrontal cortex and increased norepinephrine turnover in the striatum, but decreased dopamine turnover in the hippocampus. Sex differences were also found for pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, with increased levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of MS males, and increased IL-6 levels in the striatum of MS females. These results evidence the complex sex- and brain region-specific long-term consequences of early life stress.

AB  - Disruptions in the social environment, such as social isolation, are distressing and can induce various behavioral and neural changes in the distressed animal. We conducted a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that long-term social isolation affects brain plasticity and alters behavior in the highly social prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). In Experiment 1. adult female prairie voles were injected with a cell division marker, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and then same-sex pair-housed (control) or single-housed (isolation) for 6 weeks. Social isolation reduced cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal differentiation and altered cell death in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the amygdala. In addition, social isolation reduced cell proliferation in the medial preoptic area and cell survival in the ventromedial hypothalamus. These data suggest that long-term social isolation affects distinct stages of adult neurogenesis in specific limbic brain regions. In Experiment 2, isolated females displayed higher levels of anxiety-like behaviors in both the open field and elevated plus maze tests and higher levels of depression-like behavior in the forced swim test than controls. Further, isolated females showed a higher level of affiliative behavior than controls, but the two groups did not differ in social recognition memory. Together, our data suggest that social isolation not only impairs cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal differentiation in limbic brain areas, but also alters anxiety-like, depression-like, and affiliative behaviors in adult female prairie voles. These data warrant further investigation of a possible link between altered neurogenesis within the limbic system and behavioral changes. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, are widely used as model species in parasitology, and in research on epilepsy and ischaemia. When kept under standard laboratory housing conditions, gerbils develop two distinctive behavioural abnormalities: stereotypic digging and bar chewing. Our work centred on assessing the mechanisms leading to these stereotypies. We aimed at finding practical housing and husbandry solutions that would prevent the development of such stereotypies in the laboratory by addressing the behavioural needs of gerbils. Faecal cortisol levels were used as a non-invasive method to compare stress reactions in gerbils housed under different conditions. Stereotypic digging was caused by the lack of a burrow in the laboratory cage, while stereotypic bar chewing was caused by premature separation of juveniles from their family before the birth of younger siblings. An integrated artificial burrow system is presented that prevents the development of stereotypic digging in gerbils, and adaptations in husbandry routines are suggested that significantly reduce the incidence of bar chewing. We conclude that simple refinement of housing is effective in improving gerbil welfare in the laboratory.

AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that adult neurogenesis, the production of new neurons in adulthood, may play a role in psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Medications and other treatments for mental disorders often promote the proliferation of new neurons; the time course for maturation and integration of new neurons in circuitry parallels the delayed efficacy of psychiatric therapies; adverse and beneficial experiences similarly affect development of mental illness and neurogenesis; and ablation of new neurons in adulthood alters the behavioral impact of drugs in animal models. At present, the links between adult neurogenesis and depression seem stronger than those suggesting a relationship between new neurons and anxiety or schizophrenia. Yet, even in the case of depression there is currently no direct evidence for a causative role. This article reviews the data relating adult neurogenesis to mental illness and discusses where research needs to head in the future.

AB  - This study has its basis in recent findings by our own and other laboratories and proposes a type of rewarded operant learning that seeks the detection of discriminatory cues as a cognitive enrichment in intensive husbandry systems. This type of cognitive enrichment has the ability to activate the intrinsically-rewarding mesolimbic brain axis when an animal acquires successful strategies to cope with environmental demands. It provides animals with the opportunity to develop positive affects through control of their environment and the anticipation of consummatory reward. If true animal welfare is considered more than simply the absence of stress and harm, provoking better affective conditions may be a suitable way of increasing the well-being of intensively-housed animals. Recent research with elaborated operant learning equipment under experimental and quasi-commercial conditions, revealed better health, reduced boredom and less maladaptive behaviour as potentially practical advantages. A number of the issues regarding the transfer of this suggested form of cognitive enrichment to large scale, commercial farming are discussed.

AB  - The experience of a single threatening situation may alter the behavior of an animal in a long-lasting way. Long-lasting changes in behavior have been induced in laboratory animals to model and investigate the development and neural substrate of human psychopathologies. Under natural conditions, however, changes in behavior after an aversive experience may be adaptive because behavioral modifications allow animals to adjust to a threat for extended periods of time. In the laboratory setting, properties of the aversive situation and the potential of the animal to respond to the threat may be altered and lead to extensive, prolonged changes, indicating a failure in behavioral regulation. Such long-term changes seem to be mediated by neuronal alterations in components of the fear pathway. To understand psychopathologies, determinants of exaggerated responsivity and the underlying molecular and neural processes have to be analyzed in a comparative way under conditions that produce normal and abnormal fear and anxiety.

AB  - Epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide, is characterized by recurrent seizures and subsequent brain damage. Despite strong evidence supporting a deleterious impact on seizure occurrence and outcome severity, stress is an overlooked component in people with epilepsy. With regard to stressor duration and timing, acute stress can be protective in epileptogenesis, while chronic stress often promotes seizure occurrence in epilepsy patients. Preclinical research suggests that chronic stress promotes neuroinflammation and leads to a depressive state. Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity in people with epilepsy, resulting in a poor quality of life. Here, we summarize studies investigating acute and chronic stress as a seizure trigger and an important factor that worsens epilepsy outcomes and psychiatric comorbidities. Mechanistic insight into the impact of stress on epilepsy may create a window of opportunity for future interventions targeting neuroinflammation-related disorders.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis continues to captivate the curiosity of the scientific community; and researchers seem to have a particular interest in identifying the functional implications of such plasticity. While the majority of research focuses on the association between adult neurogenesis and learning and memory (including spatial learning associated with hippocampal neurogenesis and olfactory discrimination associated with neurogenesis in the olfactory system), the following review will explore the link to motivated behaviors. In particular, goal-directed behaviors such as sociosexual, parental, aggressive, as well as depression- and anxiety-like behaviors and their reciprocal association to adult neurogenesis will be evaluated. The review will detail research in humans and other mammalian species. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms underlying these neurogenic alterations will be highlighted. Lastly, the review will conclude with a discussion on the functional significance of these newly generated cells in mediating goal-directed behaviors.

AB  - Greater engagement in a range of daily activities is associated with better cognitive functioning (Lee et al., Lee et al., 2020). The hippocampus, a subcortical brain structure implicated in learning, memory, spatial navigation and other aspects of cognitive functioning, may be structurally sensitive to exposure to and engagement with novel experiences and environments. The present study tested whether greater activity diversity, defined as the range of common daily activities engaged in and the proportion of time spent in each, is associated with larger hippocampal volume. Greater diversity of activities, as measured using daily diaries across an 8-day period, was related to greater hippocampal volume averaged across the left and right hemispheres, even when adjusting for estimated intracranial volume, total activity time, sociodemographic factors, and self-reported physical health. These findings are broadly consistent with nonhuman animal studies, demonstrating a link between enriched environments and structural changes to the hippocampus. Future longitudinal and experimental work can elucidate causal and directional relationships between diversity of daily activities and hippocampal volume.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and consequent dysregulation of brain maturation. Patients suffer from a range of debilitating physical symptoms, however, behavioral and emotional symptoms also severely affect their quality of life. Here, we present previously unreported and clinically relevant affective dysfunction in the female heterozygous Mecp2(tm1Tam) mouse model of RTT (129sv and C57BL6 mixed background). The affective dysfunction and aberrant anxiety-related behavior of the Mecp2(+/-) mice were found to be reversible with environmental enrichment (EE) from 4 weeks of age. The effect of exercise alone (via wheel running) was also explored, providing the first evidence that increased voluntary physical activity in an animal model of RTT is beneficial for some phenotypes. Mecp2(+/-) mutants displayed elevated corticosterone despite decreased Crh expression, demonstrating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation. EE of Mecp2(+/-) mice normalized basal serum corticosterone and hippocampal BDNF protein levels. The enrichment-induced rescue appears independent of the transcriptional regulation of the MeCP2 targets Bdnf exon 4 and Crh. These findings provide new insight into the neurodevelopmental role of MeCP2 and pathogenesis of RTT, in particular the affective dysfunction. The positive outcomes of environmental stimulation and physical exercise have implications for the development of therapies targeting the affective symptoms, as well as behavioral and cognitive dimensions, of this devastating neurodevelopmental disorder.

AB  - The Lsamp gene gives rise to limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP), which is expressed on the surface of somata and proximal dendrites of neurons. Lsamp-deficient mice have been shown to be slightly hyperactive in novel environments and less anxious, and they display alterations in swimming speed, fear reaction, fear conditioning and social behaviour. In human studies, links between the LSAMP gene and several psychiatric disorders have been found and LSAMP has been established as a tumour suppressor gene. To study the impact of environmental manipulations on the phenotype, we exposed male Lsamp-deficient mice to environmental enrichment (EE), a technique that has often been shown to abolish phenotypic deviations in knockout mice, and to social isolation, a stressful manipulation, after which all the mice were tested in a behavioural battery. EE abolished differences between the genotypes in body weight and anogenital sniffing, a behaviour related to aggressiveness, and amplified the anxiolytic-like phenotype of Lsamp-deficient mice both in the plus maze and motility box. Isolation abolished differences between the genotypes in body weight and anxiety and amplified the differences in swimming speed and anogenital sniffing. EE and isolation failed to modify the results as compared to standard housing in whisker trimming, locomotor activity, marble burying and corticosterone levels. In conclusion, Lsamp-deficient mice were less sensitive to isolation stress than their wild-type littermates. Lack of LAMP protein seemingly leads to a deterioration in the ability to adapt to novel stressful environments and stimuli. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period associated with vast neural and behavioral changes which are accompanied by altered sensitivity to stimuli, both stressful and rewarding. Perturbations, especially stressful stimuli, during this period have been shown to alter behavior in adulthood. Social isolation rearing is one such perturbation. This review highlights the long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent social isolation rearing in rodents with a specific focus on anxiety-and addiction-related behaviors. Sex-specific effects are discussed where data are available. We then consider changes in monoaminergic neurotransmission as one possible mechanism for the behavioral effects described. This research on both normative and perturbed adolescent development is crucial to understanding and treating the increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders seen in humans during this life stage.

AB  - For three decades, IBNS has provided a forum for the dissemination of behavioral neuroscience research, broadly defined. Throughout this time, research presented at the annual meetings has reflected representative trends in the field with an emphasis on relevant preclinical animal models. From its inception, IBNS has contributed to my professional development and evolving research interests. Unsurprisingly, throughout the three decades of its existence, IBNS annual programs have reflected research trends that have been thoughtfully evaluated, chal-lenged, and, in some cases, recalibrated. An emphasis in my lab, for example, has slowly navigated toward the inclusion of more diverse species (e.g., nonhuman primate models, wild rats, wild and captive raccoons) assessed in settings that reflect more ethological relevance than typically observed in traditional laboratory settings. Consequently, my research interests are pivoting from laboratory animal model exclusive (L.A.M.E.) endeavors to more natural, diverse, ethoexperimental approaches. As progress toward translational findings for psychiatric and neurological conditions is considered, it is recommended that researchers remain open to nontraditional methodological approaches that incorporate diverse animal models and assessments to inform laboratory -generated findings.

AB  - Chronic stress can impact decision-making and lead to a preference for immediate rewards rather than long-term payoffs. Factors that may influence these effects of chronic stress on decision-making are under-explored. Here we used a mouse model to investigate the changes in decision-making caused by the experience of chronic stress and the role of social isolation in exaggerating these changes. To test decision-making, mice were trained to perform a Cost-Benefit Conflict (CBC) task on a T-maze, in which they could choose between a high-reward, high-risk alternative and a low-reward, low-risk alternative. Mice were either housed in groups or alone throughout the experiment. Both groups of mice underwent a seven-day period of repeated immobilization to induce chronic stress. Stress levels were confirmed using behavioral (open field test) and physiological (urine corticosterone ELISA) measures. We found a significant increase in frequency of high-risk decisions after exposure to chronic stress among both socially- and individually-housed mice. Crucially, socially-housed mice showed a significantly smaller increase in high-risk decision-making compared to singly-housed mice. These findings suggest that chronic stress leads to an increase in high-risk decision-making in mice, and that lack of social interaction may exacerbate this stress effect.

AB  - The continuous generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus exhibits remarkable plasticity. Decreased neurogenesis is thought to underlie depression-like behaviors, and increased neurogenesis is thought to occur following antidepressant drug treatment. Studies on different strains of mice, however, yielded contrasting results with regard to the link between behavioral modifications induced by antidepressant drugs or environmental enrichment and changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study on the inbred strains Balb/c and C57B1/6 that differ substantially in emotionality, stress reactivity, and behavioral responses to chronic antidepressant drugs. Quantitative assessments of progenitor cell proliferation and immature neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus revealed that, despite significantly different basal proliferation rates between both strains, neither strain exhibited changes in adult neurogenesis after exposure to early life stress or adult chronic fluoxetine treatment. A stimulatory effect of fluoxetine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis was only detected when treatment was initiated during adolescence, and this effect was abolished in mice exposed to early life stress, a prominent risk factor for developing adult-onset depression-like behaviors. Thus, in both strains of mice neither adult fluoxetine treatment nor adolescent fluoxetine treatment following early life stress exposure increased the proliferation and early differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells.

AB  - Besides the massive plasticity at the level of synapses, we find in the hippocampus of adult mice and rats two systems with very strong macroscopic structural plasticity: adult neurogenesis, that is the lifelong generation of new granule cells, and dynamic changes in the mossy fibers linking the dentate gyrus to area CA3. In particular the anatomy of the infrapyramidal mossy fiber tract (IMF) changes in response to a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli. Because mossy fibers are the axons of granule cells, the question arises whether these two types of plasticity are linked. Using immunohistochemistry for markers associated with axonal growth and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) GFP mice to visualize the post-mitotic maturation phase of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we found that newly generated mossy fibers preferentially but not exclusively contribute to the IMF. The neurogenic stimulus of an enriched environment increased the volume of the IMF In addition, the IMF grew with a time course consistent with axonal outgrowth from the newborn neurons after the induction of neurogenic seizures using kainate. These results indicate that two aspects of plasticity in the adult hippocampus, mossy fiber size and neurogenesis, are related and may share underlying mechanisms. In a second part of this study, published separately (Krebs et al., 2011) we have addressed the question of whether there is a shared genetics underlying both traits.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that one's risk for psychiatric disturbances and metabolic syndromes is influenced by their parents' own health history, lifestyle and living environment. For example, paternal high fat diet is strongly linked to neuroendocrine dysregulation in offspring and increased risk for diabetes. The potential intergenerational impact of paternal stress has only just begun to emerge, with the initial evidence suggestive of greater risk for anxiety-related disorders. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis is a key neuroendocrine signalling system involved in physiological homeostasis and stress response. In individuals, dysregulation of this system is closely associated with behavioral deficits and mood disorders. Various preclinical models of paternal stress have demonstrated robust behavioral shifts but little is known about the intergenerational modification of HPA axis function. This review will present evidence drawn from a range of laboratory mouse and rat models that the intergenerational influence of paternal stress on offspring behavioral phenotypes involve some level of HPA axis dysregulation. It makes the case that further investigations to comprehensively profile HPA axis function in offspring generations is warranted.

AB  - The impact of a social stress in gestation and an enriched pen in lactation on components of sow maternal behavior was studied in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment. At breeding, 41 sows were assigned to a social mixing stress treatment (T) during mid-gestation or a control group (C). During lactation, half of the T and C sows were housed in straw enriched pens (E) (1.57 m x 4.10 m) and the others in standard farrowing crates (S) (0.68 m x 2.10 m). The mixing stress consisted in introducing each T sow to the home pen of two unfamiliar sows twice for 1 week, from d 39 to 45 and 59 to 65 of gestation. Aggressive behavior was observed and lesion scores were taken to confirm that a social stress occurred. During lactation, the responses of sows to a simulated piglet crush test on d 3 and an isolated piglet playback test on d 21 were observed. Postural budgets of sows were automatically detected using accelerometers on d 5 and 19 of lactation. Sow-initiated social contacts with the piglets were observed continuously from video recordings on d 6 and 20 of lactation. Data were analyzed with a mixed models procedure. The social stress treatment had an impact on the response of sows to isolated piglet vocalizations with T sows showing longer latencies to respond vocally than C sows (P = 0.035). In early lactation, T sows spent more time lying ventrally than C sows (P = 0.007). Furthermore, the social stress had an impact on the space use in the enriched housing, with T sows spending less time in the nesting straw area of the pen than C sows (P = 0.018). Housing also impacted maternal behavior with E sows tending to spend more time lying ventrally than S sows in late lactation (P = 0.067) and tending to have more social contacts with their piglets than S sows in early lactation (P = 0.058). In conclusion, the social stress during gestation had a slight negative impact on sow maternal behavior, and while an enriched farrowing pen allowed for more opportunities to express maternal behavior, it did not counteract the negative effects of gestation stress.

AB  - Depression is a complex disease affecting a considerable percentage of the world population (17-20%). Although none of the specific brain circuits has been identified yet, research including neuroimaging, post mortem studies and animal models has pointed out important regions for the physiopathology of the disease. At the same time, some neuronal processes including the stress response, the immune response, the synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity involved in the physiopatology of depression have been identified. So, several neurohormonal, neuronal and neurotrophic processes have been intensely studied in order to understand the onset and progression of depression. Among these, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the monoaminergic transmission, the neurotrophic mechanisms, neurogenesis and cytokines have been studied as important factors in depression. Recent research suggests that environment exerts a determining effect on the function of these processes. Adverse events during early development stages are able to modify gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, becoming important factors of susceptibility. On the other hand, enriched environments also modify several neurological processes, acquiring an important role in the development of the disease.

AB  - Animal welfare is the quality of life as perceived by the animal itself. It is also the state of an animal in its attempt to cope with its environment. Animal welfare has high ethics and economic importance. Thus the need to develop parameters for assessing animal welfare. An acute increase in glucocorticoid (GC) concentration is necessary for adaptation to a stressful situation. Glucocorticoids also play a significant role in metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Glucocorticoid enhances effective learning through the hippocampus and other normal body functions. That is why we remember events (either positive or negative) associated with strong emotions. Long-term secretion of GCs has catabolic effects. Thus, affecting animal health. Measuring GC is one of the ways of assessing animal welfare. But, high GC concentration does not only indicate pain or suffering. We report that stress and emotion trigger similar physiological responses. So, measuring GC levels cannot differentiate between positive and negative states. We conclude that GC shows circadian rhythms and episodic spikes in some species. Values from a single sample point are not reliable to make conclusions about a condition. Training animals for blood collection may reduce stress. Thus not causing bias in the GC concentration measured.

AB  - Aggressive behaviour results from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Key modulators of aggression include the serotonergic system on the molecular level and experience in prior aggressive contests as an environmental factor. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of fighting experience on the display of offensive aggressive behaviour in adult male mice varying in serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype. 5-HTT +/+, 5-HTT +/- and 5-HTT -/- mice were given either a winning or a losing experience on each of three consecutive days and were subsequently observed for their offensive aggressive behaviour as residents against a docile intruder from the C3H strain in a resident-intruder paradigm. The main findings were: There was no significant difference between the amount of offensive aggressive behaviour displayed by the genotypes. Winners showed more engagement with the intruder, attacked him faster and exhibited overall higher aggression scores than losers. There was no significant genotype x social experience interaction: winning and losing had a similar effect on offensive aggressive behaviour in all three 5-HTT genotypes. We conclude that social experience in terms of having been a winner or having been a loser rather than the 5-HTT genotype determines the behaviour towards a docile intruder. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Chronic stress has deleterious effects on immune function, which can lead to adverse health outcomes. However, studies investigating the impact of stress reduction interventions on immunity in clinical research have yielded divergent results, potentially stemming from differences in study design and genetic heterogeneity, among other clinical research challenges. To test the hypothesis that reducing glucocorticoid levels enhances certain immune functions, we administered influenza vaccine once (prime) or twice (boost) to mice housed in either standard control caging or environmental enrichment (EE) caging. We have shown that this approach reduces mouse corticosterone production. Compared with controls, EE mice had significantly lower levels of fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) and increased splenic B and T lymphocyte numbers. Corticosterone levels were negatively associated with the numbers of CD19(+) (r(2) = 0.43, p = 0.0017), CD4(+) (r(2) = 0.28, p = 0.0154) and CD8(+) cells (r(2) = 0.20, p = 0.0503). Vaccinated mice showed nonsignificant differences in immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer between caging groups, although EE mice tended to exhibit larger increases in titer from prime to boost than controls; the interaction between the caging group (control versus EE) and vaccine group (prime versus boost) showed a strong statistical trend (cage-group*vaccine-group, F = 4.27, p = 0.0555), suggesting that there may be distinct effects of EE caging on primary versus secondary IgG vaccine responses. Vaccine-stimulated splenocytes from boosted EE mice had a significantly greater frequency of interleukin 5 (IL-5)-secreting cells than boosted controls (mean difference 7.7, IL-5 spot-forming units/10(6) splenocytes, 95% confidence interval 0.24-135.1, p = 0.0493) and showed a greater increase in the frequency of IL-5-secreting cells from prime to boost. Our results suggest that corticosterone reduction via EE caging was associated with enhanced secondary vaccine responses, but had little effect on primary responses in mice. These findings help identify differences in primary and secondary vaccine responses in relationship to stress mediators that may be relevant in clinical studies.

AB  - Veterinary professionals (VPs) are often the first source of advice for clients struggling with their dog's behaviour, and pulling on the lead is a commonplace undesirable behaviour VPs will encounter regularly in practice. Excluding bites, being pulled over while walking on a lead is the leading cause of non-fatal dog-related injuries in the UK. This narrative review investigates lead pulling as a welfare concern in pet dogs, highlighting aspects of the literature of particular interest to VPs. Lead pulling could negatively affect walk quality, frequency and duration, causing weight gain, while decreased environmental enrichment could trigger other undesirable behaviours. Aversive equipment to prevent lead pulling can cause pain, distress and injury, but even equipment considered humane can have welfare consequences. Punitive training methods could cause dogs stress, fear and anxiety and trigger aggressive behaviour. While these lead pulling outcomes are welfare concerns in themselves, they could also weaken dog-owner attachment, a risk factor in pet dog relinquishment. Given lead pulling could affect the welfare of patients in a VPs care, clinical implications and opportunities for client education are outlined. Educating clients on humane prevention and modification of lead pulling could make walks easier, safer and more enjoyable, with positive outcomes for clients, canine welfare and the practice.

AB  - The quality of maternal care during early life has a dramatic impact on later Stress reactivity and anxiety. Two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ, differ in levels of maternal care, stress reactivity, and anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. However, the relative contribution of early environmental factors and genetic predisposition to differences in these strains is not known. Maternal care, plasma corticosterone levels, emotionality, and hippocampal and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels were measured in adult C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice. Litters were then cross-fostered and anxiety-like behavior and stress reactivity was assessed in adulthood. Significantly less maternal care and elevated stress-induced corticosterone and emotionality was observed in BALB/cJ compared to C57BL/6J mice. Yet, no strain differences were found in hippocampal or paraventricular nucleus glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels. Cross-fostering did alter anxiety-like behavior and basal corticosterone levels, which suggests that while genetic differences account for some of the variations between these two strains early rearing conditions also contribute.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis occurs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. New neurons help to counteract the effects of stress and several interventions including antidepressant drugs, environmental modifications and internal factors act pro-neurogenic with consequences in the dorsal and ventral DG. Melatonin, the main product synthesized by the pineal gland, induces antidepressant-like effects and modulates several events of the neurogenic process. However, the information related to the capability of melatonin to modulate dendrite maturation and complexity in the dorsal and ventral regions of the DG and their correlation with its antidepressant-like effect is absent. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the impact of melatonin (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg) administered daily for fourteen days on the number, dendrite complexity and distribution of doublecortin (DCX)-cells in the dorsal-ventral regions of the DG in male Balb/C mice. Doublecortin is a microtubule-associated protein that is expressed during the course of dendritic maturation of newborn neurons. Also, we analyzed the impact of melatonin on despair-like behavior in the forced swim test. We first found a significant increase in the number and higher dendrite complexity, mainly with the doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg of melatonin (81%, 122%, 78%). These cells showed more complex dendritic trees in the ventral- and the dorsal- DG. Concomitantly, the doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg of melatonin decreased depressant-like behavior (76%, 82%). Finally, the data corroborate the antidepressant-like effect of melatonin and the increasing number of doublecortin-associated cells. Besides, the data indicate that melatonin favors the number and dendrite complexity of DCX-cells in the dorsal- and ventral- region of the DG, which may explain part of the antidepressant-like effect of melatonin.

AB  - The magnitude and duration of the hormonal stress response change dramatically throughout an organism's lifespan. Although much is known about the factors that modulate stress reactivity during adulthood and how neonatal development and aging influence stress responsiveness, we know relatively little about how stress reactivity changes during the juvenile to adult transition. Recent studies in adolescent boys and girls have suggested that stress is an important factor contributing to an individual's vulnerability to various neuropsychological dysfiurctions, including anxiety, depression, and drug abuse. Thus, understanding how exposure to stressors during tins crucial period of development lead to negative consequences is of paramount importance. A growing body of literature indicates that pubertal organisms react differentially, both physiologically and behaviorally, to a stressor compared to adults. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to discuss the recent findings regarding the pubertal maturation of stress reactivity, while also highlighting future research directions that will aid in our understanding of stress and adolescent mental health and development.

AB  - The past decade has revealed neuroinflammation as an important mechanism of major depressive disorder (MDD). Nod-like receptors family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the key regulator interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) maturation, whose activation has been reported in MDD patients and various animal models. Function as a dominant driver of neuroinflammation, NLRP3 bridges the gap between immune activation with stress exposure, and further leads to subsequent occurrence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as MDD. Of note, autophagy is a tightly regulated cellular degradation pathway that removes damaged organelles and intracellular pathogens, and maintains cellular homeostasis from varying insults. Serving as a critical cellular monitoring system, normal functioned autophagy signaling prevents excessive NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent release of IL-1 family cytokines. This review will describe the current understanding of how autophagy regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activity and discuss the implications of this regulation on the pathogenesis of MDD. The extensive crosstalk between autophagy pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome is further discussed, as it is critical for developing new therapeutic strategies for MDD aimed at modulating the neuro-inflammatory responses.

AB  - Although the literature reports a higher incidence of anxiety disorders in women, the majority of basic research has focused on male rodents, thus resulting in a lack of knowledge on the neurobiology of anxiety in females. Bridging this gap is crucial for the design of effective translational interventions in women. One of the key brain mechanisms likely to regulate anxious behavior is adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). This review paper aims to discuss the evidence on the differences between male and female rodents with regard to anxiety-related behavior and physiology, with a special focus on AHN. The differences between male and female physiologies are greatly influenced by hormonal differences. Gonadal hormones and their fluctuations during the estrous cycle have often been identified as agents responsible for sexual dimorphism in behavior and AHN. During sexual maturity, hormone levels fluctuate cyclically in females more than in males, increasing the stress response and the susceptibility to anxiety. It is therefore of great importance that future research investigates anxiety and other neurophysiological aspects in the female model, so that results can be more accurately applicable to the female population.

AB  - Although individual environmental factors influence behavioral plasticity, animals live in complex environments wherein multiple environmental factors vary simultaneously. Here, we investigated whether temperature and food intake independently or interactively affected the boldness and feeding behavior of juvenile corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus, Linnaeus). Because thermal environments in which animals can behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e., multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food availability) may be an overly simplistic approach to understanding how animals respond to rapidly changing environments.

AB  - In this study, observations on traditional methods, such as open field test, corticosterone assays and monitoring of barbiturate sleeping time. were performed to validate the impact of housing conditions on the welfare of rats and mice in order to compare the outcome with observations previously achieved by preference tests and telemetry. These traditional methods failed to demonstrate the impact on the animals caused by grid housing previously shown by telemetry and preference studies, and it is. therefore, concluded that these traditional tests may be less sensitive for monitoring subtle small environmental impacts on laboratory rodents.
   Although, the methods were not able to reveal any differences in corticosterone level and open field test between housing conditions, there were significant differences between mouse strains and sexes. These differences between strains should be taken into account when choosing the best suitable strain for a study.

AB  - Stereotypic behaviours are commonly observed in captive animals and are usually interpreted as a sign of poor welfare. Stereotypies have also been linked with brain abnormalities. However, stereotypies are a heterogeneous class of behaviours and mounting evidence indicates that different stereotypies can have different causes, and can be linked to different affective states. As a consequence, the implications of a specific stereotypy in a specific species cannot be safely inferred from evidence on other stereotypies or species. Here we review what is known about pacing behaviour in laboratory rhesus macaques, a common stereotypy in this species. Our review highlights the current lack of understanding of the causal factors underlying pacing behaviour. According to current knowledge, the welfare of pacing macaques could be either better, worse or equivalent to that of non pacing individuals. It is also unclear whether pacing results from brain abnormalities. Since rhesus macaques are widely used as a model of healthy humans in neuroscience research, determining if pacing behaviour reflects an abnormal brain and/or poor welfare is urgent.

AB  - Sickness can change our mood for the worse, leaving us sad, lethargic, grumpy and less socially inclined. This mood change is part of a set of behavioral symptoms called sickness behavior and has features in common with core symptoms of depression. Therefore, the physiological changes induced by immune activation, for example following infection, are in the spotlight for explaining mechanisms behind mental health challenges such as depression. While humans may take a day off and isolate themselves until they feel better, farm animals housed in groups have only limited possibilities for social withdrawal. We suggest that immune activation could be a major factor influencing social interactions in pigs, with outbreaks of damaging behavior such as tail biting as a possible result. The hypothesis presented here is that the effects of several known risk factors for tail biting are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteins produced by the immune system, and their effect on neurotransmitter systems. We describe the background for and implications of this hypothesis.

AB  - Environmental variables and husbandry practices can influence physiology and alter behavior in mice. Our study evaluated the effects of cage change on serum corticosterone levels and anxiety-like behaviors in C57BL/6 male mice. We examined the effects of 3 different methods of performing cage transfer and of transferring mice to a clean or a dirty familiar cage microenvironment. The 3 different handling methods were forceps transfer, gentle transfer with gloved hands, and a passive transfer technique that did not involve active handling. Active handling methods and transfer to both clean and dirty cage microenvironments significantly increased serum corticosterone 15 min after cage change; however, at 60 min after cage change, levels were comparable to those of unmanipulated mice. Although the effects were transient, cage change altered anxiety-like behaviors in the open field when behavioral testing was performed on the same day. These results demonstrate that the timing of cage change can influence behavioral results, an effect that is an important consideration for rodent behavioral studies.

AB  - Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is the maternally inherited mitochondrial disease caused by homoplasmic mutations in mitochondrial electron transport chain Complex I subunit genes. The mechanism of its incomplete penetrance is still largely unclear. In this study, we created the patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from MT-ND4 mutated LHON-affected patient, asymptomatic mutation carrier and healthy control, and differentiated them into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We found the defective neurite outgrowth in affected RGCs, but not in the carrier RGCs which had significant expression of SNCG gene. We observed enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in affected and carrier derived RGCs. Surprisingly, we observed increased NADH dehydrogenase enzymatic activity of Complex I in hiPSC-derived RGCs of asymptomatic carrier, but not of the affected patient. LHON mutation substantially decreased basal respiration in both affected and unaffected carrier hiPSCs, and had the same effect on spare respiratory capacity, which ensures normal function of mitochondria in conditions of increased energy demand or environmental stress. The expression of antioxidant enzyme catalase was decreased in affected and carrier patient hiPSC-derived RGCs as compared to the healthy control, which might indicate to higher oxidative stress-enriched environment in the LHON-specific RGCs. Microarray profiling demonstrated enhanced expression of cell cycle machinery and downregulation of neuronal specific genes.

AB  - Individuals of many species across the animal kingdom are found to be less plastic than expected, even in behavioral traits. The existence of consistent behavioral differences between individuals, termed "personality differences", is puzzling, since plastic behavior is considered ideal to enable animals to adaptively respond to changes in environmental conditions. In order to elucidate which mechanisms are important for the evolution of personality differences, it is crucial to understand which aspects of the environment are important for the development of personality differences. Here, we tested whether physical or social aspects of the environment during development influence individual differentiation (mean level of behavior) using the jumping spider Marpissa muscosa. Furthermore, we assessed whether those behaviors were repeatable, i.e. whether personalities existed. We applied a split-brood design and raised spider siblings in three different environments: a deprived environment with no enrichment, a socially and a physically enriched environment. We focused on exploratory behavior and repeatedly assessed individual behavior in a novel environment and a novel object test. Results show that the environment during development influenced spider's exploratory tendencies: spiders raised in enriched environments tended to be more exploratory. Most investigated behaviors were repeatable (i.e., personalities existed) across all individuals tested, whereas only few behaviors were also repeatable across individuals that had experienced the same environmental condition. Taken together, our results indicate that external stimuli can influence the development of one aspect of personality, the inter-individual variation (mean level of behavior), in a jumping spider. We also found family by environment interactions on behavioral traits potentially suggesting genetic variation in developmental plasticity.

AB  - Urine marking in cats is one of the most recurrent pathologies observed in clinical consults. The cause can be (amongst others) stress, anxiety, litter box aversion, hormonal disturbance, or territoriality or other responses to other cats. In addition to environmental enrichment, treatment consists of sterilization and/or the use of pheromones, and in some cases is complemented with drug therapy; the use of buspirone is considered appropriate. The goal of this study was to evaluate, with a clinical study, significant differences between oral and transdermal buspirone administration. Individual evaluation and directed selection established two experimental groups. Patients in Group 1 were given buspirone tablets and patients in Group 2 were given buspirone in the form of pluronic lecithin organogel. Effects were evaluated after 35 days of treatment. Statistical analysis of results indicated no significant differences between oral and transdermal administration on the reduction in frequency of urine marking. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in marking frequency was observed following treatment (p<.05) for both forms of buspirone administration.

AB  - The neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous systems are known regulators of brain-immune interaction. However, the functional significance of this interaction under stress is not fully understood. We investigated the effect of a stress paradigm by applying electric foot shock followed by three reminders, on behavior, immune parameters, and lymphoma tumor growth. Male C3H mice were divided into two groups: Group 1-exposed to electric foot shock followed by three reminders, and Group 2-untreated (controls). Sets of mice underwent the elevated plus maze, staircase, and hot plate tests. After foot shock, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and lymphocyte proliferation were measured. In addition, sets of mice were either vaccinated twice with B-cell lymphoma 38C-13 immunoglobulin for determination of anti-idiotype (Id) antibodies in sera, or inoculated with tumor cells and monitored for tumor development and survival time. Mice exposed to electric foot shock followed by the three reminders had higher NK cell activity, levels of anti-Id antibodies, and a higher proliferation rate of splenocytes in response to mitogens, than the control mice. The exposed mice also showed attenuated tumor growth. Thus, the stress paradigm inhibited tumor development and lead to some immune changes that were not accompanied by behavioral changes.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the performance of BALB/c mice in Morris water maze task under two different illumination (bright and dim light) conditions. The results show that BALB/c mice could not complete the Morris water maze task under bright light (BLC), but performed very well under dim light (DLC). Animals that swam under BLC had a higher serum corticosterone level than those under DLC. Animals pretrained under DLC had a lower serum corticosterone level than those directly exposed to BLC. Our results also show that animals under BLC had a higher level of thigmotaxis (a behavioral anxiety measure during testing) than under DLC. Correlation analysis shows that corticosterone and thigmotaxis levels have a positive correlation with escape latency, indicating that corticosterone and thigmotaxis levels have a negative correlation with learning/memory performance. These results suggest that BALB/c mice have the ability to learn a spatial task; under BLC, they performed poorly owing to a high level of thigmotaxis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adolescence has lately been recognized as a key developmental phase during which an individual's behavior can be shaped. In a recent study with male mice varying in the expression of the serotonin transporter, escapable adverse social experiences during adolescence led to decreased anxiety-like behavior and increased exploratory and aggressive behavior compared to throughout beneficial experiences. Since in this study some behavioral tests took place with a delay of one week after the last social experiences have been made, it was not clear whether the observed effects really reflected the consequences of the experienced different social environments. To test this, the present study focused on the direct effects of beneficial and adverse social experiences on aggressiveness and anxiety-like behavior in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast to the previous study, behavioral testing took place immediately after the last social experiences had been made. Interestingly, whereas individuals from an escapable adverse environment showed significantly lower levels of anxiety-like and higher levels of exploratory behavior than animals from a beneficial environment, aggressive behavior was not affected. From this, we conclude that different social experiences during adolescence exert immediate effects on anxiety-like but not aggressive behavior in male mice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Lack of physical activity and increased levels of stress contribute to the development of multiple physical and mental disorders. An increasing number of studies relate voluntary exercise with greater resilience to psychological stress, a process that is highly regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise on stress resilience are still poorly understood. Here we have studied the impact of long term exercise and housing conditions on: a) hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1), b) epigenetic regulation of Nr3c1 (DNA methylation at the Nr3c1-1F promoter and miR-124 expression), c) anxiety (elevated plus maze, EPM), and d) adrenal gland weight and adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor (Mc2r) expression.
   Results: Exercise increased Nr3c1 and Nr3c1-1F expression and decreased miR-124 levels in the hippocampus in single-housed mice, suggesting enhanced resilience to stress. The opposite was found for pair-housed animals. Bisulfite sequencing showed virtually no DNA methylation in the Nr3c1-1F promoter region. Single-housing increased the time spent on stretch attend postures. Exercise decreased the time spent at the open arms of the EPM, however, the mobility of the exercise groups was significantly lower. Exercise had opposite effects on the adrenal gland weight of single and pair-housed mice, while it had no effect on adrenal Mc2r expression.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that exercise exerts a positive impact on stress resilience in single-housed mice that could be mediated by decreasing miR-124 and increasing Nr3c1 expression in the hippocampus. However, pair-housing reverses these effects possibly due to stress from dominance disputes between pairs.

AB  - The identification of cognitive bias has become an important measure of animal welfare. Negative cognitive biases develop from a tendency for animals to process novel information pessimistically. Judgment-bias testing is the commonplace methodology to detect cognitive biases. However, concerns with these methods have been frequently-reported; one of which being the discrepancy between male and female cognitive expression. The current study assessed the factors of social status and oestrus, to investigate whether oestrous cycle rotation, or subordination stress encouraged an increase in pessimistic responses. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 24) were trained on an active-choice judgment bias paradigm. Responses to the ambiguous probe were recorded as optimistic or pessimistic. Oestrous phase was determined by assessing vaginal cytology in stained vaginal cell smears. Rats in the dioestrous phase and those rats considered to be subordinate demonstrated an increased percentage of pessimistic responses. However, no interaction between these factors was observed. This suggests that oestrous cyclicity can influence the judgment biases of female animals; a previously unreported finding. On this basis, researchers should be encouraged to account for both oestrous phase cyclicity and social status as an additional fixed effect in study design.

AB  - The effect of oxytocin on cognitive bias was investigated in rats in a modified conditioned place preference paradigm. Fifteen male rats were trained to discriminate between two different cue combinations, one paired with palatable foods (reward training), and the other paired with unpalatable food (aversive training). Next, their reactions to two ambiguous cue combinations were evaluated and their latency to contact the goal pot recorded. Rats were injected with either oxytocin (OT) or saline with the prediction that rats administered OT would display a shorter average latency to approach on ambiguous trials. There was no significant difference between latencies to approach on ambiguous trials compared to reward trials, but the rats were significantly slower on the aversive compared to the ambiguous conditions. Oxytocin did not affect approach time; however, it was unclear, after follow-up testing, whether the OT doses tested were sufficient to produce the desired effects on cognitive bias. Future research should consider this possibility.

AB  - Animals housed in impoverished cages are often labelled 'bored'. They have also been called 'apathetic' or 'depressed', particularly when profoundly inactive. However, these terms are rarely operationally defined and validated. As a negative state caused by under-stimulation, boredom should increase interest in stimuli of all kinds. Apathy (lack of interest), by contrast, should manifest as decreased interest in all stimuli, while anhedonia (loss of pleasure, a depressive symptom) should specifically decrease interest in normally rewarding stimuli. We tested the hypotheses that mink, a model carnivore, experience more boredom, depression-like apathy, or anhedonia in non-enriched (NE) cages than in complex, enriched (E) cages. We exposed 29 subjects (13 E, 16 NE) to ten stimuli categorized a priori as aversive (e.g. air puffs), rewarding (e.g. evoking chasing) or ambiguous/neutral (e.g. candles). Interest in stimuli was assessed via latencies to contact, contact durations, and durations oriented to stimuli. NE mink contacted all stimuli faster (P=0.003) than E mink, and spent longer oriented to/in contact with them, albeit only significantly so for ambiguous ones (treatment*type P<0.013). With stimulus category removed from statistical models, interest in all stimuli was consistently higher among NE mink (P<0.0001 for all measures). NE mink also consumed more food rewards (P=0.037). Finally, we investigated whether lying down while awake and stereotypic behaviour (both increased by NE housing) predicted these responses. Lying awake positively co-varied with certain measures of increased exploration. In contrast, stereotypic 'scrabbling' or locomotion (e.g. pacing) did not. Overall, NE mink showed no evidence of apathy or depression, but instead a heightened investigation of diverse stimuli consistent with boredom. This state was potentially indicated by spending much time lying still but awake (although this result requires replication). Boredom can thus be operationalized and assessed empirically in non-human animals. It can also be reduced by environmental enrichment.

AB  - Simple Summary Herein, we propose that there should be discussion about the function and effects of stereotypies in relation to the time during which they are shown. In the first stages, stereotypies may help animals deal with challenges. However, behavior can potentially alter the brain, impairing its function due the absence of a diverse repertory, and change brain connections, neurophysiology and later neuroanatomy. The neuroanatomical changes in individuals showing stereotypies could be an effect rather than a cause of the stereotypy. As a consequence, studies showing different outcomes for animal welfare from stereotypy expression could be due to variation in a timeline of expression. Stereotypies are widely used as an animal welfare indicator, and their expression can tell us about psychological states. However, there are questions about the longer-term consequences if animals express stereotypies: do the stereotypies help in coping? During the prenatal period, stereotypic behavior expressed by the mother can change the phenotype of the offspring, especially regarding emotionality, one mechanism acting via methylation in the limbic system in the brain. Are individuals that show stereotypies for shorter or longer periods all better adjusted, and hence have better welfare, or is the later welfare of some worse than that of individuals that do not show the behavior? Stereotypies comprise a wide range of repeated and apparently functionless behaviors that develop in individuals whose neural condition or environment results in poor welfare. While stereotypies are an indicator of poor welfare at the time of occurrence, they may have various consequences. Environmental enrichment modifies causal factors and reduces the occurrence of stereotypies, providing evidence that stereotypies are an indicator of poor welfare. However, stereotypy occurrence and consequences change over time. Furthermore, there are complex direct and epigenetic effects when mother mammals that are kept in negative conditions do or do not show stereotypies. It is proposed that, when trying to deal with challenging situations, stereotypies might initially help animals to cope. After further time in the conditions, the performance of the stereotypy may impair brain function and change brain connections, neurophysiology and eventually neuroanatomy. It is possible that reported neuroanatomical changes are an effect of the stereotypy rather than a cause.

AB  - The enzyme 5 alpha-Reductase (5 alpha-R) catalyzes the formation of dihydrotestosterone, which is involved in male pattern hair loss and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finasteride inhibits 5 alpha-R and is used to treat both these conditions. Several clinical studies show that chronic finasteride treatment induces persistent depression, suicidal thoughts, and cognitive impairment. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects of finasteride are not known and it is imperative that an animal model that mimics the clinical neuropsychiatric effects of finasteride is developed. Accordingly, we evaluated the behavioral effects of acute and repeated finasteride administration. Two months old male Wistar rats were administered with either vehicle (hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin) or different doses of finasteride, subcutaneously, either acutely (30 min or 2 h) or for 1, 3, and 6 days (one dose per day). Behavioral despair and motivational behavior were evaluated in the forced swim test (FST) and splash test, respectively. FST and splash test were video-recorded and analyzed offline. Finasteride did not show any effects in the acute, one day or three days studies in the FST. However, repeated finasteride administration for 6 days significantly increased the immobility time. In the splash test, finasteride (100 mg/kg) administration increased the latency to groom and decreased the grooming duration implying lack of motivation in the three-day study. In the six-day study, latency to groom was significantly increased by the 100 mg/Kg dose. Further, a significant dose dependent decrease in the grooming duration was observed. In summary, our results indicate that repeated finasteride administration induces depression-like behavior in rats. This study provides the evidence that an animal model of finasteride-induced depression is feasible to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms, and the pharmacology underlying the neuropsychiatric effects of finasteride. Further, these results provide insights into the potential involvement of neurosteroids in depression and will lead to the development of novel therapeutics for its treatment.

AB  - The hippocampus, a major site of neurogenesis in the adult brain, plays an important role in memory. Based on earlier observations where exposure to high-intensity noise not only caused hearing loss but also impaired memory function, it is conceivably that noise exposure may suppress hippocampal neurogenesis. To evaluate this possibility, nine rats were unilaterally exposed for 2 h to a high-intensity, narrow band of noise centered at 12 kHz at 126 dB SPL. The rats were also screened for noise-induced tinnitus, a potential stressor which may suppress neurogenesis. Five rats developed persistent tinnitus-like behavior while the other four rats showed no signs of tinnitus. Age-matched sham controls showed no signs of hearing loss or tinnitus. The inner ear and hippocampus were evaluated for sensory hair cell loss and neurogenesis 10 weeks post-exposure. All noise exposed rats showed severe loss of sensory hair cells in the noise-exposed ear, but essentially no damage in the unexposed ear. Frontal sections from the hippocampus were immunolabeled for doublecortin to identify neuronal precursor cells, or Ki67 to label proliferating cells. Noise-exposed rats showed a significant reduction of neuronal precursors and fewer dividing cells as compared to sham controls. However, we could not detect any difference between rats with behavioral evidence of tinnitus versus rats without tinnitus. These results show for the first time that high intensity noise exposure not only damages the cochlea but also causes a significant and persistent decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis that may contribute to functional deficits in memory.

AB  - A substantial number of new granule neurons are produced in the dentate gyrus in adulthood in a variety of mammalian species, including humans. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the production and survival of new hippocampal neurons can be enhanced or diminished by hormones and experience. Steroid hormones of the oval-ies and adrenal glands have been shown to modulate the production of immature neurons by affecting the proliferation of granule cell precursors. Aversive experiences have been demonstrated to decrease the production of immature granule cells, whereas enriching experiences, including learning, have been shown to enhance the survival of new hippocampal cells. These studies indicate that adult-generated neurons represent a unique form of structural plasticity that can be regulated by the environment, and furthermore suggest that new neurons play an important role in hippocampal function.

AB  - A series of Ce0.1TiOx, Cu0.1Ox and CumCe0.1-mTiOx (m = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) catalysts are prepared via a sol-gel method for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH3. The samples are mainly characterized by Xray diffraction (XRD), Raman, H-2-TPR, NH3-TPD, separated NO/NH3 oxidation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to investigate the properties of the catalysts. Among the CumCe0.1-mTiOx (m = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) catalysts, Cu0.01Ce0.09TiOx displays much better catalytic activity in the range of 170 degrees C-425 degrees C ( > 90% NO conversion), N-2 selectivity and resistance of SO2 and H2O even at high gas hourly space velocity. The XPS results verify that the introduction of Cu leads to a copper species enrichment environment and the formation of more surface Ce3+ and absorbed oxygen (O-alpha), which are in favor of the oxidation of NO to NO2, enhancing the activity at low temperature. Furthermore, in situ DRIFTS results confirm that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism is predominant in the NH3-SCR process for the Cu0.01Ce0.09TiOx catalyst at 150 degrees C.

AB  - Background The effectiveness of recorded harp music as a tool for relaxation for non-human primates is explored in this study.
   Methods Konigsberg Instruments Model T27F-113 cardiovascular telemetry devices were implanted into nine African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops). After post-surgical recovery, animals were exposed to recorded harp music. Telemetry data were collected on heart rate, mean blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature for a 30-minute baseline period before music exposure; a 90-minute period of music exposure; and a 90-minute post-exposure period, where no music was played.
   Results No statistical differences were noted in heart rate, mean blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature between pre-exposure, exposure, and post-exposure periods.
   Conclusions The lack of response in these African green monkeys may be attributable to their generally calm demeanor in captivity; experiments with a more excitable species such as the rhesus macaque might demonstrate a significant relaxation response to music.

AB  - Housing conditions represent an important environmental variable playing a critical role in the assessment of mouse behaviour. In the present study the effects of isolation and nesting material on the behaviour of female C57BL/6J mice were evaluated. The mice were subjected to different rearing conditions from weaning (at the age of 3 weeks). The study groups were group- and single-housed mice, divided further into groups with or without nesting material (species-specific enrichment). After 8 weeks spent in respective conditions the behavioural testing began. Both factors (social conditions and nesting material) appeared to have a significant impact on the behavioural phenotype. However, it is important to stress that the interaction between the factors was virtually absent. We established that isolation increased locomotor activity and reduced anxiety-like behaviour in several tests of exploration. In contrast, absence of nesting material increased anxiety-like behaviour. Neither factor affected rota-rod performance, nociception and prepulse inhibition. Contextual fear memory was significantly reduced in single-housed mice, and interestingly, in mice with nesting material. Cued fear memory was reduced by single-housing, but not affected by enrichment. Mice from enriched cages displayed faster and better learning and spatial search strategy in the water maze. In contrast, isolation caused significant impairment in the water maze. In conclusion, both isolation and species-specific enrichment have profound effects on mouse behaviour and should be considered in design of the experiments and in assessment of animal welfare issues.

AB  - Adult-born neurons are continually produced in the dentate gyrus but it is unclear whether synaptic integration of new neurons affects the pre-existing circuit. Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that Bax deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit.

AB  - Two-way active avoidance (TWAA) acquisition constitutes a particular case of approach -avoidance conflict for laboratory rodents. The present article reviews behavioural, psychopharmacological and neuroanatomical evidence accumulated along more than fifty years that provides strong support to the contention that anxiety is critical in the transition from CS (conditioned stimulus)-induced freezing to escape/avoidance responses during the initial stages of TWAA acquisition. Thus, anxiolytic drugs of different types accelerate avoidance acquisition, anxiogenic drugs impair it, and avoidance during these initial acquisition stages is negatively associated with other typical measures of anxiety. In addition behavioural and developmental treatments that reduce or increase anxiety/stress respectively facilitate or impair TWAA acquisition. Finally, evidence for the regulation of TWAA acquisition by septo-hippocampal and amygdala-related mechanisms is discussed. Collectively, the reviewed evidence gives support to the initial acquisition of TWAA as a paradigm with considerable predictive and (in particular) construct validity as an approach-avoidance conflict-based rodent anxiety model.

AB  - Experimenters and treatment methods are the major contributors to data variability in behavioral neuroscience. However, home cage characteristics are likely associated with data variability. Mice housed in breeding cages spontaneously exhibit behavioral patterns such as biting into the wire grid and climbing on the grid lid. We aimed to clarify the effect of covering the stainless steel wire grid lid in commonly used home cage with Plexiglas to prevent climbing on muscle strength in mice. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of climbing prevention on activity and anxiety-like behavior, and the impact of climbing prevention during the postnatal development period and adulthood on muscle strength. Muscle strength, anxiety-like behavior, and locomotor activity were assessed by a battery of tests (wire hang, suspension, grip strength, rotarod, elevated-plus maze, and open field tests). Mice prevented from climbing the wire grid during postnatal development displayed lower muscle strength than those able to climb. Moreover, mice prevented from climbing for 3 weeks following maturity had weakened muscles. The muscle strength was decreased with 3 weeks of climbing prevention in even 1-year-old mice. In summary, the stainless steel wire grid in the home cage contributed to the development and maintenance of muscle strength in mice.

AB  - The effect of stress on the mRNA and protein level of the 5-HT1A receptor and two of its key transcriptional modulators, NUDR and Freud-1, was examined in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (Hp) using rodent models: olfactory bulbectomy (OB) and prenatal stress (PS) in male and female rats; chronic mild stress in male rats (CMS) and pregnancy stress.
   In PFC, CMS induced the most widespread changes, with significant reduction in both mRNA and protein levels of NUDR, 5-HT1A receptor and in Freud-1 mRNA; while in Hp 5-HT1A receptor and Freud-1 protein levels were also decreased. In male, but not female OB rats PFC Freud-1 and 5-HT1A receptor protein levels were reduced, while in Hp 5-HT1A receptor, Freud-1 and NUDR mRNA's but not protein were reduced. In PS rats PFC 5-HT1A receptor protein was reduced more in females than males; while in Hp Freud-1 protein was increased in females. In pregnancy stress, PFC NUDR, Freud-1 and 5-HT1A protein receptor levels were reduced, and in HP 5-HT1A receptor protein levels were also reduced; in HP only NUDR and Freud-1 mRNA levels were reduced. Overall, CMS and stress during pregnancy produced the most salient changes in 5-HT1A receptor and transcription factor expression, suggesting a primary role for altered transcription factor expression in chronic regulation of 5-HT1A receptor expression. By contrast, OB (in males) and PS (in females) produced gender-specific reductions in PFC 5-HT1A receptor protein levels, suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation. These and previous data suggest that chronic stress might be a key regulator of NUDR/Freud-1 gene expression.

AB  - The subjective measures used to study mood disorders in humans cannot be replicated in animals; however, the increasing application of objective neuropsychological methods provides opportunities to develop translational animal tasks. Here we describe a novel behavioral approach, which has enabled us to investigate similar affective biases in rodents. In our affective bias test (ABT), rats encounter two independent positive experiences-the association between food reward and specific digging substrate-during discrimination learning sessions. These are performed on separate days under either neutral conditions or during a pharmacological or affective state manipulation. Affective bias is then quantified using a preference test where both previously rewarded substrates are presented together and the rat's choices recorded. The absolute value of the experience is kept consistent and all other factors are counterbalanced so that any bias at recall can be attributed to treatment. Replicating previous findings from studies in healthy volunteers, we observe significant positive affective biases following acute treatment with typical (fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine) and atypical antidepressants (agomelatine, mirtazapine), and significant negative affective biases following treatment with drugs associated with inducing negative affective states in humans (FG7142, rimonabant, 13-cis retinoic acid). We also observed that acute psychosocial stress and environmental enrichment induce significant negative and positive affective biases, respectively, and provide evidence that these affective biases involve memory consolidation. The positive and negative affective biases induced in our test also mirror the antidepressant and pro-depressant effects of these drugs in patients suggesting our test has both translational and predictive validity. Our results suggest that cognitive affective biases could contribute to drug-or stress-induced mood changes in people and support the hypothesis that a cognitive neuropsychological mechanism contributes to antidepressant drug efficacy.

AB  - Social isolation of rodents during development is thought to be a relevant model of early-life chronic stress. We investigated the effects of early-life social isolation on later adult fear and anxiety behavior, and on corticosterone stress responses, in male rats. On postnatal day 21, male rats were either housed in isolation or in groups of 3 for a 3 week period, after which, all rats were group-reared for an additional 2 weeks. After the 5-week treatment, adult rats were examined for conditioned fear, open Held anxiety-like behavior, social interaction behavior and corticosterone responses to restraint stress. Isolates exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors in a brightly-lit open field during the first 10 min of the test period compared to group-reared rats. Isolation-reared rats also showed increased fear behavior and reduced social contact in a social interaction test, and a transient increase in fear behavior to a conditioned stimulus that predicted foot-shock. Isolation-reared rats showed similar restraint-induced increases in plasma corticosterone as group-reared controls, but plasma corticosterone levels 2 h after restraint were significantly lower than pre-stress levels in isolates. Overall, this study shows that isolation restricted to an early part of development increases anxiety-like and fear behaviors in adulthood, and also results in depressed levels of plasma corticosterone following restraint stress.

AB  - Describing certain animal behaviours as 'depression-like' or 'depressive' has become common across several fields of research. These typically involve unusually low activity or unresponsiveness and/or reduced interest in pleasure (anhedonia). While the term 'depression-like' carefully avoids directly claiming that animals are depressed, this narrative review asks whether stronger conclusions can be legitimate, with animals developing the clinical disorder as seen in humans (cf., DSM-V/ICD-10). Here, we examine evidence from animal models of depression (especially chronically stressed rats) and animals experiencing poor welfare in conventional captive conditions (e.g., laboratory mice and production pigs in barren environments). We find troubling evidence that animals are indeed capable of experiencing clinical depression, but demonstrate that a true diagnosis has yet to be confirmed in any case. We thus highlight the importance of investigating the co-occurrence of depressive criteria and discuss the potential welfare and ethical implications of animal depression.

AB  - Early stimulation has been shown to produce long-lasting effects in many species. Prenatal exposure to some strong stressors may affect development of the nervous system leading to behavioral impairment in adult life. The purpose of the present work was to study the postnatal harmful effects of exposure to variable mild stresses in rats during pregnancy. Female Holtzman rats were submitted daily to one session of a chronic variable stress (CVS) during pregnancy (prenatal stress; PS group). Control pregnant rats (C group) were undisturbed. The pups of PS and C darns were weighed and separated into two groups 48 h after delivery. One group was maintained with their own dams (PS group, N = 70; C group, N = 36) while the other PS pups were cross-fostered with C dams (PSF group, N = 47) and the other C pups were cross-fostered with PS dams (CF group, N = 58). Pups were undisturbed until weaning (postnatal day 28). The male offspring underwent motor activity tests (day 28), enriched environment tests (day 37) and social interaction tests (day 42) in an animal activity monitor. Body weight was recorded on days 2, 28 and 60. The PS pups showed lower birth weight than C pups (Duncan's test, P<0.05). The PS pups suckling with their stressed mothers displayed greater preweaning mortality (C: 23%, PS: 60%; chi(2) test, P<0.05) and lower body weight than controls at days 28 and 60 (Duncan's test, P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). The PS, PSF and CF groups showed lower motor activity scores than controls when tested at day 28 (Duncan's test, P<0.01 for PS group and P<0.05 for CF and PSF groups). In the enriched environment test performed on day 37, between-group differences in total motor activity were not detected; however, the PS, CF and PSF groups displayed less exploration time than controls (Duncan's test, P<0.05). Only the PS group showed impaired motor activity and impaired social behavior at day 42 (Duncan's test, P<0.05). In fact, CVS treatment during gestation plus suckling with a previously stressed mother caused long-lasting physical and behavioral changes in rats. Cross-fostering PS-exposed pups to a dam which was not submitted to stress counteracted most of the harmful effects of the treatment. It is probable that prenatal stress plus suckling from a previously stressed mother can induce long-lasting changes in the neurotransmitter systems involved in emotional regulation. Further experiments using neurochemical and pharmacological approaches would be interesting in this model.

AB  - Daily handling of preweanling rats reduces their adult anxiety. Even routine cage-cleaning, involving handling, reduces adult anxiety compared with controls. Cage-cleaning regimes differ between animal breeders, potentially affecting rodent anxiety and experimental results. Here, 92 adult male rats given different cage-cleaning rates as pups, were compared on plus-maze, hyponeophagia, corticosterone, and handling tests. They were pair-housed and half were tail-marked-for identification. Anxiery/stress profiles were unaffected by cage-cleaning frequency, suggesting that commercial-typical differences in husbandry contribute little variance to adult rat behavior. However delivery batch affected some elevated plus-maze measures. Also, tail-marked rats spent three times longer on the plus-maze open arms than their unmarked cagemates, suggesting reduced anxiety, yet paradoxically they showed greater chomodacryorrhoea responses to handling, implying increased aversion to human contact. A follow-up study showed that rats avoided the odor released from the marker pen used. Thus, apparently trivial aspects of procedure can greatly affect experimental results.

AB  - Treatments for endometriosis include pharmacological or surgical procedures that produce significant side effects. We aimed to determine how environmental enrichment (EE) could impact the progression of endometriosis using the autotransplantation rat model. Female rats were exposed to EE (endo-EE: toys and nesting materials, 4 rats per cage, larger area enclosure) or no enrichment (endo-NE: 2 rats per cage) starting on postnatal day 21. After 8 weeks, sham surgery or surgical endometriosis was induced by suturing uterine horn tissue next to the intestinal mesentery, then allowed to progress for 60 days during which EE or NE continued. At the time of killing, we measured anxiety behaviors, collected endometriotic vesicles and uterus, and processed for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), urocortin-1, CRH receptors type 1 and type 2, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Endometriosis did not affect anxiety-like behaviors, yet rats in enriched conditions showed lower basal anxiety behaviors than the nonenriched group. Importantly, the endo-EE group showed a 28% reduction in the number of endometriosis vesicles and the vesicles were significantly smaller compared to the endo-NE group. Endometriosis increased CRH and GR only in the vesicles of endo-NE, and this increase was dampened in the endo-EE. However, urocortin 1 was increased in the vesicles of the endo-EE group, suggesting different pathways of activation of CRH receptors in this group. Our results suggest that the use of multimodal complementary therapies that reduce stress in endometriosis could be an effective and safe treatment alternative, with minimal side effects.

AB  - Comorbidity in the affective domain seems rather typical for idiopathic epilepsy. Whether seizures are causative for the behavioral abnormalities or whether they are a common genetic cause remains to be established. Although the most proper control groups are not always available, there seems to be some consistency in the behavioral patterns seen in rats with absence epilepsy. Formal behavioral testing has shown that genetic absence models such as WAG/Rij's and GAERS, but also other rat lines endowed with spontaneous occurring spike-wave discharges (APO-SUS and Long-Evans rats), show all signs of depression-like behavior, while some lines show an even more complex affective comorbidity. The availability of a treatment that prevents both the neurodevelopment of the genetically programmed seizure and the comorbid symptomatology may help in answering whether seizures are causative for or epiphenomena of changes in affective behavior. If absence seizures and depressive-like behavior is indeed caused by the same underlying factors, then it is predicted that preventing environmental stress in absence epileptic rats will also prevent the affective disturbances.

AB  - Affective biases are hypothesised to contribute to the cause and treatment of mood disorders. We have previously found that affective biases, associated with learning and memory, are observed following acute treatments with a range of antidepressant and pro-depressant manipulations.
   This study aimed to test if similar biases are observed in male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We also test whether the stress hormone, corticosterone, induces a negative bias in the affective bias test (ABT) consistent with its putative role in the development of depression. We then use a meta-analysis to compare our findings with data published for the Lister Hooded rats.
   The ABT uses a within-subject study design where animals learn to associate distinct digging substrates, encountered on different days, with the same value food reward. Exposure to one substrate is paired with a treatment manipulation (drug or environmental) and the other with a control condition. A preference test is used to test if the treatment has induced a positive or negative bias.
   Consistent with previous data, both male and female SD rats exhibit similar positive affective biases following treatment with the antidepressant, venlafaxine, and social play and negative affective biases following FG 7142 (benzodiazepine inverse agonist) and social stress. Acute treatment with corticosterone induced a negative bias.
   These data add to the translational validity of the ABT and suggest that corticosterone can induce a negative affective bias following acute treatment, an effect which may contribute to its long-term effects on mood.

AB  - Is music just noise, and thus potentially harmful to laboratory animals, or can it have a beneficial effect? Research addressing this question has generated mixed results, perhaps because of the different types and styles of music used across various studies. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of 2 different types (vocal versus instrumental) and 2 genres (classical vocal versus 'easy-listening' vocal) of music on social behavior in 31 female and 26 male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Results indicated that instrumental music was more effective at increasing affiliative behavior in both male and female chimpanzees, whereas vocal music was more effective at decreasing agonistic behavior. A comparison of 2 genre of vocal music indicated that easy-listening (slower tempo) vocal music was more effective at decreasing agonistic behavior in male chimpanzees than classical (faster tempo) vocal music. Agonistic behavior in females remained low (< 0.5%) throughout the study and was unaffected by music. These results indicate that, like humans, captive chimpanzees react differently to various types and genres of music. The reactions varied depending on both the sex of the subject and the type of social behavior examined. Management programs should consider both type and genre when implementing a musical enrichment program for nonhuman primates.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of predisposition to perform harmful social behaviour, maternal rearing environment, and lactation environment on the responses of pigs to weaning at 3 or 5 weeks of age. Predisposed and non-predisposed gilts were selected as dams for this study at 7 weeks of age. Selection was based on behaviour in a "tail chew" test and performance of harmful social behaviour towards penmates. The gilts were mated at puberty with boars of a similar predisposition, and farrowed at approximately 44 weeks of age. Half of the gilts of each predisposition were reared from the time of selection until farrowing in barren environments, and half in enriched environments. During lactation, gilts and litters were either housed in a similar environment to that which gilts had experienced during rearing, or in a different environment (i.e. in terms of being barren or enriched). Litters from each treatment group were weaned at either 3 weeks of age (early weaning), or 5 weeks of age. After weaning, piglets were regrouped and housed in slatted pens without access to substrates. Non-predisposition to perform harmful social behaviour was associated with reduced growth during the post-weaning period (P < 0.01), and increased belly nosing behaviour in response to early weaning (P < 0.05). These effects were not mitigated by maternal experience or lactation environment factors, and it is concluded that this type of selection may not be commercially viable. Rearing dams in barren rather than enriched environments led to reduced welfare in offspring. This was reflected in increased adrenocortical reactivity during the lactation period (P < 0.01), and increased belly nosing behaviour in response to early weaning (P < 0.05). The effect of barren maternal rearing environments on belly nosing behaviour by offspring was eliminated when pigs were housed in enriched lactation environments (P < 0.01). Enrichment during the lactation period also led to improved growth rates in the post-weaning period (P < 0.01). It is suggested that this effect was due to an enhanced ability to cope with the weaning process. Overall, the results show that both genetic and early environmental factors are important determinants of the responses of pigs to weaning. Adverse effects of barren maternal rearing environments may be overcome by housing pigs in enriched lactation environments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In earlier experiments we have demonstrated that group-housing in a rather impoverished "standard" environment can be a crucial stress factor in male C57B1/6 mice. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of combining a probable genetic vulnerability - postulated by the "Neurotrophin Hypothesis of Depression" - with the potentially modulating influence of a stressful environment such as "impoverished" standard housing conditions.
   For that purpose mice with a partial deletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were group-housed under standard and enriched housing conditions and analysed in a well-established test battery for emotional behaviours.
   Standard group-housing affected emotional behaviour in male and female BDNF heterozygous mice, causing an increase in anxiety, changes in exploration as well as nociception. Providing the animals' cages with supplementary enrichment, however, led to a rescue of emotional alterations, which emphasises the significance of external factors and their relevance for a valid investigation of genetic aspects in these mutants as well as others, which may be examined in terms of stress-responsiveness or emotionality.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the effects of swimming exercise during adolescence on morphine induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and behavioral sensitization in maternally separated male and female rat pups. Male Wistar rats were allowed to mate with female virgin Wistar rats. Pups were separated from the dam daily for 180 min during postnatal days 2-14. All pups were weaned on day 21.The exercising pups were allowed to swim (60 min/d, five days per a week, for 30 days) during adolescence. Then, rat pups were tested for behavioral sensitization and the CPP induced by morphine. Maternal separation produced a significant increase in morphine-induced CPP in both sexes, behavioral sensitization in male pups and tolerance to morphine-induced motor activity in female pups. Swimmer pups separated from the dam exhibited a decrease in morphine-induced CPP in both sexes and behavioral sensitization in male pups than those of their control pups. The present results have shown that swimming exercise during adolescence may exert a protective effect against morphine-induced reward and behavioral sensitization in adult male and female rats following maternal separation.

AB  - Background Major depressive disorder is a chronic illness with a higher incidence in women. Dysregulated neural oscillatory activity is an emerging mechanism thought to underlie major depressive disorder, but whether sex differences in these rhythms contribute to the development of symptoms is unknown. Methods We exposed male and female rats to chronic unpredictable stress and characterized them as stress-resilient or stress-susceptible based on behavioural output in the forced swim test and the sucrose preference test. To identify sex-specific neural oscillatory patterns associated with stress response, we recorded local field potentials from the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens and dorsal hippocampus throughout stress exposure. Results At baseline, female stress-resilient rats innately exhibited higher theta coherence in hippocampal connections compared with stress-susceptible female rats. Following stress exposure, additional oscillatory changes manifested: stress-resilient females were characterized by increased dorsal hippocampal theta power and cortical gamma power, and stress-resilient males were characterized by a widespread increase in high gamma coherence. In stress-susceptible animals, we observed a pattern of increased delta and reduced theta power; the changes were restricted to the cingulate cortex and dorsal hippocampus in males but occurred globally in females. Finally, stress exposure was accompanied by the time-dependent recruitment of specific neural pathways, which culminated in system-wide changes that temporally coincided with the onset of depression-like behaviour. Limitations We could not establish causality between the electrophysiological changes and behaviours with the methodology we employed. Conclusion Sex-specific neurophysiological patterns can function as early markers for stress vulnerability and the onset of depression-like behaviours in rats.

AB  - Research conducted by the Anthrozoology Institute and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory has shown that many working dogs exhibit high levels of physiologic stress in response to kenneling (Hiby et al., 2006; Rooney et al., 2007a). Furthermore, these dogs tend to per-form poorly during training, establishing links between welfare and working ability (Rooney et al., 2005, 2007b). Subsequently, we have been studying how kenneling affects welfare and working ability. Specifically, we have investigated which elements within housing and husbandry influence welfare, which of these seem to be the most important, and how environmental enrichment (e.g. feeding devices) can affect welfare and working ability. This paper draws together results from all of these studies, identifying signs that may be indicative of compromised welfare, and providing guidelines, based on scientific evidence, for how to improve kenneled working dog welfare. It reproduces an unpublished guide designed to primarily inform and advise practitioners who are responsible for caring for, and/or handling working dogs. This paper aims to ensure that practitioners are updated of the most recent advances in working dog welfare, and hence many of the studies summarized here are yet to be published in full, in peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - One of the features of the Consortium on Individual Development is the existence of a rodent cohort, in parallel with the human cohorts. Here we give an overview of the current status. We first elaborate on the choice of rat and mouse models mimicking early life adverse or beneficial conditions during development. We performed systematic literature search on early life adversity and adult social behavior to address the status quo. Next, we describe the behavioral tasks we used and designed to examine behavioral control and social competence rodents. The results so far indicate that manipulation of the environment in the first postnatal week only subtly affects social behavior. Stronger effects were seen in the model that targeted early adolescence; once adult, these rats are characterized by increased attention, a higher degree of impulsiveness and reduced social interest peers. Many experiments in our rodent models with tightly controlled conditions were inspired by findings human cohorts, and now allow in-depth mechanistic investigations. Vice versa, some of the findings in rodents are currently followed up by dedicated investigations in the human cohorts. This exemplifies the added value animal investigations in a consortium encompassing primarily human developmental cohorts.

AB  - Young children who have sustained severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) can suffer from debilitating neurocognitive deficits. Impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with cognitive deficits and depression. Very few studies have investigated the adult hippocampal neurogenesis after pediatric TBI. Here, we evaluated long-term cognition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and microglial activation in a rabbit pediatric TBI model. On Post-natal Day 5-7 (P5-7), New Zealand white rabbits from the same litter were randomized into naive, sham (craniotomy alone), and TBI (controlled cortical impact). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered at 1-month post-injury, once/daily for 5 consecutive days. Novel object recognition and spontaneous alternation in T-maze tests were performed at 2 months post-injury to measure the cognitive functions. The animals were euthanized after behavioral tests at 3 months of age to evaluate adult hippocampal neurogenesis and microglial activation. We found that: 1) pediatric TBI caused significant deficits in hippocampal dependent cognitive functions; 2) the survival rates of adult-born neurons at both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus significantly decreased in the TBI group; 3) TBI induced ectopic migration of adult-born neurons at the dorsal dentate gyrus in both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus; 4) TBI increased astrogenesis in the hilus of the dentate gyrus; and 5) TBI results in abnormal microglial activation. In conclusion, pediatric TBI causes prolonged neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the adult hippocampal neurogenesis through young adulthood, which might be responsible for the cognitive deficits. Protection of adult hippocampal neurogenesis may potentially improve outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Stress is a known trigger for the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that presents with abnormal bowel habits and abdominal pain due to visceral hypersensitivity. While behavioral therapies have been used to attenuate IBS symptoms, the underlying mechanisms by which these therapies interact with stress-induced pathology remains to be delineated. Here we use a rat model to test the hypothesis that exposure to environmental enrichment (EE) inhibits stress-induced changes within the brain-gut axis to prevent visceral and somatic hypersensitivity and colonic hyperpermeability. Methods: Female rats (n = 8/group) were housed in EE one week before and one week during exposure to water avoidance stress (WAS) while controls were housed in standard cages (SH). One day after the final WAS exposure, colonic and somatic sensitivity were assessed by the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distension (CRD) and withdrawal threshold elicited by an electronic von Frey on the hind paw of the rats respectively. All rats were returned to SH for 3 weeks before colonic and somatic sensitivity were reassessed on day 28. The rats were then immediately euthanized and the spinal cord was collected to assess changes in neuronal activation (assessed via ERK phosphorylation) in response to noxious CRD. A separate cohort of animals (n = 8/group) that did not undergo behavioral assessments was euthanized the day after the final WAS exposure and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) was collected to investigate WAS and EE induced epigenetic changes at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) promoter. The colon from these rats was also collected to assess colonic permeability via changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in vitro. Results: Exposure to stress persistently increased VMR to CRD (P < 0.01) and decreased the hind paw withdrawal threshold (P < 0.001) in female rats. WAS also decreased TEER in the colon tissue of female rats (p = 0.05). In the CeA, WAS induced a decrease in histone acetylation at the GR promoter but increased histone acetylation at the CRH promoter and reduced GR-CRH interactions in the CeA. Analysis of the spinal cord showed that WAS increased CRD-evoked ERK phosphorylation in the dorsal horn. Exposure to EE prevented WAS-induced changes in the CeA, dorsal horn and colon respectively to prevent visceral and somatic hypersensitivity. Conclusion: Our data reveals that behavioral therapies can produce long lasting molecular and epigenetic changes that can prevent stress-induced pathologies even after completion of the therapy. These results highlight the potential mechanisms by which behavioral therapies may ameliorate visceral pain associated stress-related pathologies such as the irritable bowel syndrome.

AB  - Neonatal handling is an early experience which results in improved function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increased adaptability and coping as a response to stress, as well as better cognitive abilities. In the present study, we investigated the effect of neonatal handling on the basal forebrain cholinergic system, since this system is known to play an important role in cognitive processes. We report that neonatal handling results in increased number of choline-acetyl transferase immunopositive cells in the septum/diagonal band, in both sexes, while no such effect was observed in the other cholinergic nuclei, such as the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In addition, neonatal handling resulted in increased M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor binding sites in the cingulate and piriform cortex of both male and female rats. A handling-induced increase in M1 muscarinic receptor binding sites was also observed in the CA3 and CA4 (fields 3 and 4 of Ammon's horn) areas of the hippocampus. Furthermore, a handling-induced increase in acetylcholinesterase staining was found only in the hippocampus of females. Our results thus show that neonatal handling acts in a sexually dimorphic manner on one of the cholinergic parameters, and has a beneficial effect on BFCS function, which could be related to the more efficient and adaptive stress response and the superior cognitive abilities of handled animals.

AB  - Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations have been used to evaluate adrenal activity in a variety of species; including as an indicator of the physiological response to social stress. However, across studies, the relationships between dominance rank, social behaviours and adrenal responses can be inconsistent. Differences in the relationship between rank and glucocorticoids may be due to the relative costs of social status, and the relative frequencies of social stressors and potential coping mechanisms. However, the differences in observed relationships between specific social behaviours and glucocorticoids may be partly explained by sampling frequency, as studies often use average fGCM concentrations collected over a period of weeks or months, rather than fGCM concentrations that are temporally-matched with behavioural data. In this study, we directly compared long-term average and temporally-matched data to determine whether particular social behaviours were related to adrenal activity in female Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) at Trentham Monkey Forest, UK; and whether observed relationships were consistent using these two approaches. Average rates of autogrooming were positively correlated with average fGCM; however, this relationship was not robust in temporally-matched samples. Instead, specific social behaviours associated with agonism were associated with fGCM in temporally-matched samples within individuals. These results indicate that analyses of relationships using long-term average fGCM and temporally-matched samples do not necessarily provide comparable results, highlighting that study design is critical in determining associations between an individual's social behaviour and the relative physiological costs involved.

AB  - The Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) model for depression has become central to the empirical literature on depression. There are however inconsistencies in the literature concerning the robustness of the phenomenon of anhedonia following CMS procedures, We report that not only did our procedures (modeled on the original reports) fail to induce an anhedonia, but in fact led to increased sucrose consumption. Further-more, corticosterone levels following CMS procedures were lower than following control procedures. Given that this is not the first report of such findings, it is important to evaluate whether and which aspects of the experimental methodology are necessary or sufficient to induce the state of anhedonia.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluated motor function and morphological aspects of the components involved in motor control (sensorimotor cortex, spinal cord, sciatic nerve, neuromuscular junctions and skeletal muscle) in male Wistar rats exposed to a model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and the possible influence of different physical exercise protocols - treadmill and acrobatic. Male Wistar rats at the 7th post-natal day (PND) were submitted to the HIE model and from the 22nd until 60th PND the exercise protocols (treadmill or acrobatic training) were running. After the training, the animals were evaluated in Open Field, Ladder Rung Walking and Rotarod tasks and after samples of the motor control components were collected. Our results evidenced that the acrobatic training reversed the hyperactivity and anxiety, caused locomotion improvement and decreased brain atrophy in HIE animals. We did not find morphological differences on sensorimotor cortex, spinal cord, sciatic nerve, neuromuscular junctions and skeletal muscle in the animals submitted to HIE model. These intriguing data support the statement of the Rice-Vannucci model does not seem to reproduce, in structures involved in control function, the damage found in humans that suffer HIE. Regarding the protocols of exercise, we proposed that the acrobatic exercise could be a good therapeutic option especially in children affected by neonatal HIE and can be responsible for good results in cognitive and motor aspects.

AB  - Establishing new refinement strategies in laboratory animal science is a central goal in fulfilling the requirements of Directive 2010/63/EU. Previous research determined a profound impact of gentle handling protocols on the well-being of laboratory mice. By introducing clicker training to the keeping of mice, not only do we promote the amicable treatment of mice, but we also enable them to experience cognitive enrichment. Clicker training is a form of positive reinforcement training using a conditioned secondary reinforcer, the "click" sound of a clicker, which serves as a time bridge between the strengthened behavior and an upcoming reward. The effective implementation of the clicker training protocol with a cohort of 12 BALB/c inbred mice of each sex proved to be uncomplicated. The mice learned rather quickly when challenged with tasks of the clicker training protocol, and almost all trained mice overcame the challenges they were given (100% of female mice and 83% of male mice). This study has identified that clicker training for mice strongly correlates with reduced fear in the mice during human-mice interactions, as shown by reduced anxiety-related behaviors (e.g., defecation, vocalization, and urination) and fewer depression-like behaviors (e.g., floating). By developing a reliable protocol that can be easily integrated into the daily routine of the keeping of laboratory mice, the lifetime experience of welfare in the mice can be improved substantially.

AB  - Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are the closest animal models to humans regarding genetics, physiology and behavior. Therefore, NHPs are usually a critical component in translational research projects aimed at developing therapeutics, vaccines, devices or other interventions aimed at preventing, curing or ameliorating human disease. NHPs are often used in conjunction with other animal models, such as rodents, and results obtained using NHPs must often be used as the final criterion for establishing the potential efficacy of a pharmaceutical or vaccine before transition to human clinical trails. In some cases, NHPs may be the only relevant animal models for a particlular translational study. This issue of the ILAR journal brings together, in one place, articles that discuss the use of NHP models for studying human diseases that are highly prevalent and that cause extraordinary human suffering and financial and social burdens. Topics covered in detail include: tuberculosis; viral hepatitis; HIV/AIDS; neurodegenerative disorders; Substance abuse disorders; vision and prevention of blindness; disorder associated with psychosocial processes, such as anxiety, depression and loneliness; cardiovascular disease; metabolic disease, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; respiratory disease; and female reproduction, prenatal development and women's health. Proper husbandry of NHPs that reduces stress and maintains animal health is critical for the development of NHP models. This issue of the journal includes a review of procedures for environmental enrichment, which helps assure animal health and wellbeing. Taken together, these articles provide detailed reviews of the use of NHP models for translational investigations and discuss successes, limitations, challenges and opportunities associated with this research.

AB  - Domestic cats are exposed to a variety of stressful stimuli, which may have a negative effect on the cats' welfare and trigger a number of behavioural changes. Some of the stressors most commonly encountered by cats include changes in environment, inter-cat conflict, a poor human-cat relationship and the cat's inability to perform highly motivated behaviour patterns. Stress is very likely to reduce feed intake, and stress-related anorexia may contribute to the development of potentially serious medical conditions. Stress also increases the risk of cats showing urine marking and some forms of aggression, including redirected aggression. A number of compulsive disorders such as over-grooming may also develop as a consequence of stressful environments. Some of the main strategies to prevent or reduce stress-related behavioural problems in cats are environmental enrichment, appropriate management techniques to introduce unfamiliar cats to each other and the use of the synthetic analogue of the feline facial pheromone. As the stress response in cats depends, to a large extent, on the temperament of the animal, breeding and husbandry strategies that contribute to the cat developing a well-balanced temperament are also very useful.

AB  - Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11 beta-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus.

AB  - Studies have shown that animals prenatally exposed to ethanol (E) exhibit deficits in conditioned taste aversion as well as displaying hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hyperresponsiveness during exposure to stressors. In contrast, postnatal handling has been shown to attenuate both emotional and HPA reactivity under certain conditions. The present study tested the hypothesis that handling could attenuate adverse effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on consummatory behavior and HPA activity in a conditioned taste aversion task. We found that both prenatal ethanol exposure and handling independently increased saccharin consumption over 5 days of pretoxicosis exposure, suggesting that neophobia decreased at a faster rate in these animals. When conditioned aversion was assessed in handled animals under nondeprived conditions, E animals showed increased consumption compared to controls. Furthermore, across prenatal groups, lower corticosterone (CORT) levels were found in handled compared to nonhandled animals during reexposure under food-deprived conditions, emphasizing the importance of assessing both behavior and HPA function when examining an animal's response to a task and indicating that handling may not be effective at attenuating some deficits in E animals.

AB  - Working with mice represents a smart method to study pathophysiological mechanisms in vivo. However, using animals as model organisms also bears immense caveats. While many aspects in animal research are meanwhile standardized (e.g. nutrition, housing, health) the breeding environment remains unaddressed.
   Moreover, since the "production" of mice is mostly performed pragmatically, continuous mating (CM) represents a common method to boost the amount of offspring. This condition implies simultaneous pregnancy and lactation in presence of the male, which is associated with increased costs for the breeding dam.
   Facing the widely-accepted impact of perinatal conditions, our aim was to elucidate how CM affects emotional behaviour of mouse offspring. We therefore compared pregnant mice in CM with mice raising their pups without potentially disturbing influences. According to our hypothesis CM-deriving offspring should demonstrate increased anxiety and depression-like behaviour shaped by pre- and postnatal stress of the mother.
   Maternal care, i.e. nest building and pup retrieval, was analysed around delivery. To assess the emotional state of the offspring, males and females of either condition were exposed to a behavioural test battery for exploration, anxiety and fear, social and despair behaviour. In addition we analysed corticosterone as stressphysiological correlate.
   Our study demonstrates that CM affects the emotional phenotype regarding nearly all parameters addressed. These findings emphasize (i) the impact of the perinatal environment on stress-associated behaviour such as depression, and (ii) the need to imply perinatal conditions in the experimental design to decrease the risk of artefacts and increase the overall validity of animal studies.

AB  - Most studies of the effects of housing and husbandry on animals' affective states and welfare investigate the impact of stable living conditions, comparing for example, animals living in enriched environments with those living in non-enriched ones. Changes in living conditions, including from more to less enriched environments, have also been found to have effects on measures of affective state and welfare in some species. But these studies have not investigated whether it is the trajectory of change that has affected the animals (e.g., worsening con-ditions), or simply the nature of their final environment (e.g., non-enriched). Here, we hypothesised that laying hens living in worsening conditions across a six-week period (gradually moving from preferred to non-preferred living conditions; "Trajectory to Non-Preferred", TNP, n = 30), would show evidence of more negative affective states and poorer welfare than those living continuously in non-preferred conditions for the same duration ("Stable Non-Preferred", SNP, n = 30). We also hypothesised that hens living in improving conditions (gradually moving from non-preferred to preferred living conditions; "Trajectory to Preferred", TP, n = 30), would show evidence of more positive affective states and better welfare than those living continuously in preferred condi-tions ("Stable Preferred", SP, n = 30). The preferred living condition provided extensive resources and inter-mittent rewarding events (such as the delivery of food treats) known to be valued and preferred by most hens, while the non-preferred living condition provided just basic resources and intermittent aversive events (e.g., loud noises). The hens' affective states and welfare were measured using home-pen behavioural observations, body condition assessments, physiological stress measures (e.g., blood corticosterone, glucose, etc.), physical challenge tests, and judgement bias tests. A number of differences between hens in the trajectory and stable living con-ditions were found: TP hens were lighter, showed more foraging behaviour and less standing alert and head -shaking than SP hens, while TNP hens showed more head-shaking, mild feather pecking and aggressive attacking of pen mates than SNP hens. However, some of these differences failed to reach significance following Benjamini adjustments for multiple testing. The groups also did not differ in their judgement biases (measured in a sub-sample of 12 hens per experimental group), response to physical challenges, or measures of physiological stress. We conclude that the hens in the present study showed some evidence of responsiveness to 'affective trajectories' in their living conditions, but no definitive effects on their affective states and welfare.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a variety of impairments in cognition, mood, sensation, and movement, depending upon the location and severity of injury. Although not as extensively studied as cognitive impairments, motor impairments are common, especially in moderately to severely injured patients. The recovery of these deficits is not usually complete; however, extensive effort is put into the rehabilitation of motor skills to enhance independence and quality of life. Understanding the motor recovery process and how it can be influenced by rehabilitation has been extensively studied in animal models of stroke and focal lesions, albeit to a lesser extent following animal models of TBI. Injury-induced neural plasticity is intricately involved in motor recovery and influenced by behavioral compensation and rehabilitation following stroke and focal lesions. New studies in animal models of TBI indicate that neural plasticity and the processes of motor recovery and rehabilitation following brain injury may not mirror those processes shown to occur following stroke. Further examination of motor recovery, rehabilitation, and plasticity in animal models of TBI as well as in individuals with TBI will be necessary to fully understand the control of movement following brain injury.

AB  - The use of millions of mice in scientific studies worldwide emphasises the continuing need for a reduction of sample sizes, however, not at the expense of scientific validity. Split-plot designs have been suggested to enhance statistical power while allowing a reduction of animal numbers in comparison to traditional experimental designs. Recently, a promising approach of a split-plot design has been implemented and proven useful using mixed-strain housing of at least three different mouse strains. However, the impact of co-housing different strains of mice in one cage on animal welfare has still to be defined. This study aimed at comparing the effects of mixed-strain and same-strain housing of female C57BL/6J and DBA/2N mice on welfare and behaviour in two experimental phases. In a first phase, mice were housed in either mixed- or same-strain pairs. Home cage behaviour, activity rhythm, body weight, and faecal corticosterone metabolites were assessed. Furthermore, tests for anxiety-like and exploratory behaviour as well as spatial learning were performed. In a second phase, sociability was investigated in newly formed mixed-strain quartets. Mixed-strain housing did not induce alterations in anxiety, locomotion, learning, stereotypic behaviour, and stress hormone levels. However, changes in social behaviours and activity rhythm were observed. Increased agonistic and decreased socio-positive behaviours might point towards mild impacts on welfare in C57BL/6J mice under co-housing conditions. Altogether, scientific research may greatly benefit from co-housing mice of different strains within the same cages (e.g. for the realisation of a split-plot design), provided that strains are carefully selected for compatibility.

AB  - It is now widely accepted that good welfare is not simply the absence of negative experiences, but rather is primarily the presence of positive experiences such as pleasure. However scientific investigation of positive emotions has long been neglected. This paper addresses two main issues: first, it reviews the current state of scientific knowledge that supports the existence of positive affective states in animals and, second, it suggests possible applications of this knowledge that may enhance quality of life under animal management conditions. In the first part of the paper, recent advances in psychology and neuroscience are reviewed to provide pragmatic frameworks based on cognitive processes (such as positive anticipation, contrast and controllability) for further investigations of positive emotions in animals. Thereafter, the neurobiological bases of positive emotions are highlighted in order to identify behavioral and physiological expressions of positive experiences in animals. Monitoring both the autonomic nervous system (via heart rate and its variability) and the immune system could offer relevant tools to better assess emotional states in animals, complementary to classical adrenocortical measures. In the second part of the paper, useful strategies for enhancing positive experiences (such as physical, social and cognitive enrichment or putative genetic selection) are outlined. Then this paper emphasizes practical applications for assessing and promoting positive emotions that may help in providing animals with a better quality of life. Play, affiliative behaviors and some vocalizations appear to be the most promising convenient indicators for assessing positive experiences in laboratory and farm animals under commercial conditions.

AB  - Although it is widely accepted that postweaning housing conditions may affect the behaviour of animals and their responses to drugs, it remains unclear whether analogous effects exist for postpubertal housing conditions. The present study examines the effects of postpubertal housing conditions on cocaine-induced rewarding properties, behavioural sensitization and social behaviour in socially monogamous female mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus). We found that both group-housed and postpuberty isolated females developed conditioned place preferences for cocaine. Isolated females had lower levels of locomotion and sociability as well as higher levels of anxiety and aggressive behaviour compared with group-housed females. In group-housed females, repeated cocaine treatment increased locomotion and reduced social investigation, attack and body-contact behaviour, but enhanced self-grooming. However, for isolated females, this same treatment had no effect on these behaviours. Taken together, these findings indicate that postpubertal housing conditions can affect anxiety-like and social behaviours as well as cocaine-induced behavioural responsiveness in mandarin voles. Group-housed mandarin voles are more sensitive to the effects of cocaine than single-housed voles. The possible mechanisms underlying the effects of different housing on responses to cocaine are discussed.

AB  - Adolescence is a sensitive period of neurodevelopment during which life experiences can have profound effects on the brain. Hippocampal neurogenesis, the neurodevelopmental process of generating functional new neurons from neural stem cells, occurs throughout the lifespan and has been shown to play a role in learning, memory and in mood regulation. In adulthood it is influenced by extrinsic environmental factors such as exercise and stress. Intrinsic factors that regulate hippocampal neurogenesis include the orphan nuclear receptor TLX (Nr2e1) which is primarily expressed in the neurogenic niches of the brain. While mechanisms regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been widely studied, less is known on how hippocampal neurogenesis is affected during adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of both TLX and isolation stress on exercise-induced increases in neurogenesis in running and sedentary conditions during adolescence. Single- (isolation stress) wild type and Nr2e1(-/-) mice or pair-housed wild type mice were housed in sedentary conditions or allowed free access to running wheels for 3 weeks during adolescence. A reduction of neuronal survival was evident in mice lacking TLX, and exercise did not increase hippocampal neurogenesis in these Nr2e1(-/-) mice. This suggests that TLX is necessary for the pro-neurogenic effects of exercise during adolescence. Interestingly, although social isolation during adolescence did not affect hippocampal neurogenesis, it prevented an exercise-induced increase in neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus. Together these data demonstrate the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in promoting an exercise-induced increase in neurogenesis at this key point in life.

AB  - There is a growing appreciation that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in emotional and cognitive processes related to psychiatric disorders. Although many studies have investigated the effects of stress on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, most have not focused on whether stress-induced changes in neurogenesis occur specifically in animals that are more resilient or more susceptible to the behavioural and neuroendocrine effects of stress. Thus, in the present review we explore whether there is a clear relationship between stress-induced changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, stress resilience and antidepressant-induced recovery from stress-induced changes in behaviour. Exposure to different stressors is known to reduce adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but some stressors have also been shown to exert opposite effects. Ablation of neurogenesis does not lead to a depressive phenotype, but it can enhance responsiveness to stress and affect stress susceptibility. Monoaminergic-targeted antidepressants, environmental enrichment and adrenalectomy are beneficial for reversing stress-induced changes in behaviour and have been shown to do so in a neurogenesis-dependant manner. In addition, stress and antidepressants can affect hippocampal neurogenesis, preferentially in the ventral hippocampus. Together, these data show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may play a role in the neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress, although it is not yet fully clear under which circumstances neurogenesis promotes resilience or susceptibility to stress. It will be important that future studies carefully examine how adult hippocampal neurogenesis can contribute to stress resilience/susceptibility so that it may be appropriately exploited for the development of new and more effective treatments for stress-related psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Research into the effects of psychological factors on wound healing represents an ideal research model for psychoneuroimmunology, as both the impact on clinically relevant health outcomes and the underlying biological mechanisms can be examined. Mounting interest in this topic from biological scientists, psychologists, and medical specialists has resulted in new findings that are discussed in this review.
   Recent findings
   Known psychological influences on wound healing include stress as well as coping styles, positive affect, environmental enrichment, and social support. Research has highlighted the roles of oxytocin, vasopressin, epinephrine, cortisol, and leukocyte redistribution in wound healing. Clinical significance has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies in patient populations. Furthermore, pragmatic interventions with clinical samples have demonstrated clear benefits of psychological interventions on wound healing.
   Summary
   Recent studies add to growing evidence that psychology impacts wound repair, and highlight in particular the positive role of social support on modulating the negative effects of stress. The first few studies to demonstrate that psychological interventions can improve healing in clinical populations are exciting developments. New knowledge of psychobiological mechanisms provides opportunities to develop further interventions to improve health outcomes.

AB  - Paternal environmental experiences are significant predictors of developmental outcomes in offspring and can occur even in the absence of paternal care. Although there has been a recent focus on the role of environmentally induced changes in the male germline in producing these effects, the potential mediating role of mothers has not been investigated. A role for mothers in the transmission of paternal effects has been well acknowledged in behavioral ecology, which predicts that females will dynamically adjust their reproductive investment in response to the qualities of their mate. In the present study, we show that a lifetime of socially enriched compared with impoverished housing conditions shifts anxiety-like behavior and gene expression of male mice. Females that mate with enriched-reared males exhibit increased levels of pup nursing and licking toward their offspring, which are associated with changes in gene expression within the maternal hypothalamus. Significantly, these changes in maternal behavior are correlated with the general levels of anxiety exhibited by their male mates. Further, we show that paternal environmental enrichment results in increased growth of their offspring. These results suggest that maternal-paternal interactions at mating may guide offspring development, with significant implications for the transgenerational transmission of paternal environmental experiences.

AB  - Cognitive mechanisms are an important part of the organization of the behavior systems of animals. In the wild, animals regularly face problems that they must overcome in order to survive and thrive. Solving such problems often requires animals to process, store, retrieve, and act upon information from the environment-in other words, to use their cognitive skills. For example, animals may have to use navigational, tool-making or cooperative social skills in order to procure their food. However, many enrichment programs for captive animals do not include the integration of these types of cognitive challenges. Thus, foraging enrichments typically are designed to facilitate the physical expression of feeding behaviors such as food-searching and food consumption, but not to facilitate complex problem solving behaviors related to food acquisition. Challenging animals by presenting them with problems is almost certainly a source of frustration and stress. However, we suggest here that this is an important, and even necessary, feature of an enrichment program, as long as animals also possess the skills and resources to effectively solve the problems with which they are presented. We discuss this with reference to theories about the emotional consequences of coping with challenge, the association between lack of challenge and the development of abnormal behavior, and the benefits of stress (arousal) in facilitating learning and memory of relevant skills. Much remains to be done to provide empirical support for these theories. However, they do point the way to a practical approach to improving animal welfare-to design enrichments to facilitate the cognitive mechanisms which underlie the performance of complex behaviors that cannot be performed due to the restrictions inherent to the captive environment.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical developmental period during which chronic stress and binge alcohol consumption are often seen as environmental risk factors that confer vulnerability to later mental health problems. The current study modelled this using a 2 x 2 design where male Wistar rats were exposed to intermittent predatory stress (Stress condition: groups of 4 rats given 30 min of cat fur exposure in a large arena, once every 48 h) or intermittent alcohol (Alcohol condition: access to beer for 24 h every 2nd day), or both manipulations given on alternate days (Stress/Alcohol), or no manipulation (Control). The manipulations occurred over a 24 day adolescent window (postnatal day (PND) 33-57) giving a total of 12 cat fur exposures and/or 12 alternate days of beer access. Residual anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours were assessed in early adulthood (PND 58-77). Cat fur exposure was found to elicit a distinct defensive response in which groups of adolescent rats huddled together in the corner of the arena, either in "quads" (all 4 rats bunched together) or "triplets" (3 rats together and one outlier rat). Few approaches to the cat fur occurred and locomotor activity was suppressed relative to Control rats placed in the arena without fur. Huddling continued over the 12 repeated exposures to cat fur, and was temporarily exaggerated when fur from a novel cat was introduced. Interestingly, huddling and conditioned fear in the fur-associated context were most pronounced in rats receiving intermittent alcohol, suggesting that alternate day exposure to alcohol had anxiogenic effects, possibly linked to a hangover state on these days. Predatory stress did not affect overall alcohol consumption relative to rats given alcohol alone, but significantly inhibited weight gain through adolescence and into adulthood. In early adulthood, rats exposed to stress in adolescence, regardless of alcohol exposure, showed significantly reduced immobility in the forced swim test and signs of increased sociability with a novel conspecific in a social interaction paradigm. Overall, these findings suggest greater resilience in adulthood after chronic adolescent stress, indicating that coping with predators may be in some ways a form of early environmental enrichment.

AB  - This study addressed the impact of early and later life environmental enrichment, and their combination, on specific antibody responses and peripheral blood leukocyte subpopulations in pigs. Pigs were kept in either barren (B1) or enriched (E1) housing from birth, and half of the pigs switched to barren or enriched housing on day 47, resulting in four treatment combinations: B1B2, B1E2, E1B2, E1E2). Pigs were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated trinitrophenyl (KLH-TNP) on day 74 and 109 to induce primary and secondary antibody responses. Blood samples were taken weekly until day 130, and IgM and IgG antibody responses were measured. Leukocyte subpopulations were measured on day 74 and 130. Time course of the antibody responses was not affected by housing. Early life enrichment increased the IgG response to KLH, particularly the primary one. At day 74 the relative frequency of lymphocytes, DC and SLA-II expression on monocytes were higher in E1 pigs, whereas the percentage of granulocytes tended to be lower in E1 pigs at day 74. Early life enrichment increased the SLA-II expression on monocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio, and tended to increase the percentage of granulocytes, but tended to decrease the percentage of monocytes at day 130. Later life enrichment reduced percentages of CD4 + CD8 alpha(+) T cells before and after immunization and the SLA-II expression on monocytes at day 74, the percentage of granulocytes and the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio at day 130. Notably, early and later life housing interacted in their effects on several immune parameters. KLH-IgM responses (both primary and secondary) were affected by the interaction between early and later life housing. IgM titers were higher for Bl B2 than for E1E2, with the switched animals (B1E2 and El B2) moving towards the titers of the animals kept in their later life environment from birth onwards. At day 130 the percentage of gamma delta T cells, CD8 alpha(+) cytotoxic T cells and DC were not different between pigs kept in B1B2 and E1E2, but there was a clear impact of the switch in housing conditions, particularly for the pigs that changed from barren to enriched housing. We also found effects of coping style (personality) and sex on some immune parameters. In conclusion, both early life and later life enrichment, and, notably a switch in housing conditions influenced specific antibodies and leukocyte subpopulations in pigs. The current study implies that the early life history of animals and the (mis)match with their current environment could thus be of major importance for their immune system. Further research is needed to investigate potential consequences for the pigs' health.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the mechanism of shaking as a prenatal stressor impacting the development of the offspring and Chinese medicines correcting the alterations. Pregnant rats were randomized into earthquake simulation group (ESG), herbal group (HG) which received herbal supplements in feed after shaking, and control group (CG). Findings revealed body weight and open field test (OFT) score of ESG offspring were statistically inferior to the CG and HG offspring. The corticosterone levels of ESG were higher than those of CG but not than HG. The dopamine level of ESG was slightly lower than that of the CG and of HG was higher than that of ESG. The 5-HT of ESG was higher than CG and HG. The growth hormone level of the ESG was significantly lower than ESG but not than CG. Gene expression profile showed 81 genes upregulated and 39 genes downregulated in ESG versus CG, and 60 genes upregulated and 28 genes downregulated in ESG versus HG. Eighty-four genes were found differentially expressed in ESG versus CG comparison and were normalized in ESG versus HG. We conclude that maternal shaking negatively affected physical and nervous system development, with specific alterations in neurohormones and gene expression. Chinese herbal medicine reduced these negative outcomes.

AB  - Handling is a well-known source of stress to laboratory animals and can affect variability of results and even compromise animal welfare. The conventional tail handling in mice has been shown to induce aversion and anxiety-like behaviour. Recent findings demonstrate that the use of alternative handling techniques, e.g. tunnel handling, can mitigate negative handling-induced effects. Here, we show that technique and frequency of handling influence affective behaviour and stress hormone release of subjects in a sex-dependent manner. While frequent tail handling led to a reduction of wellbeing-associated burrowing and increased despair-like behaviour in male mice, females seemed unaffected. Instead, they displayed a stress response to a low handling frequency, which was not detectable in males. This could suggest that in terms of refinement, the impact in handling could differ between the sexes. Independently from this observation, both sexes preferred to interact with the tunnel. Mice generally explored the tunnel more often than the tail-handling hands of the experimenter and showed more positively rated approaches, e.g. touching or climbing, and at the same time, less defensive burrowing, indicating a strong preference for the tunnel.

AB  - Although Sprague Dawley outbred rats are commonly used in behavioral, physiological, and pharmacological studies, dramatic differences in responses may emerge from rats obtained from different suppliers even when sex, age, and environmental conditions are maintained constant. In the present study, we compared behavioral responses on three tests related to anxiety of Sprague Dawley female and male rats obtained from three different vendors in the United States: Charles River, Envigo, and Taconic. All rats were tested in the open field, light-dark box, and elevated zero maze. We found reduced time spent in the center area of the open field and decreased light compartment duration in the light-dark box test in female and male rats from Taconic compared to Charles River and Envigo rats, suggesting anxiety-like behaviors differ between the three vendors. No vendor differences were found on performance in the elevated zero maze. Furthermore, the contribution of stress hormones to vendor differences was examined by measuring serum corticosterone levels in rats 30 min after exposure to the elevated zero maze. There were no vendor differences in corticosterone levels, suggesting that endogenous levels of stress hormones most likely did not contribute to vendor differences in anxiety-like behaviors. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of vendor selection of the Sprague Dawley stock for research involving behavioral tests related to anxiety.

AB  - Coping with intermittent social stress is an essential aspect of living in complex social environments. Coping tends to counteract the deleterious effects of stress and is thought to induce neuroadaptations in corticolimbic brain systems. Here we test this hypothesis in adult squirrel monkey males exposed to intermittent social separations and new pair formations. These manipulations simulate conditions that typically occur in male social associations because of competition for limited access to residency in mixed-sex groups. As evidence of coping, we previously confirmed that cortisol levels initially increase and then are restored to prestress levels within several days of each separation and new pair formation. Follow-up studies with exogenous cortisol further established that feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is not impaired. Now we report that exposure to intermittent social separations and new pair formations increased hippocampal neurogenesis in squirrel monkey males. Hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents contributes to spatial learning performance, and in monkeys we found that spatial learning was enhanced in conditions that increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Corresponding changes were discerned in the expression of genes involved in survival and integration of adult-born granule cells into hippocampal neural circuits. These findings support recent indications that stress coping stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rodents. Psychotherapies designed to promote stress coping potentially have similar effects in humans with major depression.

AB  - In humans and numerous other mammalian species, individuals considerably vary in their level of trait anxiety. This well known phenomenon is closely related to the etiology of several psychiatric disorders, but its neurophysiological basis remains poorly understood. Here, we applied voltage-sensitive dye imaging to brain slices from animals of the high (HAB), normal (NAB), and low (LAB) trait anxiety mouse model and investigated whether evoked neuronal activity propagations from the lateral (LA) to the central (CeA) amygdala differ in their relative strength among HAB, NAB, and LAB mice. For this purpose, we divided a real-time measure of neuronal population activity in the CeA by a respective measure obtained for the LA. This calculation yielded the metric "CeA/LA activity." Our data clearly demonstrate a positive correlation between trait anxiety levels evaluated by the elevated plus-maze test and CeA/LA activity. Moreover, we found reduced CeA/LA activity in HAB mice, which responded with decreased anxiety levels to an environmental enrichment and, inversely, detected increased anxiety levels and CeA/LA activity in LAB mice that experienced chronic mild stress. We did not observe differences in the spread of neuronal activity in the motor and visual cortex among HAB, NAB, and LAB animals. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that, in mammals, interindividual variability in trait anxiety is causally linked to individual variations in the physiological constitution of the LA-to-CeA circuitry that give rise to a differential regulation of neuronal signal flow through this fundamental input-output network of the amygdala.

AB  - In humans, the short allele of a common polymorphism in the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene is associated with a higher risk to develop depression and anxiety disorders. Furthermore, individuals carrying this allele are characterized by negative judgment biases, as they tend to interpret ambiguous information in a more pessimistic way. 5-HTT knockout mice, lacking the 5-HTT gene either homo- or heterozygously, provide a widely used model organism for the study of symptoms related to human anxiety disorders. In the present study, we aimed to prove the anxiety-like phenotype of the 5-HTT mouse model, and to investigate whether 5-HTT genotype also causes differences in judgment bias. While our results confirm that homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice display highest levels of anxiety-like behavior, it was decreased in heterozygous mice. Against our expectations, we did not detect differences in the animals' judgment bias. These results indicate that at least in mice the association between 5-HTT genotype and judgment bias is not straightforward and that other factors, including multiple genes as well as environmental influences, are implicated in the modulation of judgment biases. More research is needed to gain further insights into their function as potential endophenotypes for psychopathology.

AB  - The hippocampus is particularly involved in cognitive processes and is a key regulator of stress responses and emotions. Therefore, the role of adult-born neurons in this region has become a crucial field of research in order to understand mood and stress disorders, such as major depression. Many studies have characterized the role of these neurons in cognition, mood regulation and antidepressant actions. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underpinning their antidepressant effects remain unclear. In this review, we first discuss the effects of stress and antidepressant treatments on adult neurogenesis, and subsequently, the functional roles of adult-born neurons and the mechanisms underlying their antidepressant action. Some studies have shown that adult-born neurons could affect overall hippocampal activity and thus normalize it under depression, which could restore neuronal pathways underlying antidepressant effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal shelters need to do their best to ensure that the cats in their care have a good quality of life. There are many strategies they can use to meet this goal. However, it is important to evaluate if these strategies are successful to ensure continual improvement of care. This evaluation can be challenging, as tools for this purpose are limited. This paper presents a method of evaluating four different expressions of cat welfare on a 0-5 scale and shows that results are very similar between raters (after a training program), ensuring that the data are reliable. These rating scales may prove useful for other shelters or any environment where objective evaluation of cat welfare is required. Safeguarding the well-being of cats is essential to the mission of any responsible animal shelter. Environmental enrichment and behaviour modification are often key to this goal. Measuring response to these interventions is essential to ensure strategies are successful. There are often many staff and volunteers involved in these efforts, and a lack of standardised language can make monitoring progress difficult. Ordinal rating scales of key behaviours can be a useful way to summarise observations and ensure that common language is used. However, it is crucial that these scales have good interobserver agreement and reliability, so operational definitions and training systems are important. This paper presents a method for evaluating four different expressions of cat welfare on a 0-5 scale: modified Fear, Anxiety, and Stress score; Response to Petting score; Participation in Play score; and Food Intake Summary score. All scales showed almost perfect average interobserver agreement (linear weighted kappa) and excellent average interobserver reliability (interclass correlation coefficient). These scales may prove useful to other shelters, or any other environment where evaluating response to interventions is important to the welfare of cats, such as research facilities or home environments. The exceptional interobserver agreement and reliability of this study compared with some others highlights the importance of standardised training programs.

AB  - This work aims to verify the role of noise and music as anxiety modulators and their relationship with ovarian hormones. For this purpose, female Wistar rats were used and treated, forming different experimental groups, with 17-beta-estradiol, progesterone, allopregnanolone, finasteride (inhibitor of the 5-alpha-reductase) and faslodex (inhibitor of estrogen receptors), with the rats being previously ovariectomized in the case of the first three hormones. All the groups were submitted to stimuli of silence, white noise (sound that has all frequencies) and music (sonata for 2 pianos K. 448 by W.A. Mozart), and to two valuation tests of the anxiety levels: elevated plus-maze and light-dark box transition. In this study, the anxiogenic effect of noise and the anxiolytic effect of music were verified. Both exerted their effects separately from the ovarian steroid hormones, although the influence of progesterone and allopregnanolone increased the anxiolytic power of the music. 17-beta-estradiol was the least influential of the ovarian hormones and its effects might be concealed by the intervention of the other two (allopregnanolone and progesterone).

AB  - Behavioural syndrome studies are commonly descriptive and often find a relationship between boldness, shyness and exploration. However, the mechanisms underlying behavioural syndromes are not well understood. In the present study, we examined the extent to which early experience acts as a modifier of behavioural tendencies in the basal tarantula, Brachypelma smithi. Juvenile individuals were housed for 2 years either in enriched controlled conditions, or in restricted (minimal) conditions. Behavioural assays were completed both in short-term and in long-term increments. We found both short-term and longterm differences in multiple contexts of behaviour between treatments. In addition, individuals in the enriched treatment developed correlations between several behavioural traits whereas individuals in the restricted treatment did not. This result suggests that early environment can induce behavioural syndromes in some populations, or conversely, that continual stress may break down normal behavioural development and thus prevent a behavioural syndrome from emerging. This study provides a cautionary tale for those studying behavioural syndromes in captivity, and because this is a basal spider species, it provides important insight into the evolution of spider behavioural syndromes.

AB  - New neuron formation in the adult brain was an interesting finding that extended the knowledge about brain plasticity. In 1966 Joseph Altman reported the incorporation of tritiated thymidine to neural cell DNA. This finding indicated the proliferation event in the adult brain. After twenty years of this finding, new information was generated that confirmed the new neuron formation in the adulthood.
   In this review, we will mention different aspects of the new neuron formation process called neurogenesis, as well as some of the factors that modulate such process, citing the information already known about the neuronal development stages that take place for the new neuron formation in the hippocampus. Finally, we will review some evidence about the neurogenic process in depression and in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the possible role of the new neurons when they are integrated into the neuronal network.
   In the adult brain there are two regions where new neuron formation process takes place: the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus. New neurons ate derived from neural stem cells, which reside in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Neural stem cells may proliferate and generate the rapid amplifying progenitor and neuroblast populations. These populations will migrate and differentiate in neurons to finally be integrated into the neuronal network.
   In the adult brain, neural stem cells have radial glial features expressing specific markers as the glial fibrilar acidic protein (GFAP), as well as the un-differentiated cell marker nestin. This characteristic makes suitable neural stem cells identification. Thus, the new neurons can be identified by both the specific marker expression and by electrophysiological properties. The different cell development stages during the neurogenic process have been characterized in the subventricular zone as well as in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In addition to the radial-glia features, neural stem cells show a slowly dividing ratio and once the neural stem cells divide by asymmetric division a rapid amplifying progenitor population is generated. In the hippocampus, phenotype analysis had allowed cell classification in three different types according to the kind of protein marker expression. These progenitors are generated during the expansion phase by symmetric cell division. Type 2a and 2b present short neuritic processes parallel to the granular cell layer and the Type 3 present longer processes integrated into the granular cell layer. During this step, where the migration and cell fate decision take place, the cells express different markers as the microtubule associated protein doublecortin, the homeobox gene related to the Drosophila gene prospero, Prox-1 and the neuron-specific nuclear protein Neu-N. Once the cells exit the cell cycle, immature neurons are generated showing longer dendritic processes crossing the granular cell layer. These immature neurons will fully differentiate to be integrated into the neuronal network. At this final stage the cells are full), differentiated and the new neurons express specific markers as the calcium binding protein calbindin and their electrophysiological properties are similar to the old neurons.
   Neurogenesis is a complex process that is modulated and regulated by different factors. One of these is the niche which is formed by the neural stem cells, astrocytes and endothelial cells. Adult neural stem cells proliferate and differentiate depending on the cellular and molecular composition of the niche. The three components work in synchrony in both neurogenic areas with active proliferation. The role of the niche is the maintenance of the stem cells pool. The astrocytes modulate the proliferation of the neural stem cell and of the rapid amplifying cell population, as well as the migration of these cells by the action of the secreting factors. The niche also plays a key role in maintaining the astrocytic and the endothelial cell populations.
   Besides the niche, other factors are involved in the neurogenic process, such as the neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine), hormones (prolactin, growth hormone), growth factors (FGF, EGF) and neurotrophins (BDNF, NT3). All of them modulate different steps of the process. Some other factors that influence the new neuron formation include the physical activity, enrichment environment and social interaction. It has been shown that physical activity increases the number of surviving newborn cells when rodents have free access to the running wheel. Another positive regulator of the neurogenic process is the enrichment environment. The influence of this factor on the new neuron formation was demonstrated when the animals were maintained in a cage with tunnels and toys. In addition, when the rodents were forced to learn a particular task, more new neurons were found in the dentate gyrus. Additionally, the social interaction has a positive influence on the new neuron formation.
   Even when neurogenesis is positively regulated by the afore mentioned factors, different conditions and factors have a negative influence on this process. It is known that psychological stress affects in a negative manner the neurogenic process. The stress decreases the proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus. This negative effect involves glucocorticoids whose increased levels inhibit the new neuron formation. Also, an exogenous administered corticosterone suppresses the new neuron formation. Another negative factor on neurogenesis related to glucocorticoids, is the sleep deprivation, which impairs the neurogenic process by increasing corticosterone levels causing a reduction in cell proliferation. Also, the abuse drugs cause a negative effect in the new neuron formation. It is known that chronic alcoholism negatively impact neurogenesis as well as cocaine, drug that impairs the proliferation dynamics in the dentate gyrus.
   Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, have been associated with an impaired neurogenesis, which is reverted by antidepressant drugs. In contrast to the effects of stress, an antidepressant pharmacologic treatment increases the new neuron formation. The antidepressant effect is dependent on chronic treatment, consistent with the time course of the therapeutic action of these compounds. Recently, it has been shown that fluoxetine increases symmetric divisions of early progenitor cells and that these cells called or named neuronal progenitors targeted by fluoxetine in the adult brain.
   This report describes one mechanism for antidepressant; however, the mechanisms by which antidepressant drugs act is not known at all and can be complex. Nevertheless, it has been reported that antidepressants induce an increase in serotonin or norephinephrine levels which activate the corresponding receptors and their downstream signaling pathways. One of these signaling pathways is the cAMP-CREB cascade. This second messenger is upregulated in the hippocampus together with the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. On the same pathway, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) shows an increase in function and expression.
   In patients with neurodegeneration, a defect in the neurogenesis process has been described. In Alzheimer's disease, cell proliferation and the potential regenerative factors levels are diminished. However, several studies have revealed an increase in the expression of the neurogenic marker doublecortin. Recently, it has been reported the presence of proliferative cells in presenile Alzheimer hippocampus without indications for altered dentate gyrus. In addition to this finding, the influence of the enrichment environment on the new neuron formation has been explored. In these studies, it was shown that rodents housed under enrichment conditions had an increased neurotrophin 3 (NT 3) and brain derived neurotrophic factor, as well as an increased hippocampal neurogenesis accomplished with the improvement in the water maze performance. In another study, described by Lazarov in 2005, the enrichment environment leads a reduction in the levels of cerebral beta-amyloid and an increase in the genes associated with learning-memory, neurogenesis and cell survival pathways. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that is characterized by motor neuron degeneration the new neuron formation is impaired. By using mutant mice for the superoxide dismutase-1 enzyme, an enzyme that is altered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with the precursor cells isolated from the subventricular zone of the this mutants there is a reduction in the incorporation of the DNA synthesis marker bromodeoxyuridine(BrdU), and in the response to mitogen stimulation, in presymptomatic and symptomatic mice, respectively.
   Evidence obtained so far,strongly suggest that neural stem cells manipulation can be a good possibility to induce the neuron replacement in the treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric illnesses. However it is necessary to go deeply in the mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the neurogenesis processes.

AB  - This study hypothesized that permanently frustrated, appetitive-foraging behavior caused the stereotypic pacing regularly observed in captive carnivores. Using 2 adult female snow leopards (Uncia uncia), solitarily housed in the Zurich Zoo, the study tested this hypothesis experimentally with a novel feeding method: electronically controlled, time-regulated feeding boxes. The expected result of employing this active foraging device as a successful coping strategy was reduced behavioral and physiological measures of stress, compared with a control-feeding regime without feeding boxes. The study assessed this through behavioral observations and by evaluating glucocorticoid levels noninvasively from feces. Results indicated that the 2 snow leopards did not perform successful coping behavior through exercising active foraging behavior or through displaying the stereotypic pacing. The data support a possible explanation: The box-feeding method did not provide the 2 snow leopards with the external stimuli to satisfy their appetitive behavioral needs. Moreover, numerous other factors not necessarily or exclusively related to appetitive behavior could have caused and influenced the stereotypic pacing.

AB  - Cocaine use leads to addiction in only a subset of individuals. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these individual differences in the transition from cocaine use to cocaine abuse is important to develop treatment strategies. There is agreement that specific behavioural traits increase the risk for addiction. As such, both high impulsivity and high anxiety have been reported to predict (compulsive) cocaine self-administration behaviour. Here, we set out a new view explaining how these two behavioural traits may affect addictive behaviour. According to psychological and psychiatric evolutionary views, organisms flourish well when they fit (match) their environment by trait and genotype. However, under non-fit conditions, the need to compensate the failure to deal with this environment increases, and, as a consequence, the functional use of rewarding drugs like cocaine may also increase. It suggests that neither impulsivity nor anxiety are bad per se, but that the increased risk to develop cocaine addiction is dependent on whether behavioural traits are adaptive or maladaptive in the environment to which the animals are exposed. This 'behavioural (mal) adaptation view' on individual differences in vulnerability to cocaine addiction may help to improve therapies for addiction.

AB  - The endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoyglycerol (2-AG) may contribute to the regulation of mood and emotion. In this study, we investigated the impact of the endocannabinoid transport inhibitor AM404 on three rat models of anxiety: elevated plus maze, defensive withdrawal and separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. AM404 (1-5 mg kg(-1), intraperitoneal (i.p.)) exerted dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effects in the three models. These behavioral effects were associated with increased levels of anandamide, but not 2-AG, in the prefrontal cortex and were prevented by the CB1 cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (SR141716A), suggesting that they were dependent on anandamide-mediated activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors. We also evaluated whether AM404 might influence motivation (in the conditioned place preference (CPP) test), sensory reactivity (acoustic startle reflex) and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex). In the CPP test, AM404 (1.25-10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) elicited rewarding effects in rats housed under enriched conditions, but not in rats kept in standard cages. Moreover, AM404 did not alter reactivity to sensory stimuli or cause overt perceptual distortion, as suggested by its lack of effect on startle or PPI of startle. These results support a role of anandamide in the regulation of emotion and point to the anandamide transport system as a potential target for anxiolytic drugs.

AB  - Background and Aims: Moderate physical exercise, dietary restriction as well as enriched environment in separate studies have been reported to delay some of the adverse effects of aging on brain function, parallel to an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In order to elucidate these influences in a comparative setting, we examined the tissue concentrations of BDNF in the cerebral parietotemporal cortex of old Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into six groups, living from 5 months (baseline group BL) up to 23 months of age as follows: voluntary running in wheels (RW), food restricted by feeding to pair weight with RW animals (PW), forced running on treadmills (TM), and sedentary controls with ad libitum access to food, either housed individually (S1) or in groups of 4 animals (S4). BDNF concentrations were determined by a commercially available ELISA. Results: We found higher BNDF concentrations in the 5 months old animals than in the 23 months old animals of group S1. The old sedentary group S4 showed significantly higher BNDF concentrations in comparison with the old individually caged groups RW, TM, PW and S1. Their BNDF concentrations were even higher than those of the young baseline group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that housing and social interactions have more influence on BDNF concentrations in the cerebral parietotemporal cortex of aging Sprague-Dawley rats than physical exercise and food restriction.

AB  - Anxiety is one of the most fundamental emotions required to survive or to cope with potential threatening stimuli. Under certain circumstances, it can change to excessive or maladaptive response and might manifest in anxious personality or even anxiety disorders. Genetic studies provide a number of promising candidate genes that, however, account for only a few percent of the phenotypic variance. Social and material environmental effects such as stressful life events, drugs or chemicals and particular behavioural influences such as parental care are suggested to interact with gene effects presumably involving epigenetic processes. Such interaction probably modifies an individual's predisposition, personality and susceptibility to develop normal or low anxiety or even maladaptive or excessive anxiety. Since human anxiety involves complex emotions as well as cognitions, unique experiences and an individual genetic make-up, studies trying to clarify the complex and functionally interwoven pathogenesis of anxious personality or anxiety disorders often adopt a reductionistic, simplifying approach. Therein, mice constitute an invaluable tool for modelling human anxiety in its various forms as they display remarkable similarities on anatomical, physiological, biochemical, molecular and behavioural levels. This review aims to fit observations and results obtained from men and mice on behavioural, genetic and environmental levels in response to different threatening stimuli elucidating different genetic and epigenetic effects.

AB  - The detrimental effects of T-cell-secreted interferon gamma (IFN) on oxidative stress (OS) and demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) are well recognized. Recently, we demonstrated that IFN-mediated damage to myelin also increases susceptibility to spreading depression (SD; the likely basis of migraine with aura). However, before onset of MS, induction of physiological levels of IFN, like that produced by environmental enrichment (EE), protects against demyelination and OS. Accordingly, we focused on the potential for physiological levels of IFN to protect against SD. EE, which occurs with a moderate and phasic increase in proinflammatory cytokines, reduces migraine frequency. Thus, we applied phasic or pulsed IFN to brain slice cultures to emulate EE. This treatment reduced OS, increased myelin basic protein, a marker for myelin, and reduced susceptibility to SD. Building on our research on exosomes in EE-based neuroprotection, we found that IFN stimulation of slice cultures induced release of exosomes, likely from the microglia that produce the same protective effects as IFN treatment when applied to naive cultures. Finally, nasal administration of IFN to rats recapitulated in vitro effects, reducing OS, increasing myelin, and reducing SD. These results support phasic IFN signaling as a therapeutic target for prevention of SD and, by extension, migraine.

AB  - Early life adversity (ELA) increases the risk of developing neuropsychiatric illnesses such as anxiety disorders. However, the mechanisms connecting these negative early life experiences to illness later in life remain unclear. In rodents, plasticity mechanisms, specifically adult neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus, have been shown to be altered by ELA and important for buffering against detrimental stress-induced outcomes. The current study sought to explore whether adult neurogenesis contributes to ELA-induced changes in avoidance behavior. Using the GFAP-TK transgenic model, which allows for the inhibition of adult neurogenesis, and CD1 littermate controls, we subjected mice to an ELA paradigm of maternal separation and early weaning (MSEW) or control rearing. We found that mice with intact adult neurogenesis showed no behavioral changes in response to MSEW. After reducing adult neurogenesis, however, male mice previously subjected to MSEW had an unexpected decrease in avoidance behavior. This finding was not observed in female mice, suggesting that a sex difference exists in the role of adult-born neurons in buffering against ELA-induced changes in behavior. Taken together with the existing literature on ELA and avoidance behavior, this work suggests that strain differences exist in susceptibility to ELA and that adult-born neurons may play a role in regulating adaptive behavior.

AB  - Prevention of stress-induced adverse effects is important for animals and humans to maintain their quality of life (QOL). Stress decreases the productivity of farm animals and induces abnormal behaviors, which is one of the major problems in animal welfare. In humans, stress increases the risk of mental illness which adversely impacts QOL. Stress is, thus, a common health problem for both animals and humans, and stress prevention and promotion of stress resilience could improve animal and human health and QOL. Among various stresses, psychosocial stress experienced by individuals is particularly difficult to prevent and it could, thus, prove beneficial to attempt to increase resilience to psychosocial stress. There exist a few critical interventions for promoting such resilience, environmental enrichment being one. However, this review describes recent progress in nutritional interventions that could confer resilience to psychosocial stress. The efficacy of this intervention is studied in the social defeat model mouse, which is a standard model for studying psychosocial stress. Several nutrients were found to rescue stress vulnerability using the models. Furthermore, probiotics and prebiotics became crucial dietary interventions for combating psychosocial stress. Collectively, dietary intake of appropriate nutrients will be more important for maintaining QOL in animals and humans.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence indicates that stress and aversive psychological conditions can affect cancer progression, while well-being protects against it. Although a large set of studies have addressed the impact of stress on cancer, not much is known about the mechanisms that protect from cancer in healthy psychological conditions. C57BL/6J mouse pups were exposed to an environmental enrichment condition consisting of being raised until weaning by the biological lactating mother plus a non-lactating virgin female (LnL = Lactating and non-Lactating mothers). The Control group consisted of mice raised by a single lactating mother (L = Lactating). Four months after weaning, mice from LnL and L conditions were exposed to intramuscular injection of 3-methylcolantrene (3MCA), a potent tumorigenic drug, and onset and progression of 3MCA-induced fibrosarcomas were monitored over time. Pups from the LnL compared to the L group received more parental care and were more resilient to stressful events during the first week of life. In association, the onset of tumors in LnL adults was significantly delayed. At the molecular level, we observed increased levels of wild-type p53 protein in tumor samples of LnL compared to L adults and higher levels of its target p21 in healthy muscles of LnL mice compared to the L group, supporting the hypothesis of potential involvement of p53 in tumor development. Our study sustains the model that early life care protects against tumor susceptibility.

AB  - Mice are the most commonly used laboratory animals for studying diseases, behaviour, and pharmacology. Behavioural experiment battery aids in evaluating abnormal behaviour in mice. During behavioural experiments, mice frequently experience human contact. However, the effects of repeated handling on mice behaviour remains unclear. To minimise mice stress, methods of moving mice using transparent tunnels or cups have been recommended but are impractical in behavioural tests. To investigate these effects, we used a behavioural test battery to assess differences between mice accustomed to the experimenter's handling versus control mice. Repeatedly handled mice gained slightly more weight than control mice. In behavioural tests, repeatedly handled mice showed improved spatial cognition in the Y-maze test and reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze test. However, there was no change in anxiety-like behaviour in the light/dark transition test or open-field test. Grip strength, rotarod, sociability, tail suspension, Porsolt forced swim, and passive avoidance tests revealed no significant differences between repeatedly handled and control mice. Our findings demonstrated that mice repeatedly handled by the experimenter before behavioural tests showed reduced anxiety about high altitudes and improved spatial cognition, suggesting that repeated contact can affect the results of some behavioural tests.

AB  - Captive animals are susceptible to chronic stress due to restricted space, lack of hiding places, presence of visitors, or the lack of resources that promote physical and mental stimuli. In birds, chronic stress can promote stereotypes, self-mutilation, feather picking, chewing on cage bars and walls, fearfulness and excessive aggression. Environmental enrichment (EE) becomes an important management tool to decrease chronic stress in captive animals. In our study, captive blue-and-yellow macaws (n = 22) kept in zoos in Brazil were exposed to EE in three experimental phases (pre-enrichment - no objects added to the cage; enrichment - physical, occupational and food items added; and post-enrichment - no objects added to the cage). Their behaviors were monitored by focal sampling and excreta were collected three times a week. Frequency of the behavior occur. rence and correlation between behavioral data and corticosterone metabolites (CM) levels in droppings were assessed. "Vocalization", "Movement" and "Resting" were the behaviors that occurred more frequently during the three phases. Abnormal behaviors showed no significant difference between phases, but "Biting itself" and "Pacing" decreased significantly from the pre-enrichment to the enrichment phase (p = 0.042 and p = 0.012, respectively), while "Standing on grid ceiling" increased significantly from pre-enrichment to enrichment phase (p = 0.002). Locomotion (p = 0.018) and movement (p = 0.003) were increased, whereas vocalization (p = 0.007), preening (p < 0.001) and feather bristling (p < 0.001) were reduced during the EE phase compared to the pre-enrichment phase. Macaws interacted more frequently with "Sunflower rolls" (24.4%), "Stuffed pinecones" (21.1%), "Dried corncobs" (17.0%) and "Egg boxes" (13.3%). Individual differences in preference for EE items were also observed. CM levels did not differ between the three phases (p = 0.798). "Locomotion" and CM levels were negatively correlated in the pre-enrichment phase (r = - 0.58; p = 0.033), suggesting that more active macaws cope better with stress. "Abnormal behaviors" were not correlated to CM levels. Our results provide evidence for the positive effects of EE on behavior and suggest that it could be used for improving the quality of life in parrots and other captive birds.

AB  - Normal axonal mitochondrial transport and function is essential for the maintenance of synaptic function. Abnormal mitochondrial motility and mitochondrial dysfunction within axons are critical for amyloid beta (A beta)-induced synaptic stress and the loss of synapses relevant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms controlling axonal mitochondrial function and transport alterations in AD remain elusive. Here, we report an unexplored role of cyclophilin D (CypD)-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in A beta-impaired axonal mitochondrial trafficking. Depletion of CypD significantly protects axonal mitochondrial motility and dynamics from A beta toxicity as shown by increased axonal mitochondrial density and distribution and improved bidirectional transport of axonal mitochondria. Notably, blockade of mPTP by genetic deletion of CypD suppresses A beta-mediated activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, reverses axonal mitochondrial abnormalities, improves synaptic function, and attenuates loss of synapse, suggesting a role of CypD-dependent signaling in A beta-induced alterations in axonal mitochondrial trafficking. The potential mechanisms of the protective effects of lacking CypD on A beta-induced abnormal mitochondrial transport in axon are increased axonal calcium buffer capability, diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS), and suppressing downstream signal transduction P38 activation. These findings provide new insights into CypD-dependent mitochondrial mPTP and signaling on mitochondrial trafficking in axons and synaptic degeneration in an environment enriched for A beta.

AB  - In the present study, we investigated the effects of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on brain tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels. We directly measured levels of BH4 by Tani and Ohno's direct method as well as the serotonin (5-HT) turnover ratio, i.e. 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT, after sub-acute s.c. injection of fluvoxamine in the hippocampus of mice. Our animal model incorporated two risk factors of depression, social isolation and acute environmental change. Male ddY mice (6W) were housed in isolation (I per cage; 35 days), injected with fluvoxamine (20 or 40 mg/kg; days 29-35), and exposed to novelty stress (20 min, day 35). In the stress session, behavioral parameters, i.e. total distance and rearing behavior, were measured. Isolation housing increased both behaviors. Fluvoxamine attenuated rearing behavior, but did not influence total distance. Isolation housing increased BH4 levels. Novelty stress increased BH4 levels in group housing, although it did not change them in isolation housing. Fluvoxamine suppressed BH4 levels. In isolation housing, fluvoxamine increased 5-HT turnover ratios, while it decreased them in group housing. In conclusion, fluvoxamine, housing condition, and novelty stress regulated BH4 levels. Fluvoxamine may have changed behavior and 5-HT turnover by suppressing BH4 levels as well as by inhibiting 5-HT reuptake. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of exercise on mental health, on cognition, brain function and brain structure as well as the possible underlying molecular systems important for maintaining neural function and plasticity has been extensively examined. Moreover, numerous studies have reinforced t the important and beneficial role of exercise for those with neurological disorders. This article reviews general aspects of physical exercise against neurodegenerative diseases and the relevant contributions of physical exercise programs as complementary therapy for epilepsy. We first give an overview of the plasticity induced by exercise in the damaged brain, the impact of exercise in reducing brain injury as well as in delaying onset of and decline in several neurodegenerative diseases. We address the relationship between epilepsy and exercise and report the neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects of exercise on epilepsy based on experimental and clinical studies. Overall, we conclude that physical or sport activities represent an exciting intervention that should be integrated with conventional therapy for the improvement of brain function and resistance to neurodegenerative diseases as well as a complementary non-pharmacological treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Behaviour problems are common in companion felines, and problematic behaviour may be a sign of chronic stress. In laboratory animals, early weaning increases the risk for aggression, anxiety, and stereotypic behaviour. However, very few studies have focused on early weaning in one of the world's most popular pets, the domestic cat, although weaning soon after the critical period of socialisation is common practice. To study the effects of early weaning (< 12 weeks) on behaviour, a large data set (N = 5726, 40 breeds) was collected from home-living domestic cats through a questionnaire survey. The results show that weaning before 8 weeks of age increases the risk for aggression, but not fearful behaviour. Moreover, cats weaned after 14 weeks of age have a lower probability for aggression towards strangers than early weaned cats and a lower probability for stereotypic behaviour (excessive grooming) than cats weaned at 12 weeks. The effect of weaning age on stereotypic behaviour is partially explained by the effects on aggression. These findings indicate that early weaning has a detrimental effect on behaviour, and suggest delayed weaning as a simple and inexpensive approach to significantly improve the welfare of millions of domestic cats.

AB  - Social isolation of rats induces a constellation of behavioral alterations known as "isolation syndrome" that are consistent with some of the positive and cognitive symptoms observed in schizophrenic patients. In the present study we have assessed whether isolation rearing of inbred Roman high-avoidance (RHA-I) and Roman low-avoidance (RLA-I) strains can lead to the appearance of some of the key features of the "isolation syndrome", such as prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits, increased anxious behavior, hyperactivity and memory/learning impairments. Compared to RLA-I rats, the results show that isolation rearing (IR) in RHA-I rats has a more profound impact, as they exhibit isolation-induced PPI deficits, increased anxiety, hyperactivity and long-term reference memory deficits, while isolated RLA-I rats only exhibit deficits in a spatial working memory task. These results give further support to the validity of RHA-I rats as a genetically-based model of schizophrenia relevant-symptoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nest Making and Oxytocin Comparably Promote Wound Healing in Isolation Reared Rats
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Environmental enrichment (EE) fosters attachment behavior through its effect on brain oxytocin levels in the hippocampus and other brain regions, which in turn modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Social isolation and other stressors negatively impact physical healing through their effect on the HPA. Therefore, we reasoned that: 1) provision of a rat EE (nest building with NestletsH) would improve wound healing in rats undergoing stress due to isolation rearing and 2) that oxytocin would have a similar beneficial effect on wound healing.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In the first two experiments, we provided isolation reared rats with either EE or oxytocin and compared their wound healing to group reared rats and isolation reared rats that did not receive Nestlets or oxytocin. In the third experiment, we examined the effect of Nestlets on open field locomotion and immediate early gene (IEG) expression. We found that isolation reared rats treated with Nestlets a) healed significantly better than without Nestlets, 2) healed at a similar rate to rats treated with oxytocin, 3) had decreased hyperactivity in the open field test, and 4) had normalized IEG expression in brain hippocampus.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study shows that when an EE strategy or oxytocin is given to isolation reared rats, the peripheral stress response, as measured by burn injury healing, is decreased. The findings indicate an association between the effect of nest making on wound healing and administration of the pro-bonding hormone oxytocin. Further elucidation of this animal model should lead to improved understanding of how EE strategies can ameliorate poor wound healing and other symptoms that result from isolation stress.

AB  - Group housing is highly important for social animals. However, it can also give rise to aggression, one of the most serious welfare concerns in laboratory mouse husbandry. Severe fighting can lead to pain, injury and even death. In addition, working with animals that are severely socially stressed, wounded or singly housed as a result of aggression may compromise scientific validity. Some general recommendations on how to minimize aggression exist, but the problem persists. Thus far, studies attempting to find solutions have mainly focused on social dominance and territorial behavior, but many other aspects of routine housing and husbandry that might influence aggressive behavior have been overlooked. The present way of housing laboratory mice is highly unnatural: mice are prevented from performing many species typical behaviors and are routinely subjected to painful and aversive stimuli. Giving animals control over their environment is an important aspect of improving animal welfare and has been well-studied in the field of animal welfare science. How control over the environment influences aggression in laboratory mice, however, has not been closely examined. In this article, we challenge current ways of thinking and propose alternative perspectives that we hope will lead to an enhanced understanding of aggression in laboratory mice.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family that plays a critical role in numerous neuronal activities. Recent studies have indicated that some functions or action mechanisms of BDNF vary in a sex-dependent manner. In particular, BDNF content in some brain parts and the tendency to develop BDNF deficiency-related diseases such as depression are greater in female animals. With the support of relevant studies, it has been suggested that sex hormones or steroids can modulate the activities of BDNF, which may account for its functional discrepancy in different sexes. Indeed, the cross-talk between BDNF and sex steroids has been detected for decades, and some sex steroids, such as estrogen, have a positive regulatory effect on BDNF expression and signaling. Thus, the sex of animal models that are used in studying the functions of BDNF is critical. This Mini-Review summarizes our current findings on the differences in expression, signaling, and functions of BDNF between sexes. We also discuss the potential mechanisms for mediating these differential responses, with a specific emphasis on sex steroids. By presenting and discussing these findings, we seek to encourage researchers to take sex influences into consideration when designing experiments, interpreting results, and drawing conclusions.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are one of the leading causes of disability in the United States (US). Current treatments are not always effective and less than 50% of patients achieve full remission. A critical step in developing a novel anxiolytic is to develop and utilize an animal model, such as mice, to study pathological changes and test drug target(s), efficacy, and safety. Current approaches include genetic manipulation, chronic administration of anxiety-inducing molecules, or the administration of environmental stress. These methods, however, may not realistically reflect anxiety induced throughout daily life. This protocol describes a novel anxiety model, which mimics the intentional or unintentional patterns of social isolation in modern life. The social isolation-induced anxiety model minimizes perceived distractions and invasiveness and utilizes wild type C57BL/6 mice. In this protocol, 6- to 8-week-old mice (male and female) are singly housed in opaque cages to visually block the external environment, such as neighboring mice, for 4 weeks. No environmental enrichments (such as toys) are provided, bedding material is reduced by 50%, any treatment of drug is administered as an agar form, and the exposure/handling of the mice is minimized. Socially isolated mice generated using this protocol exhibit greater anxiety-like behavior, aggression, as well as decreased cognition.

AB  - Background - Burnout is generally recognized as a work-related stress-induced condition associated with memory problems, fatigue, a sense of inadequacy, and depressed mood. Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons in the human adult brain, provides a newly discovered dimension of brain plasticity. Objectives - In a novel theory, we propose that the failure of adult hippocampal neurogenesis may provide the biological and cellular basis for altered brain plasticity in stress-related syndromes like burnout. Methods - A number of recent animal studies have shown that the rate of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus may provide an important neurobiological correlate to the symptoms of stress. Results - As of yet, the normal physiological function of new neurons in the adult hippocampus remains unresolved although a number of studies and reviews indicate the importance of neurogenesis for memory and learning. Conclusion - In line with this hypothesis, we propose burnout to be an exponent of stress-mediated decrease in adult neurogenesis leading to a decreased ability to cope with stress through decreased hippocampal function possibly involving a disturbed hippocampal regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis).

AB  - The Swiss sublines of Roman high-(RHA/Verh) and low-(RLA/Verh) avoidance rats have been genetically selected for good vs. poor performance in two-way active avoidance since 1972. RLA/Verh rats show increased stress responses (e.g. freezing behaviour, ACTH, corticosterone and prolactin secretion) and adopt a more passive (or reactive) coping style when confronted with a novel environment. In the open field, elevated plus-maze, black/white box test, and in a new light/dark open field test, RLA/Verh rats appear to be more anxious than their RHA/Verh counterparts. Anxiety may result from their particular psychophysiological profile, i.e. increased emotionality combined with a passive coping style. In contrast, RHA/Verh rats are less responsive to stress, they show little anxiety in novel situations and tend to be impulsive and novelty (sensation) seekers. Some behavioural differences are already noticeable shortly after birth, but the full pattern appears to stabilize only after puberty. Gene-environment interactions are critical in establishing this pattern. The data reviewed indicate that the differences between RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh rats probably result from a complex interaction among divergent anxiety/emotionality characteristics, differences in locomotor activity and novelty/reward seeking, as well as active vs. passive coping styles. It is proposed further that these divergent personality types are to be found not only in other selective breeding programs but in the form of individual differences in most populations of rats used for this type of research.

AB  - Variation in common personality traits, such as boldness or exploration, is often associated with risk-reward trade-offs and behavioural flexibility. To date, only a few studies have examined the effects of consistent behavioural traits on both learning and cognition. We investigated whether certain personality traits ('exploration' and 'sociability') of individuals were related to cognitive performance, learning flexibility and learning style in a social ungulate species, the goat (Capra hircus). We also investigated whether a preference for feature cues rather than impaired learning abilities can explain performance variation in a visual discrimination task. We found that personality scores were consistent across time and context. Less explorative goats performed better in a non-associative cognitive task, in which subjects had to follow the trajectory of a hidden object (i.e. testing their ability for object permanence). We also found that less sociable subjects performed better compared to more sociable goats in a visual discrimination task. Good visual learning performance was associated with a preference for feature cues, indicating personality-dependent learning strategies in goats. Our results suggest that personality traits predict the outcome in visual discrimination and non-associative cognitive tasks in goats and that impaired performance in a visual discrimination tasks does not necessarily imply impaired learning capacities, but rather can be explained by a varying preference for feature cues.

AB  - Locomotor stereotypies are behaviors often seen in singly housed rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and are considered to represent a maladaptive response to captive environments. Active and passive enrichment items are commonly used to mitigate these and other abnormal behaviors. Active enrichment items allow physical manipulation and may be temporarily successful in reducing stereotypies, but their beneficial effects usually are confined to relatively short periods of active use. Passive enrichment items that do not involve physical manipulation are less well studied, and the results are mixed. This study evaluated an aquarium with live fish for use as a novel passive enrichment item in a common facility setting as a means to decrease locomotor stereotypy. We hypothesized that the introduction of the aquarium would decrease the frequency of locomotor stereotypy in a group of singly housed rhesus macaques (n = 11) with a known history of abnormal behaviors. Unexpectedly, locomotor stereotypy increased with the introduction of the aquarium and then decreased overtime. Furthermore, when the aquarium was removed, the frequency of stereotypy decreased to below baseline levels. These unexpected results are best explained by neophobia, a common phenomenon documented in many animal species. The increase in abnormal behavior is likely to result from the addition of a novel object within the environment. This study demonstrates that, in the context of reducing abnormal behavior, presumably innocuous enrichment items may have unexpected effects and should be evaluated critically after their introduction to a captive population.

AB  - Neuroprotective therapies and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) have limited application for most stroke patients and thus rehabilitation is the primary treatment option for improving recovery of function. Following brain injury, environmental enrichment, pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments can markedly alter neuronal plasticity and behavioral recovery even when delayed by several weeks after the insult. Fluoxetine has been given to stroke patients to combat depression but its effects on recovery of function are not known. Functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals that fluoxetine alters brain activity and modulates motor performance in stroke patients in a use-dependent fashion. Several antidepressants, including fluoxetine, increase growth factors and other proteins associated with plasticity, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In this study, we examined whether chronic administration of fluoxetine combined with rehabilitation affected recovery of function on 3 separate tests of forelimb reaching, preference and limb coordination after focal ischemia in rats. Ischemia was induced in male Long-Evans rats by intracortical and striatal injections of endothelin-1. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) combined with rehabilitation therapy (6 h/day) for 4 weeks did not alter the degree or rate of recovery of function compared to non-treated animals. Despite the ability of fluoxetine to alter brain activity and increase growth factors, it does not appear to be an effective pharmacological adjunct to functional recovery after ischemia in rats.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in children and adolescents. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently develops in these patients, leading to a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes. Currently, few therapeutic strategies are available to treat juveniles with PTSD and other developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present investigation, postnatal day 14 (P14) Wistar rats were subjected to TBI induced by a controlled cortical impact (CCI) (velocity = 3 m/s, depth = 2.0 mm, contact time = 150 ms). This TBI injury resulted in not only cortical damages, but also posttrauma social behavior deficits. Three days after TBI, rats were treated with intracranial transplantation of either mouse iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells under normal culture conditions (N-iPSC-NPCs) or mouse iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells pretreated with hypoxic preconditioning (HP-iPSC-NPCs). Compared to TBI animals that received N-iPSC-NPCs or vehicle treatment, HP-iPSC-NPC-transplanted animals showed a unique benefit of improved performance in social interaction, social novelty, and social transmission of food preference tests. Western blotting showed that HP-iPSC-NPCs expressed significantly higher levels of the social behavior -related genes oxytocin and the oxytocin receptor. Overall, HP-iPSC-NPC transplantation exhibits a great potential as a regenerative therapy to improve neuropsychiatric outcomes after juvenile TBI.

AB  - Postweaning social isolation can influence the sensitivity of rats to several effects of drugs of abuse. The present study investigated the influence of postweaning housing conditions on the sensitivity of rats to the aversive effects of a number of psychoactive agents using a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) test procedure. Development of a CTA was assessed by pairing administration of the drug with the consumption of a 0.05% (weight/volume) saccharin solution in water-deprived (18 h) rats in a 20 min drinking period. Saccharin consumption was then measured in 20 min test sessions over the next 4 consecutive days. Consumption of saccharin solution was significantly reduced in both isolated and enriched rats following administration of d-amphetamine (2 mg/kg), cocaine (30 mg/kg), morphine (10 mg/kg), nicotine (1.0 mg/kg), caffeine (20 mg/kg), alcohol (1.5 g/kg), and LiCl (0.15 M, 4 ml/kg). There was no significant effect of housing conditions on the CTA induced by cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, or LiCl; however, isolation reared rats were found to be less sensitive to the aversive effects of d-amphetamine, morphine, and caffeine in this paradigm. These results suggest that rearing rats in social isolation induces an attenuation insensitivity to the aversive effects of some psychoactive agents. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been associated with many effects on the behavior of laboratory animals. The term EE is rather vague, often referring to a variety of item combinations as if what is added to the cage has no significance. EE is indeed housing refinement, and therefore more exact terms should be used to clarify the situation. This study was designed to assess whether access to a nest box (NB) could modify behavior of BALB/c mice in the plus-maze test. Two series of experiments were done with an aspen NB (11 x 11 x 7 cm, wall thickness 1.5 cm, two round holes (d = 3 cm) at opposite sides. Control mice had no added item in the cage. The plus-maze consisted of two open (8 x 17 cm) and two closed arms (8 x 17 x 30 cm) connected by a central platform (8 x 8 cm). Mice were placed on the central platform facing an open arm. During five minutes, the numbers of entries made onto the open and into the closed arms were recorded. From this data, the percentages of entries made onto the open arms, and the percentage of time spent on the open arms, were calculated. Furthermore, the number of fecal boli left by the mice in the plus-maze, as a stress indicator, were counted. In the first series of experiments NB was present for one, two and three weeks but no drugs were administered. NB provided for one or two weeks had no effect on the behavior of mice. However, exposure to NB for three weeks did decrease the locomotor activity of mice in the plus-maze test, as reflected in the decline in the total number of entries made in the test. The presence of NB for one or two weeks resulted in more (p = 0.001) fecal boli voided when compared to the no NB or NB for three weeks groups.
   In the second series of experiments we used NB for 10 days and the selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor 1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)-imidazole (TRIM) as a pharmacological tool (at doses of 25.0, 50.0 and 100.0 mg/kg, i.p.). Depending on the dose, the administration of TRIM induced an anxiolytic (50 mg/kg) or sedative effect (100 mg/kg) as seen in the increase in the percentage of entries made onto the open arms or a decrease in the total number of entries, respectively. NB for 10 days had no effect on the behavior of mice or on the effect of TRIM. In conclusion, NB does not appear to interfere with the anxiolytic effect of TRIM in the plus-maze test but prolonged exposure to NB does reduce the locomotor activity of mice.

AB  - The ways in which challenging environments during development shape the brain and behaviour are increasingly being addressed. To date, studies typically consider only single variables, but the real world is more complex. Many factors simultaneously affect the brain and behaviour, and whether these work independently or interact remains untested. To address this, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were reared in a two-by-two design in housing that varied in structural complexity and/ or exposure to a stressor. Fish experiencing both complexity (enrichment objects changed over time) and mild stress (daily net chasing) exhibited enhanced learning and were less anxious when tested as juveniles (between 77 and 90 days). Adults tested (aged 1 year) were also less anxious even though fish were kept in standard housing after three months of age (i.e. no chasing or enrichment). Volumetric measures of the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that complexity alone generated fish with a larger brain, but this increase in size was not seen in fish that experienced both complexity and chasing, or chasing alone. The results highlight the importance of looking at multiple variables simultaneously, and reveal differential effects of complexity and stressful experiences during development of the brain and behaviour.

AB  - Inter-individual differences in neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to environmental challenges will be considered within the context of psychogenetic selection, using the Roman High-(RHA) and Low-(RLA) Avoidance rat lines as an example. We assume that the selected genotypes, by interacting with environmental factors, determine specific 'biobehavioural profiles'. Practical and theoretical problems regarding the measurement of inter-individual vs line/strain differences, the definition of 'traits' vs experimental variables, and possible correlations between physiological and behavioural parameters will be discussed. We will argue that environmental influences are the main cause of inter-individual variability, and that the genotype only constitutes a 'blueprint' from which typical biobehavioural profiles are established, notably under the influence of early environmental factors. These biobehavioural profiles may correspond in part to human categories known as 'types', 'temperaments' or 'personality traits'. Within each category (including those which can be obtained by psychogenetic selection), more individual personality traits can evolve, notably as a result of social interactions and particular life events.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of brief daily periods of social interaction on social-isolation-induced behavioral and hormonal alterations and deficits. Adult male Wistar rats were allocated to one of three housing conditions: 1) social housing (two per cage); 2) social isolation (one per cage); or partial social isolation (one per cage with access to another male rat for 60 min/day). After 14 days in these different housing conditions, the animals were subjected to various behavioral tests, including sucrose preference test, acoustic startle response, two-way active shuttle avoidance, pre-pulse inhibition, open field, cooperation learning task, and levels of corticosterone. Results revealed that social isolation had a substantial impact on rats' performance on most behavioral tests as well as on their corticosterone levels. Importantly, however, the results clearly demonstrate that allowing otherwise isolated animals to have a brief (60 min) daily social contact with another rat to a great extent abolishes or ameliorates most of the isolation-induced behavioral and hormonal alterations. Hence, providing isolated animals with brief daily periods of social contact may be used as a "preventive treatment" in order to protect them from the deleterious effects of isolation.

AB  - Early-life stress (ELS) or adversity, particularly in the form of childhood neglect and abuse, is associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes in adulthood. However, whether these relationships are mediated by the consequences of ELS itself or by other exposures that frequently co-occur with ELS is unclear. To address this question, we carried out a longitudinal study in rats to isolate the effects of ELS on regional brain volumes and behavioral phenotypes relevant to anxiety and depression. We used the repeated maternal separation (RMS) model of chronic ELS, and conducted behavioral measurements throughout adulthood, including of probabilistic reversal learning (PRL), responding on a progressive ratio task, sucrose preference, novelty preference, novelty reactivity, and putative anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze. Our behavioral assessment was combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for quantitation of regional brain volumes at three time points: immediately following RMS, young adulthood without further stress, and late adulthood with further stress. We found that RMS caused long-lasting, sexually dimorphic biased responding to negative feedback on the PRL task. RMS also slowed response time on the PRL task, but without this directly impacting task performance. RMS animals were also uniquely sensitive to a second stressor, which disproportionately impaired their performance and slowed their responding on the PRL task. MRI at the time of the adult stress revealed a larger amygdala volume in RMS animals compared with controls. These behavioral and neurobiological effects persisted well into adulthood despite a lack of effects on conventional tests of 'depression-like' and 'anxiety-like' behavior, and a lack of any evidence of anhedonia. Our findings indicate that ELS has long-lasting cognitive and neurobehavioral effects that interact with stress in adulthood and may have relevance for understanding the etiology of anxiety and depression in humans.

AB  - Adolescence is accompanied by increased vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and eating disorders. The hippocampus is important for regulating emotional state through its ventral compartment and spatial cognition through its dorsal compartment. Previous animal studies have examined hippocampal development at stages before, after or at single time points during adolescence. However, only one study has investigated morphological changes at multiple time points during adolescence, and no study has yet compared developmental changes of dorsal versus ventral hippocampi. We analyzed the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of rats to determine the developmental trajectory of Golgi-stained hippocampal CA1 neurons by sampling at five time points, ranging from postnatal day (P) 35 (puberty) to 55 (end of adolescence). We show that the dorsal hippocampus undergoes transient dendritic retractions in stratum radiatum (SR), while the ventral hippocampus undergoes transient dendritic growths in SR. During adulthood, stress and hormonal fluctuations have been shown to alter the physiology and morphology of hippocampal neurons, but studies of the impact of these factors upon adolescent hippocampi are scarce. In addition, we show that female-female pair housing from P 36-44 significantly increases branching in the dorsal SR and reduces branching in the ventral SR. Taken together with data on spine density, these results indicate that pyramidal cells in the dorsal and ventral CA1 of female adolescents are remodeled differently following single housing. Social housing during adolescence elicits pathway-specific changes in the hippocampus that may underlie behavioral benefits, including stability of emotion regulation and superior cognition.

AB  - Rearing in crowded conditions is a psychosocial stressor that affects biological functions. The effects of continuous crowding for many days have been studied, but those of crowding over a limited time have not. In this study, we examined the effects of night-time or daytime crowding over 2 weeks on behavior in adolescent and adult mice. Crowding (20 mice/cage) in either the night-time or daytime did not affect locomotor activity in the open field test or cognitive function in the fear conditioning test. In contrast, night-time crowding, but not daytime crowding, had an anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus-maze test and increased social interaction in adolescent mice, but not in adult mice. The first night-time, but not daytime, crowding increased plasma corticosterone levels in adolescent mice, although night-time crowding over 2 weeks did not affect the corticosterone levels. Furthermore, no significant effects of the first crowding were observed in adult mice. In a second crowding condition (six mice/small cage), the anxiolytic-like effects of night-time crowding and the change in plasma corticosterone levels were not observed, suggesting that the density of mice is not important for the behavioral consequences of crowding. Night-time crowding did not affect neurotrophic/growth factor levels and hippocampal neurogenesis in adolescent mice. These findings suggest that night-time crowding leads to anxiolytic-like behaviors in adolescent mice, and imply that night-time crowding stress in adolescence may be beneficial to brain functions.

AB  - Neurogenesis continues through adulthood in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb of mammals. Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory, and linked with depression. Hippocampal neurogenesis is increased in response to a number of stimuli, including exposure to an enriched environment, increased locomotor activity, and administration of antidepressants. Adult neurogenesis is depressed in response to aging, stress and sleep deprivation. Intriguingly, caffeine modulates a number of these same stimuli in a dose dependent manner. We examined the dose and duration dependent effects of caffeine on the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of newly generated hippocampal neurons in adult mice. Extended, 7 day caffeine administration, alters the proliferation of adult hippocampal precursors in the mouse in a dose dependent manner: moderate to high doses (20-30 mg/kg per day) of caffeine depress proliferation while supraphysiological doses (60 mg/kg per day) increase proliferation of neuronal precursors. Acute, I day administration had no affect on proliferation. Caffeine administration does not affect the expression of early or late markers of neuronal differentiation, or rates of long-term survival. However, neurons induced in response to supraphysiological levels of caffeine have a lower survival rate than control cells; increased proliferation does not yield an increase in long-term neurogenesis. These results demonstrate that physiologically relevant doses of caffeine can significantly depress adult hippocampal neurogenesis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analysed the effect of a modified pen using a wooden screen with flaps and cereal straw as forage and bedding, on behaviour, stress response, performance and meat quality variables of lambs housed in feedlots. Sixty male lambs were placed in enriched (ESF) or conventional (CO) pens (3 pens/treatment, 10 lambs/pen). The CO environment was barren. The ESF lambs showed a great preference for the provided items, which encouraged more natural and richer behaviour, reducing stereotypies and lamb aggressions, and increasing affiliations (P <= 0.05), which improves group cohesion. However, ESF lambs also developed a more natural coping style to the handling, evidenced by the higher cortisol levels (65.4 vs. 43.8 nmol/L) and a higher eye temperature as response to the reactivity test (38.1 vs. 37.8 degrees C). The FSF lambs had a higher (P <= 0.05) slaughter weight (272 vs. 263 kg), conformation score (7.38 vs. 6.07) and pH 24 (5.63 vs. 5.56) but lower cooking losses (12.9 vs. 14.9%) than CO lambs.

AB  - studies clearly indicate that early-life stress (ELS) may cause physical and mental health problems later in life. Therefore, the identification of universal biomarkers of ELS-related diseases is very important. The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70s), specifically HSPA5 and HSPA1B, have been recently shown to be potentially associated with occurrence of anxiety, mood disorders, and schizophrenia; thus, we hypothesized that HSP70s are potential candidate biomarkers of ELS-induced psychopathologies. A maternal separation (MS) procedure in rats was used to model ELS, and the expression of HSPA5 and HSPA1B was investigated in the blood, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus of juvenile, preadolescent, and adult animals. We also studied the effects of MS on the long-term potentiation (LTP) and behavioral phenotypes of adult rats. We found that MS enhanced the expression of HSPA1B mRNA in the blood and mPFC of juvenile and preadolescent rats. This increase was accompanied by an increase in the HSPA1A/1B protein levels in the mPFC and hippocampus of juvenile rats that persisted in the mPFC until adulthood. MS juvenile and adult rats showed enhanced HSPA5 mRNA expression in the blood and increased HSPA5 protein expression in the mPFC (juveniles) and hippocampus (adults). Concurrently, MS adult rats exhibited aberrations in LTP in the mPFC and hippocampus and a less anxious behavioral phenotype. These results indicate that MS may produce enduring overexpression of HSPA1B and HSPA5 in the brain and blood. Therefore, both HSP70 family members may be potential candidate peripheral and brain biomarkers of ELS-induced changes in brain functioning. ? 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study explored the influence of five types of olfactory stimulation (control, lavender, chamomile, rosemary and peppermint) on the behaviour of 55 dogs housed in a rescue shelter. The dogs were exposed to each type of olfactory stimulation, through the diffusion of essential oils, for 4 h a day for 5 days, with an intervening period of 2 days between conditions. The dogs' behaviour was recorded on days 1, 3 and 5, during each condition of olfactory stimulation. Certain aspects of the dogs' behaviour were influenced by the odours. Dogs spent more time resting and less time moving upon exposure to lavender and chamomile than any of the other olfactory stimuli. These odourants also encouraged less vocalisation than other types of aroma. The diffusion of rosemary and peppermint into the dogs' environment encouraged significantly more standing, moving and vocalising than other types of odour. It is suggested that the welfare of sheltered dogs may be enhanced through exposure to appropriate forms of olfactory stimulation. Lavender and chamomile appear particularly beneficial, resulting in activities suggestive of relaxation and behaviours that are considered desirable by potential adopters. These types of olfactory stimulation may also appeal to visitors, resulting in enhanced perceptions of the rescue shelter and an increased desire to adopt a dog from such an environment.

Several rodent and primate models of early adverse experience have been analyzed in this review, including those that "model" maternal separation or loss, abuse or neglect, and social deprivation. Accumulating evidence shows that these early traumatic experiences are associated with long-term alterations in coping style, emotional and behavioral regulation. neuroendocrine responsiveness to stress, social "fitness," cognitive function. brain morphology. neurochemistry, and expression levels of central nervous system genes that have been related to anxiety and mood disorders. Studies are underway to identify important aspects of adverse early experience. such as (a) the existence of "sensitive periods" during development associated with alterations in particular output systems, (b) the presence of "windows of opportunity" during which targeted interventions (e.g., nurturant parenting or supportive-enriching environment) may prevent or reverse dysfunction. (c) the identity of gene polymorphisms contributing to the individual's variability in vulnerability, and (d) a means to translate the timing of these developmental "sensitive periods" across species.

AB  - The later stages of long-term potentiation (LTP) in vitro and spatial memory in vivo are believed to depend upon gene transcription. Accordingly, considerable attempts have been made to identify both the mechanisms by which transcription is regulated and indeed the gene products themselves. Previous studies have shown that deletion of one regulator of transcription, the mitogen-and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1), causes an impairment of spatial memory. Given the ability of MSK1 to regulate gene expression via the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) at serine 133 (S133), MSK1 is a plausible candidate as a prime regulator of transcription underpinning synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Indeed, prior work has revealed the necessity for MSK1 in homeostatic and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, using a knock-in kinase-dead mouse mutant of MSK1, the current study demonstrates that, while the kinase function of MSK1 is important in regulating the phosphorylation of CREB at S133 and basal synaptic transmission in hippocampal area CA1, it is not required for metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD), two forms of LTP or several forms of spatial learning in the watermaze. These data indicate that other functions of MSK1, such as a structural role for the whole enzyme, may explain previous observations of a role for MSK1 in learning and memory.

AB  - Variations in early life maternal care modulate hippocampal development to program distinct emotional-cognitive phenotypes that persist into adulthood. Adult rat offspring that received low compared with high levels of maternal licking and grooming (low LG offspring) in early postnatal life show reduced long term potentiation (LTP) and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory, suggesting a 'detrimental' maternal effect on neural development. However, these studies focused uniquely on the dorsal hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests a distinct role of the ventral hippocampus in mediating aggression, anxiety, and fear-memory formation, which are enhanced in low LG offspring. We report that variations in maternal care in the rat associate with opposing effects on hippocampal function in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Reduced pup licking associated with suppressed LTP formation in the dorsal hippocampus, but enhanced ventral hippocampal LTP. Ventral hippocampal neurons in low LG offspring fired action potentials at lower threshold voltages that were of larger amplitude and faster rise rate in comparison with those in high LG offspring. Furthermore, recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potential-to-spike coupling (E-S coupling) revealed an increase in excitability of ventral hippocampal CA1 neurons in low LG offspring. These effects do not associate with changes in miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents or paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting a specific effect of maternal care on intrinsic excitability. These findings suggest region-specific influences of maternal care in shaping neural development and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - More than 24,000 rodent studies are published annually, with the vast majority of these studies focused on genetically undiverse animals in highly-controlled laboratory settings. However, findings from the laboratory have become increasingly unreliable for predicting outcomes in field and clinical settings, leading to a perceived crisis in translational research. One cause of this disparity might be that most human societies, in contrast to laboratory rodents, are genetically diverse and live in super-enriched environments. Methods for importing wild rats into the laboratory, and also exporting laboratory-style chambers into natural environments are not wellknown outside their respective disciplines. Therefore, we have reviewed the current status of supplements to the laboratory rodent assay. We progress logically from highly-controlled experiments with natural breeding colonies to purely naturalistic approaches with free-ranging rats. We then highlight a number of approaches that allow genetically-diverse wild rats to be utilized in context-enriched paradigms. While considering the benefits and shortcomings of each available approach, we detail protocols for random sampling, remote-sensing, and deployment of laboratory chambers in the field. As supplements to standardized laboratory trials, some of these assays could offer key insights to help unify outcomes between laboratory and field studies. However, we note several outstanding questions that must be addressed such as: the trade-off between control and context, possible reductions in sample size, ramifications for the 'standardization fallacy', and ethical dilemmas of working with wild animals. Given these challenges, further innovation will be required before supplemental assays can be made broadly-accessible and thus, transferrable across disciplines.

AB  - Coping with emotional stressors strongly impacts older people due to their age-related impaired neuroendocrine and immune systems. Elevated cortisol levels seem to be associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), alterations in the innate immune system result in crosstalk between immune mediators and neuronal and endocrine functions. Besides, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or agitation are observed in most patients. Here, we studied the psychophysiological response to intrinsic (AD-phenotype) and extrinsic (anxiogenic tests) stress factors and their relation to liver, kidneys, heart, and spleen oxidative status in 18-months-old female gold-standard C57BL/6 mice and 3xTg-AD mice model for AD. The emotional, cognitive, and motor phenotypes were assessed under three different anxiogenic conditions. Survival, frailty index, and immunoendocrine status (corticosterone levels and oxidative stress of peripheral organs) were evaluated. Genotype differences in neuropsychiatric-like profiles and cognitive disfunction in 3xTg-AD females that survived beyond advanced stages of the disease persisted despite losing other behavioral and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) physiological differences. A secondary analysis studied the impact of social isolation, naturally occurring in 3xTg-AD mice due to the death of cage mates. One month of isolation modified hyperactivity and neophobia patterns and disrupt the obsessive-compulsive disorder-like digging ethogram. Frailty index correlated with spleen organometrics in all groups, whereas two AD-specific salient functional correlations were identified: (1) Levels of corticosterone with worse performance in the T-maze, (2) and with a lower splenic GPx antioxidant enzymatic activity, which may suppose a potent risk of morbidity and mortality in AD.

AB  - Aging increases the vulnerability to stress and risk of developing depression. These changes have been related to a reduction of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels, an adrenal steroid with anti stress effects. Also, adult hippocampal neurogenesis decreases during aging and its alteration or impaired is related to the development of depression. Besides, it has been hypothesized that DHEA increases the formation of new neurons. However, it is unknown whether treatment with DHEA in aging may stimulate the dendrite maturation of newborn neurons and reversing depressive-like signs evoked by chronic stress exposure. Here aged male rats (14 months old) were subjected to a scheme of chronic mild stress (CMS) during six weeks, received a treatment with DHEA from the third week of CMS. Changes in body weight and sucrose preference (SP) were measured once a week. DHEA levels were measured in serum, identification of doublecortin-(DCX)-, BrdU- and BrdU/NeuN-labeled cells was done in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. CMS produced a gradual reduction in the body weight, but no changes in the SP were observed. Treatment enhanced levels of DHEA, but lack of recovery on body weight of stressed rats. Aging reduced the number of DCX-, BrdU- and BrdU/NeuN-cells but DHEA just significantly increased the number of DCX-cells in rats under CMS and controls, reaching levels of young non-stressed rats (used here as a reference of an optimal status of health). In rats under CMS, DHEA facilitated dendritic maturation of immature new neurons. Our results reveal that DHEA improves neural plasticity even in conditions of CMS in middle age rats. Thus, this hormone reverted the decrement of DCX-cells caused during normal aging. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to understand links that exist between inherited risk or predisposition, brain and behavioural development, endocrine regulation and social/environmental stimuli, animal models are crucial. The Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat has been shown to have validity as a model of adult and adolescent depression. While sex- and age-specific differences in some of the face, predictive and construct validities of the model such as depression-like behaviours have been established, anhedonia and anxiety using other induced anxiety paradigms such as elevated plus maze remain equivocal. First, post-weaning social isolation effects on inherent and induced anxiety behaviours were tested during two critical time periods, early- and mid-adolescence. Isolation induced immediate effects on novel environment-induced hyperactivity and anxiety-related behaviours. Adolescent WKYs demonstrated reduced 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations suggesting agoraphobia-like behaviours. Second, isolated rats, despite being subsequently social-/group-housed demonstrated longer lasting effects on social interaction measures and anhedonia. This establishes that the depression-like profile observed during early- and mid-adolescence persists into late adolescence and early adulthood in WKY. Further, that interventions at a later stage during adolescence may not be able to reverse early adolescent effects in the context of pre-disposition, thus highlighting the irreversibility of being double-hit during critical time periods of brain and behavioural development and maturation.

AB  - Recent studies showed that freshwater turtles display inter-individual differences in various behavioural traits, which may influence their health and welfare in captivity due to differences in response to husbandry and enrichment strategies and in ability to cope with the limitations of the captive environment. This study investigated a possible correlation between individual level of escape behaviour under standard enrichment conditions and level of interest in coloured objects in a group of cooters Pseudemys sp. and sliders Trachemys scripta ssp. on display at a public aquarium. Interest in different colours, colour preference and individual differences in behavioural changes in the presence of the new enrichment were also studied. Turtles categorised as 'high' and 'moderate escape behaviour' (17-34% of behavioural budget) showed more interest in coloured objects and tended to display less escape behaviour in their presence, while turtles categorised as 'low escape behaviour' (<10% of behavioural budget) were less interested in coloured objects and tended to display more escape behaviour in their presence. Overall, there was more interest in yellow than in red, white or green objects, with more contacts with coloured objects before feeding and at the start of each observation period and a preference for yellow against red objects. The individual differences in behavioural changes in the presence of the new enrichment suggested that more studies into colour preference and response to novelty in turtles would be beneficial to ensure that no individuals are unduly stressed by new enrichments.

AB  - Altered adaptive immunity involving T lymphocytes has been found in depressed patients and in stress-induced depression-like behavior in animal models. Peripheral T cells play important roles in homeostasis and function of the central nervous system and thus modulate behavior. However, the T cell phenotype and function associated with susceptibility and resilience to depression remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized splenic T cells in susceptible and resilient mice after 10 days of social defeat stress (SDS). We found equally decreased T cell frequencies and comparably altered expression levels of genes associated with T helper (Th) cell function in resilient and susceptible mice. Interleukin (IL)-17 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers in the spleen were significantly increased in susceptible mice. These animals further exhibited significantly reduced numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg) and decreased gene expression levels of TGF-(3. Mice with enhanced Th17 differentiation induced by conditional deletion of PPAR'y in ON+ cells (CD4-PPAR-yK), an inhibitor of Th17 development, were equally susceptible to SDS when compared to CD4-PPAR-ywT controls. These data indicate that enhanced Th17 differentiation alone does not alter stress vulnerability. Thus, SDS promotes Th17 cell and suppresses Treg cell differentiation predominantly in susceptible mice with yet unknown effects in immune responses after stress exposure.

AB  - There is increasing societal concern regarding the negative impact of intensive poultry production on animal welfare, human health, and on the environment. This is leading to the inclusion of animal welfare as an imperative aspect for sustainable production. Certain environmental factors may challenge domesticated birds, resulting in poor health and welfare status. Resilience is the capacity to rapidly return to prechallenge status after coping with environmental stressors, thus resilient individuals have better chances to maintain good health and welfare. Immune-neuroendocrine system, thoroughly characterized in the domestic bird species, is the physiological scaffold for stress coping and health maintenance, influencing resilience and linking animal welfare status to these vital responses. Modern domestic bird lines have undergone specific genetic selective pressures for fast-growing, or high eggproduction, leading to a diversity of birds that differ in their coping capacities and resilience. Deepening the knowledge on pro/anti-inflammatory milieus, humoral/ cell-mediated immune responses, hormonal regulations, intestinal microbial communities and mediators that define particular immune and neuroendocrine configurations will shed light on coping strategies at the individual and population level. The understanding of the profiles leading to differential coping and resilience potential will be highly relevant for improving bird health and welfare in a wider range of challenging scenarios and, therefore, crucial to scientifically tackle long term sustainability.

AB  - The captive environment of a laboratory animal can profoundly influence its welfare and the scientific validity of research produced. The African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) is a common model organism, however current husbandry guidelines lack supporting quantitative evidence. The visual environment is a fundamental aspect of a captive animal's housing and may affect a number of physiological and behavioural responses. This is particularly important for species such as X. laevis where cryptic camouflage is a fundamental defence mechanism. Here male (n=16) and female (n = 20) X. laevis were housed in tanks with ecologically relevant (black) and non-relevant (white) background colours and physiological and behavioural responses observed. Higher levels of water-borne corticosterone were observed in tanks with a white background compared to a black background in females (p = 0.047). Increased atypical active behaviours (Swimming: p = 0.042; Walling: p = 0.042) and a greater degree of body mass loss (p < 0.001) were also observed in the white background condition. Together these responses are indicative of increased stress of X. laevis when housed in tanks with a non-ecologically relevant background compared to an ecologically relevant background and suggest refined tank background colour may improve welfare in this species.

AB  - Psychiatric illness, such as affective disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia, exerts exceptional personal burden on affected individuals. Although not physically noticeable, these disorders cost enormously on ones' family and society. Currently pharmaceutical and psychological treatments are generally accepted as effective for psychiatric disorders, while the exact mechanisms underlying the treatment efficacy, etiology and neurobiology of the disorders remain elusive. In the past decade, "neurogenic hypothesis" emerged as an attempt to explain the nature of psychiatric illness. The origination of the hypothesis is based on several pre-clinical and clinical observations. First, stress, which is a common risk factor of the disorders, was found to suppress neurogenesis; second, treatment for the illnesses like antidepressants and antipsychotics were shown to improve neurogenesis and behavioral deficits simultaneously; and third, the therapeutic effect of antidepressants was abolished in animal models when neurogenesis was blocked. Increasing efforts were invested to determine whether neurogenesis is a key to the understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders, although contrasting results are also found and thus the importance of neurogenesis remains a matter of debate. The present chapter will discuss the recent findings about the involvement of neurogenesis in major depression, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia, and whether neurogenesis would be a potential target for development of the treatment in the future.

AB  - Environmental conditions likely affect physiology and behaviour of mice used for life sciences research on Earth or in Space. Here, we analysed the effects of cage confinement on the weightbearing musculoskeletal system, behaviour and stress of wild-type mice (C57BL/6JRj, 30 g b.wt., total n = 24) housed for 25 days in a prototypical ground-based and fully automated life support habitat device called "Mice in Space" (MIS). Compared with control housing (individually ventilated cages) the MIS mice revealed no significant changes in soleus muscle size and myofiber distribution (type I vs. II) and quality of bone (3-D microarchitecture and mineralisation of calvaria, spine and femur) determined by confocal and micro-computed tomography. Corticosterone metabolism measured non-invasively (faeces) monitored elevated adrenocortical activity at only start of the MIS cage confinement (day 1). Behavioural tests (i.e., grip strength, rotarod, L/D box, elevated plus-maze, open field, aggressiveness) performed subsequently revealed only minor changes in motor performance (MIS vs. controls). The MIS habitat will not, on its own, produce major effects that could confound interpretation of data induced by microgravity exposure during spaceflight. Our results may be even more helpful in developing multidisciplinary protocols with adequate scenarios addressing molecular to systems levels using mice of various genetic phenotypes in many laboratories.

AB  - Stereotypic behaviors are repetitive invariant behaviors that are common in many captive species and potentially indicate compromised welfare and suitability as research subjects. Adult laboratory mice commonly perform stereotypic bar-gnawing, route-tracing, and back-flipping, although great individual variation in frequency occurs. Early life factors (for example, level of maternal care received) have lasting effects on CNS functioning and abilities to cope with stress and therefore may also affect stereotypic behavior in offspring. Access to maternal resources and care are influenced by the number of pups in a litter; therefore, we examined both litter size and its potential correlate, weight at weaning, as early environmental predictors of adult stereotypic behavior in laboratory mice. Further, we assessed the effects on offspring stereotypic behavior of delaying the separation of mother and pups (weaning) beyond the standard 21 d of age. Analyzing stereotypic behavior in 3 different mouse colonies composed of 2 inbred strains (C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J) and an outbred stock (CD1[ICR]) revealed significant positive correlation between litter size and stereotypic behavior in female, but not male, mice. Weight and age at weaning did not significantly affect levels of stereotypy in either sex. Litter size therefore may be a useful indicator of individual predisposition to stereotypic behavior in female laboratory mice.

AB  - This study investigated adult rat behaviour in three early life conditions, and how behaviour was affected after exposure to chronic mild stressors in later life. During postnatal days 2-14, male Wistar rats were exposed daily to either long or brief maternal separation, or were left undisturbed with their mothers (non-handled). As adults, non-handled and long maternally separated offspring demonstrated less object exploration than brief maternally separated offspring. Non-handled offspring also showed lower pre-pulse inhibition compared to both long and brief maternally separated offspring. Sucrose preference and open field behaviour as adults did not differ between the early life conditions. Exposure to four weeks of chronic mild stress in adulthood (mimicking daily hassles in humans) increased object exploration, increased pre-pulse inhibition and induced habituation of acoustic startle in non-handled offspring, similar to brief maternally separated offspring. Long maternally separated offspring exposed to chronic mild stress failed to show an increase in object exploration and enhanced pre-pulse inhibition, and did not show habituation of acoustic startle.
   In conclusion, different early life conditions have a different long-term impact on behaviour. Offspring from all three conditions differed from each other in terms of adult behaviour. Mild daily stressors in the adulthood counteracted the effects observed in the non-handled condition. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Entorhinal cortex (EC) has been implicated in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, spreading of neuronal dysfunction within the EC-Hippocampal network has been suggested. We have investigated the time course of EC dysfunction in the AD mouse model carrying human mutation of amyloid precursor protein (mhAPP) expressing human A beta. We found that in mhAPP mice plasticity impairment is first observed in EC superficial layer and further affected with time. A selective impairment of LTP was observed in layer II horizontal connections of EC slices from 2 month old mhAPP mice, whereas at later stage of neurodegeneration (6 month) basal synaptic transmission and LTD were also affected. Accordingly, early synaptic deficit in the mhAPP mice were associated with a selective impairment in EC-dependent associative memory tasks. The introduction of the dominant-negative form of RAGE lacking RAGE signalling targeted to microglia (DNMSR) in mhAPP mice prevented synaptic and behavioural deficit, reducing the activation of stress related kinases (p38MAPK and JNK). Our results support the involvement of the EC in the development and progression of the synaptic and behavioural deficit during amyloid-dependent neurodegeneration and demonstrate that microglial RAGE activation in presence of A beta-enriched environment contributes to the EC vulnerability.

AB  - The presence of negative air ions (NAI) is suggested to be a beneficial factor in improving psychological status and used in treating depression as an alternative approach. However, more biological evidence from animal models is needed to ensure the effects of NAI on the mood regulation, through which can facilitate identification of possible underlying mechanisms. In this study, the chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol was used to induce depressive-like behaviors in mice, and the effects of NAI exposure on CMS-induced depression-like behaviors were examined. Thirty-day NAI exposure prevented the CMS-induced depression-like behaviors as shown by the restoration of sucrose preference and reduced immobility time in the tail suspension test. In addition, the elevation of serous corticosterone was present in CMS-treated mice but not existed in those with the NAI exposure. Furthermore, we observed altered ratios of some cytokines secreted by type 1 T helper (Th1) cells and Th2 cells in CMS-treated mice, but it could be restored after NAI exposure. In conclusion, NAI intervention is able to ameliorate CMS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice, and this effect is associated with the alteration of corticosterone and functional rebalance between Th1 and Th2 cells.

AB  - The generation of new neurons in the adult mammalian brain has led to numerous theories as to their functional significance. One of the most widely held views is that adult neurogenesis promotes pattern separation, a process by which overlapping patterns of neural activation are mapped to less overlapping representations. While a large body of evidence supports a role for neurogenesis in high interference memory tasks, it does not support the proposed function of neurogenesis in mediating pattern separation. Instead, the adult-generated neurons seem to generate highly overlapping and yet distinct distributed representations for similar events. One way in which these immature, highly plastic, hyperactive neurons may contribute to novel memory formation while avoiding interference is by virtue of their extremely sparse connectivity with incoming perforant path fibers. Another intriguing proposal, awaiting empirical confirmation, is that the young neurons' recruitment into memory formation is gated by a novelty/mismatch mechanism mediated by CA3 or hilar back-projections. Ongoing research into the intriguing link between neurogenesis, stress-related mood disorders, and age-related neurodegeneration may lead to promising neurogenesis-based treatments for this wide range of clinical disorders.

AB  - An animal's emotional responses are the result of its cognitive appraisal of a situation. This appraisal is notably influenced by the possibility of an individual to exert control over an aversive event. Although the fact that environment controllability decreases emotional responses in animals is well established, far less is known about its potential trans-generational effects. As the levels of avian yolk hormones can vary according to the mother's environment, we hypothesized that housing environment of mothers would modulate the quality of her eggs and in turn her offspring's behaviour. Two groups of female japanese quail were constituted: a group that had access to a place to hide in their home-cage (Hd, n = 20) and a group that had nowhere to hide (NoHd, n = 20) when stressed. Both groups were submitted to daily human disturbances for a twenty-day-period. Hd females produced eggs with both less testosterone and androstenedione than did NoHd females. The emotional and social reactivity of Hd female's offspring were lower and their growth wes slower than those of NoHd females' offspring. Our results show that a minor difference in housing environment had substantial effects on eggs and offspring. The presence of a shelter probably helped quail to cope with daily human disturbances, producing less reactive offspring. This transgenerational effect caused by an opportunity to hide could lead to applications in care of laboratory animals, conservation biology and animal welfare.

AB  - Decreased interest in pleasurable stimuli including social withdrawal and reduced libido are some of the key symptomatic criteria for major depression, and thus assays that measure social and sexual behavior in rodents may be highly appropriate for modeling depressive states. Here we present a novel approach for validating rodent models of depression by assessing male urine scent marking (USM) made in consequence to a spot of urine from a proestrous female. USM is an ethologically important form of sexual communication expressed by males to attract females. The expression of this behavior is highly sensitive and adaptive to environmental cues and social status. We hypothesized that male USM behavior offers a naturalistic measure of social motivation that can be used to evaluate hedonic behaviors relevant to the study of mood disorders. We demonstrated that 1) adult male mice displayed a strong preference for marking proestrous female urine with a high degree of specificity, 2) exposure to chronic social defeat profoundly decreased USM whereas exposure to environmental enrichment increased USM, 3) the standard antidepressant fluoxetine reversed declines in USM induced by social defeat, 4) USM behavior closely correlated with other hedonic measures, and 5) USM scores in non-stressed mice predicted behavioral outcomes after defeat exposure such that mice displaying high preference for marking female urine prior to social defeat showed behavioral resiliency after social defeat. The findings indicate that the USM test is a sensitive, validated measure of psychosocial stress effects that has high predictive value for examination of stress resiliency and vulnerability and their neurobiological substrates.

AB  - Current trends in neuroscience research have moved toward a reliance on rodent animal models to study most aspects of brain function. Such laboratory-reared animals are highly inbred, have been disengaged from their natural environments for generations and appear to be of limited predictive value for successful clinical outcomes. In this Perspective article, we argue that research on a rich diversity of animal model systems is fundamental to new discoveries in evolutionarily conserved core physiological and molecular mechanisms that are the foundation of human brain function. Analysis of neural circuits across phyla will reveal general computational solutions that form the basis for adaptive behavioral responses. Further, we stress that development of ethoexperimental approaches to improve our understanding of behavioral nuance will help to realign our research strategies with therapeutic goals and improve the translational validity of specific animal models. Finally, we suggest that neuroscience has a role in environmental conservation of habitat and fauna that will preserve and protect the ecological settings that drive species-specific behavioral adaptations. A rich biodiversity will enhance our understanding of human brain function and lead in unpredicted directions for development of therapeutic treatments for neurological disorders.

AB  - Rats are widely used animal models for biological psychiatry and neuroscience. Laboratory rats are typically housed in impoverished sensory environments. The lack of species-typical sensory environment might radically change the response of individual animals to stressful and/or threatening episodes. In this report, we demonstrate that behavioral and neural sequelae of chronic stress were modified by sensory environment of adult male rats. This includes effects of stress on the density of spines on CA3 hippocampal neurons, hippocampal neurogenesis and abundance of glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors. Enrichment also reduced depression-like behavior in a forced swim task. Stress and sensory enrichment evoked opposing effects on all the above endpoints. The sensory enrichment used in this report is of a relatively short duration provided during adulthood. This period excludes critical windows of greater plasticity during pre- and peripubertal stages. Our results suggest that standard housing practices for laboratory rats remain austere concerning sensory requirements of this species. Thus, even a moderate sensory enrichment is capable of reducing high stress-sensitivity and depressive-like behavior in standard laboratory rats. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Adverse stress effects on the hippocampal memory system are generally thought to be due to the high level of circulating glucocorticoids directly modifying the properties of hippocampal neurons and, accordingly, the results should be reproducible with exogenous administration of cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. However, glucocorticoid levels increased to other events, such as exercise and environment enrichment, do not impair but instead enhance hippocampal memory, indicating that cortisol/corticosterone are not invariant causal factors of stress. To better model the complex psychophysiological attributes of stress (i.e., aversiveness, lack of controllability, and glucose metabolism), we examined the functions of the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and corticosterone on a hippocampal-based one-trial novel object recognition (OR) memory task in rats. Specifically, animals were subjected to amygdala stimulation, mPFC inactivation, and corticosterone treatments separately or in combination during behavioral testing. Collective amygdala, mPFC, and corticosterone manipulations significantly impaired OR memory comparable to behavioral stress. By contrast, single and dual treatments failed to reliably decrease memory functioning. These results suggest that negative mnemonic impacts of uncontrollable stress involve the amalgamation of heightened amygdala and diminished mPFC activities, and elevated circulating corticosterone level.

AB  - In groups of four same-sexed animals, PVG/c hooded rats were housed for 4.5 months in standard or enriched cages containing several objects that could be explored and manipulated. On separate occasions, each rat then experienced two consecutive daily trials in an open field, a light-dark box or a Y maze with arm inserts that enabled an acquisition trial comprising one black and one white arm to be changed for a retention trial consisting of two black arms. Before their trials in the open field and light-dark box, and following each acquisition trial in the Y maze, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg scopolamine or isotonic saline. In the open field, enrichment led to higher levels of ambulation, walking, rearing and occupancy of the center of the apparatus and shorter emergence latencies from the dark into the light compartment of the light-dark box accompanied by more entries of this compartment. Enrichment also increased entries of and time spent in the changed (or novel) Y-maze arm only for male rats treated with scopolamine. The drug decreased rearing and increased grooming in the open field as well as increasing emergence latencies and decreasing entries of and the time spent on the light compartment of the light-dark box. The main results were interpreted as enrichment having attenuated anxiogenic effects of the behavioral testing and the action of scopolamine for male (but not female) rats in their choices of the novel arm in the Y maze.

AB  - While increasing evidence demonstrates that physical exercise promotes brain health, little is known on how the reduction of physical activity affects brain function. We investigated whether the cessation of wheel running alters anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors and its impact on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice (4 weeks old) were assigned to one of the following groups, and housed until 21 weeks old; (1) no exercise control (noEx), housed in a standard cage; (2) exercise (Ex), housed in a running wheel cage; and (3) exercise-no exercise (Ex-noEx), housed in a running wheel cage for 8 weeks and subsequently in a standard cage. Behavioral evaluations suggested that Ex-noEx mice were more anxious compared to noEx control mice, but no differences were found in depression-like behavior. The number of BrdU-labeled surviving cells in the dentate gyrus was significantly higher in Ex but not in Ex-noEx compared with noEx, indicating that the facilitative effects of exercise on cell survival are reversible. Surprisingly, the ratio of differentiation of BrdU-positive cells to doublecortin-positive immature neurons was significantly lower in Ex-noEx compared to the other groups, suggesting that the cessation of wheel running impairs an important component of hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. These results indicate that hippocampal adaptation to physical inactivity is not simply a return to the conditions present in sedentary mice. As the impaired neurogenesis is predicted to increase a vulnerability to stress-induced mood disorders, the reduction of physical activity may contribute to a greater risk of these disorders.

AB  - Some environmental interventions can result in physiologic and behavioral changes in laboratory animals. In this context, the handling of adolescent or adult rodents has been reported to influence exploratory behavior and emotionality. Here we examined the effects of handling on memory and anxiety levels of adolescent rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (age, 60 d) were divided into a control group and a handled group, which were handled for 5 min daily, 5 d per week, for 6 wk. During handling bouts, the rat was removed from its cage, placed in the experimenter's lap or on the top of a table, and had its neck and back gently stroked by the experimenter's fingers. During week 6, each rat's anxiety level was evaluated in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. Learning and memory were evaluated 48 h later, by measuring escape latency in the elevated plus-maze test. Plasma corticosterone and catecholamine levels were measured also. Norepinephrine levels were lower in the handled rats compared with control animals, with no differences in epinephrine and corticosterone. As compared with the control rats, the handled rats showed increases in the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the test apparatus, percentage of entries into open arms, and number of visits to the end of the open arms and decreases in the latency of the first open arm entry. Escape latency was lower in the handled rats compared with control rats in both the first and second trials. The data obtained suggest that handling decreases anxiety levels and improves learning skills and memory in rats.

AB  - It is widely recognised that single housing is detrimental to the welfare of social species. However, some experimental procedures dictate that laboratory animals are housed individually. There is evidence to suggest that, by mimicking social contact, mirrors are beneficial to the welfare of singly housed horses and heifers. However, experiments with singly caged laboratory mice have found mirrors to be mildly aversive. The present study investigated the behavioural response of singly housed male and female rabbits to a mirror in their cage. After a period of pre-trial behavioural observations, rabbits were provided with an acrylic mirror, either at the front or the back of their cage, for a period of seven days. This was followed by a post-trial period, at the beginning of which all mirrors were removed. Both sexes showed some changes in behaviour and in the use of space within the cage. The addition of a mirror significantly reduced grooming in females, which was previously considered to be at high levels. Both males and females showed an increase in investigatory behaviour, although the patterns of change differed between the sexes. Differences between males and females are attributed to differences in socio-sexual strategies between the sexes. It is concluded that, when single housing is unavoidable, mirrors might be appropriate to partially compensate for social contact in female laboratory rabbits. Further research using a wide range of welfare indicators is needed to establish whether the provision of a mirror could be used as a successful method of improving laboratory rabbit welfare.

AB  - Outbred rat lines such as Wistar rats are commonly used for models of depressive disorders. Such rats arise from random mating schedules. Hence, genetic drift occurs in outbred populations which could lead to genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity between rats from different vendors. Additionally, vendor specific rearing conditions could contribute to intrastrain variability. In the present study differences in behavioral responses to the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression within Wistar rat strains from different vendors are described. DNA methylation studies and mRNA expression analysis of p11 revealed that the behavioral differences between the substrains are reflected at the epigenetic and genetic level. The results suggest that there are breeder-dependent differences in vulnerability to stress in the CMS model of depression, which might bear on the validity of the model and contribute to contradictory findings and difficulties of replication between laboratories. P11 mRNA expression seems to be differently regulated depending on the quality of the stress response evoked by CMS exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Methylphenidate (MPH) is a stimulant prescribed to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Its primary mechanism of action is in the dopamine system, alterations of which are associated with vulnerability to alcohol abuse. There are concerns that juvenile MPH treatment may influence adult drinking behavior. This study examined the interaction of MPH treatment and environmental rearing conditions, which are known to independently influence ethanol (EtOH) drinking behavior, on anxiety-like behavior and vulnerability to alcohol abuse in a juvenile rodent model.
   Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in enriched, standard, or isolated conditions for 4 weeks, starting at postnatal day 21. Rats were concurrently treated with 8 mg/kg/d MPH or saline, delivered via osmotic minipump. Anxiety-like behavior was determined at the end of the treatment session, and 5 weeks later. After MPH treatment, rats were exposed to a 2-bottle choice EtOH drinking procedure that lasted 3 weeks.
   Results: Early life chronic MPH treatment was associated with greater EtOH intake and greater EtOH preference, but only in socially isolated animals. Isolated animals had greater levels of anxiety-like behavior than standard-housed or enriched animals after 4 weeks of exposure to the housing conditions, a difference that persisted even after all animals had been individually housed for an additional 5 weeks and exposed to EtOH.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that early life MPH treatment may increase vulnerability to EtOH drinking in adulthood in a subset of the population. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of early rearing condition for establishing long-lasting behavioral phenotypes. Environmental histories should be considered when prescribing MPH treatment to young children.

AB  - If fearfulness is stable, consistent and trait-like, then valid measures of fearfulness should be stable, consistent and independent of influences unrelated to fear. We assessed the validity of six fear measures using Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, a common species in fear research. Measures were made during emergence, novel object, novel food and predator surprise tests. These were considered to have internal validity if they were stable over 18 days, when we controlled for nonexperimental variables including season of testing and cage location. We determined convergent and discriminant validity by factor analysis of fear measures plus measures of sociality, activity level and repetitive behaviour. Fear measures with good convergent validity showed agreement in their factor loadings. Those with good discriminant validity loaded on to different factors from nonfear measures. Most of the fear measures examined were moderately stable over time, but only half had good discriminant validity. Convergence was good among measures from the same test but poor across tests. Measures from each fear test loaded separately. Overall, flight distance and freezing duration in the predator surprise test and amount eaten in the novel food test showed the best internal, convergent and discriminant validity. When we considered only these three measures, convergence remained higher among measures from the same test than from different tests. Fearfulness thus appeared somewhat unstable over time and inconsistent across situations, which, if true across species, greatly limits the utility of fear tests.

AB  - Human visitors affect the behavior of captive animals, which is the so-called visitor effect. The number and behavior of visitors may influence stress-related behaviors in captive animals, such as self-scratching, yawning, and visitor-directed vigilance. A social group setting can be applied to alleviate such negative visitor effects and facilitate social behavior and interactions between individuals. In this study, we examined how the number and behavior of visitors are related to stress-related behaviors of a captive mixed-species gibbon pair comprising a yellow-cheek gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae) and a white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar). The two gibbons were separated during the study period, and we examined whether the social isolation stimulated the visitor effect. The frequency of stress-related behaviors of the gibbons increased and the social playing between them decreased proportionally to visitor number. In the indoor enclosure, the gibbons increased their visitor-directed vigilance when visitors shouted or struck the glass partition. Our findings indicate that the number and behavior of visitors negatively affect captive gibbons and that a mixed-species social setting can help gibbons reduce visitor-induced stress. Future studies with larger sample sizes will improve the understanding of the visitor effect and the social setting in the captivity.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntington disease gene. The symptomatic stage of the disease is defined by the onset of motor symptoms. However, psychiatric disturbances, including depression, are common features of HD and can occur a decade before the manifestation of motor symptoms. We used the YAC128 transgenic mice (which develop motor deficits at a later stage, allowing more time to study depressive behaviors without the confounding effects of motor impairment) to test the effects of intranasal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment for 15 days in the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors. Using multiple well-validated behavioral tests, we found that BDNF treatment alleviated anhedonic and depressive-like behaviors in the YAC128 HD mice. Furthermore, we also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effects of BDNF were associated with an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, BDNF treatment only increased cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of wild-type (WT) mice, without altering these parameters in their YAC128 counterparts. Moreover, BDNF treatment did not cause an increase in the number of dendritic branches in the hippocampal DG when compared with animals treated with vehicle. In conclusion, our results suggest that non-invasive administration of BDNF via the intranasal route may have important therapeutic potential for treating mood disturbances in early-symptomatic HD patients.

AB  - The present study evaluated the long-lasting effects of neonatal handling (NH; administered during the first 21 days of life) on unlearned and learned anxiety-related responses in inbred Roman High- (RHA-I) and Low-avoidance (RLA-I) rats. To this aim, untreated and neonatally-handled RHA-I and RLA-I rats of both sexes were tested in the following tests/tasks: a novel object exploration (NOE) test, the elevated zero maze (ZM) test, a "baseline acoustic startle" (BAS) test, a "context-conditioned fear" (CCF) test and the acquisition of two-way active shuttle box avoidance (SHAV). RLA-I rats showed higher unconditioned (novel object exploration test -"NOE"-, elevated zero maze test -"ZM"-, BAS), and conditioned (CCF, SHAV) anxiety. NH increased exploration of the novel object in the NOE test as well as exploration of the open sections of the ZM test in both rat strains and sexes, although the effects were relatively more marked in the (high anxious) RLA-I strain and in females. NH did not affect BAS, but reduced CCF in both strains and sexes, and improved shuttle box avoidance acquisition especially in RLA-I (and particularly in females) and in female RHA-I rats. These are completely novel findings, which indicate that even some genetically-based anxiety/fear-related phenotypes can be significantly modulated by previous environmental experiences such as the NH manipulation.

AB  - Animal shelters rescue and care for society's unwanted companion animals. Nonetheless, several studies have shown that ending up in a shelter can be stressful, and that shelter husbandry can amplify and spread certain diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate and describe husbandry policy, practices and routines as well as occurrence and prevention of diseases in Swedish cat shelters. A survey was sent to 64 potential shelters of which 39 (61%) responded. Thirty-two shelters (82%) housed cats (Felis silvestris catus) in groups; one shelter provided only solitary housing. Thirty-one shelters provided single, pair and group housing. The most common group size was 3-5 cats (59%). Ninety-two percent of responding shelters had routines and/or protocol(s) for the management of the cats, 35 had healthcare routines and 30 shelters had routines for the admission of cats. All shelters with the exception of one had quarantine, and 22 shelters (58%) vaccinated cats prior to admittance. There was a significant positive correlation between shelter size and number of reported diseases. The most common reported disease was cat 'flu/cold, although altogether, shelters reported a low occurrence of disease. Practices differ between shelters relating to management, eg use of quarantine and vaccination routines. In Sweden, group housing is common and shelters provide cats with plenty of resources, eg hides and climbing structures, often providing outdoor access and a more 'home-like' environment. The possibility that providing a more 'enriched home-like' environment can help cats cope with the shelter environment is discussed, thereby decreasing the occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases.

AB  - During weaning, piglets experience concurrent social, physical, and nutritional stressors. Consequently, piglets often have poor feed intake and display increased oral manipulative behaviours post-weaning, indicative of compromised welfare. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) possess many attractive properties for pigs and could therefore function as effective edible enrichment, potentially alleviating weaning stress by facilitating exploration and promoting feed intake. In this study, pairs of piglets received a small amount of either live BSFL or wood shavings (8 pens/treatment) scattered throughout the pen twice a day for 11 days after weaning. Home-pen behaviour was scored by instantaneous scan sampling on day 2, 5 and 8, and behavioural responses to a novel environment and novel object were scored on day 10/11. Performance-related parameters were observed regularly. Larvae provisioning increased floor-directed exploration and decreased object-directed exploration, pig-directed oral manipulation, fighting and eating of pellets, and reduced neophobia towards a novel object. Pellet intake was significantly decreased by BSFL provisioning during day 4-11 post-weaning, although feed and net energy intake including BSFL never differed between treatments. BSFL provisioning did not influence piglet growth, feed efficiency, energy efficiency, and faecal consistency. To conclude, live BSFL provisioning positively affected post-weaning piglet behaviour while maintaining performance.

AB  - Research in a number of livestock industries has shown that interactions between stockpeople and their animals can limit the productivity and welfare of these animals. While many of these interactions are routinely and, at times, habitually used by stockpeople, the frequent use of some of these routine behaviours can result in farm animals becoming highly fearful of humans. It is these high fear levels, through stress, that appear to limit animal productivity and welfare. This research has also shown that an important antecedent of stockperson behaviour is the attitude of the stockperson towards interacting with his or her farm animals. Intervention studies in the dairy and pig industries have shown the potential of cognitive-behavioural intervention techniques designed to specifically target those attitudes and behaviours of stockpeople that have a direct effect on animal fear, welfare and productivity.
   It is recommended that such cognitive-behavioural training programs for stockpeople are introduced in the livestock industries. Selection tools targeting the important human characteristics that affect work performance may also be valuable not only to select stockpeople but also to identify experienced and inexperienced stockpeople that require training. More extensive research is also required to identify the full range of stockperson interactions that have implication for farm animals. In addition to identifying the aversive elements of handling, the rewarding elements of human-animal interactions for animals should be identified and the opportunities to utilise these rewarding elements to alleviate some of the aversive interactions, that are at times necessary in livestock production, should be explored.

AB  - The use of music as enrichment has rarely been explored in zoos, despite evidence that music has a positive effect on a range of laboratory housed animals. In this study of moloch gibbons, Hylobates moloch, at Howletts Wild Animal Park (Kent, England), instrumental classical music was played to eight individuals in two family groups. Music was played 7hr a day during three of six study weeks for each group, alternating with control weeks in which no music was played. In focal watches, data were recorded on a measure of activity, brachiation, and on two rates of affiliative behavior, giving and receiving grooming. In addition, to assess potential impacts on emotional state, data were recorded on self-scratching and self-grooming, two widely used indices of anxiety or stress. Analyses were carried out for each individual separately, as previous studies of primates indicate animals may differ in their response to enrichment. Results revealed little evidence for effects of music on gibbons' behavior. During the music compared to control weeks, the adult male from one group showed higher rates of self-scratching and higher durations of both self-grooming and grooming others. The adult female from the same group was groomed more during the music weeks than control weeks. For the six other animals, no significant differences in behaviors were seen between music and control conditions. Our findings suggest music may not be an effective enrichment for captive gibbons, and further highlight the importance of considering individual differences when assessing the effects of potential enrichment.

AB  - Unlike many other neurodegenerative diseases with established gene-environment interactions, Huntington's disease (HD) is viewed as a disorder governed by genetics. The cause of the disease is a highly penetrant tandem repeat expansion encoding an extended polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. In the year 2000, a pioneering study showed that the disease could be delayed in transgenic mice by enriched housing conditions. This review describes subsequent human and preclinical studies identifying environmental modulation of motor, cognitive, affective and other symptoms found in HD. Alongside the behavioral observations we also discuss potential mechanisms and the relevance to other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In mouse models of HD, increased sensorimotor and cognitive stimulation can delay or ameliorate various endophenotypes. Potential mechanisms include increased trophic support, synaptic plasticity, adult neurogenesis, and other forms of experience-dependent cellular plasticity. Subsequent clinical investigations support a role for lifetime activity levels in modulating the onset and progression of HD. Stress can accelerate memory and olfactory deficits and exacerbate cellular dysfunctions in HD mice. In the absence of effective treatments to slow the course of HD, environmental interventions offer feasible approaches to delay the disease, however further preclinical and human studies are needed in order to generate clinical recommendations. Environmental interventions could be combined with future pharmacological therapies and stimulate the identification of enviromimetics, drugs which mimic or enhance the beneficial effects of cognitive stimulation and physical activity.

AB  - Early environmental experience produces profound neural and behavioural effects. F or example, animals reared in isolation show increased anxiety, neophobia, and poorer performance in teaming and spatial memory tasks. We investigated whether later enrichment reverses some oral I of the deficits induced by isolation rearing. Eighty-four male Long-Evans rats (21 days old) were reared under different conditions: enriched (group housed with toys), isolated (one rat/cage), standard (two rats/cage), isolated-enriched, enriched-isolated, isolated-standard, or enriched-standard. In the latter four conditions, animals were housed in the first environment until adolescence (66 days). Following the 90-day rearing period, all animals were assessed in a battery of behavioural tests and cortical thickness was measured postmortem. Isolation rearing led to significant differences in behavioural tests measuring anxiety, spatial teaming, and locomotor activity; switching the rearing condition partially reversed these changes. Rearing condition did not affect pain thresholds in the tail flick test or aversive associative learning in the conditioned taste aversion test. Enriched rats had the thickest cortex; isolated rats the thinnest. None of the switch groups differed significantly from standard-reared rats in this measure. Taken together, these results provide novel and interesting information regarding the effects of pre- or post-adolescent enrichment experience on behavioural and neural expression of the social isolation syndrome.

AB  - The stress caused by sound is inevitable. The stress caused by noise and the positive ef-fects of music can affect the endocrine of animals and their welfare. In this study, a total of 72 hybrid piglets (Large White x Duroc x Min pig) were randomly divided into 3 groups, including music (Mozart K.448, 60-70 dB), noise (recorded mechanical noise, 80-85 dB), and control (natural background sound, < 40 dB) groups. S-IgA (secretory immunoglobulin A), IL-6 (interleukin-6), IL-8 (interleukin-8), and positive emotion-related behaviors were used as indicators to discuss whether noise induced stress and inflammation in piglets or whether music could have positive effects. Six hours of auditory exposure were given daily (10:0 0-16:0 0), which lasted for 56 days. Behavioral responses of the piglets were observed, and the concentrations of salivary S-IgA and serum IL-6 and IL-8 were measured. The re-sults showed that the concentration of S-IgA increased in the noise and control groups on the 57th day ( P < 0.05); S-IgA concentration in the music group was unchanged after long-term music exposure. The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 showed that long-term noise ex-posure might lead to stress and inflammation in piglets. Tail-wagging and play behaviors of the piglets in the music group were significantly greater than those in the noise and con-trol groups, which implied that long-term music exposure improved the emotional state of the piglets in a restricted and barren environment.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Throughout adulthood, the dentate gyrus continues to produce new granule cells, which integrate into the hippocannpal circuitry. New neurons have been linked to several known functions of the hippocampus, including learning and memory, anxiety and stress regulation, and social behavior. We explored whether transgenic reduction of adult-born neurons in mice would impair social memory and the formation of social dominance hierarchies. We used a conditional transgenic mouse strain [thynnidine kinase (TK) mice] that selectively reduces adult neurogenesis by treatment with the antiviral drug valganciclovir (VGCV). TK mice treated with VGCV were unable to recognize conspecifics as familiar 24 h after initial exposure. We then explored whether reducing new neurons completely impaired their ability to acquire or retrieve a social memory and found that TK mice treated with VGCV were able to perform at control levels when the time between exposure (acquisition) and reexposure (retrieval) was brief. We next explored whether adult-born neurons are involved in dominance hierarchy formation by analyzing their home cage behavior as well as their performance in the tube test, a social hierarchy test, and did not find any consistent alterations in behavior between control and TK mice treated with VGCV. These data suggest that adult neurogenesis is essential for social memory maintenance, but not for acquisition nor retrieval over a short time frame, with no effect on social dominance hierarchy. Future work is needed to explore whether the influence of new neurons on social memory is mediated through connections with the CA2, an area involved in social recognition.

AB  - Early life adversity (ELA) increases risk for negative health outcomes, with sex disparities in prevalence and form of ELA experienced and risk for neuropsychiatric pathology. ELA comes in many forms (e.g. parental neglect/loss, limited access to resources) but whether disparate forms of ELA have common effects on outcomes, and if males and females are equally affected, remains unknown. Epidemiological studies often fail to accurately account for differences in type, timing, and duration of adversity experienced. Rodent models allow precise control of many of these variables. However, differences in the form of ELA, species, strain, housing, and testing paradigms used may contribute to differences in outcomes leading to questions of whether differences are the result of the form of ELA or these other variables. Here, we directly compared two mouse models of ELA, maternal separation (MS) and limited bedding (LB) in males and females on development of the body, motor and visual milestones, stress physiology, and anxiety-like behavior. LB affected timing of early milestones, somatic growth, and stress physiology in both sexes, yet only females showed later anxiety-like behaviors. MS rearing affected males and females similarly in early milestone development, yet only males showed changes in stress physiology and anxiety-like outcomes. These studies provide a platform to directly compare MS and LB models within one lab. The current work advances our understanding of the unique features of ELA that shape early neurodevelopmental events and risk for later pathology, increasing the translational relevance of these ELA models.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is suppressed by high-fat (HF) diet and metabolic disease, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Deficits in AHN may contribute to cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia and mood disorders, which have higher prevalence in women. However, sex differences in the effects of HF diet/metabolic disease on AHN have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Herein, male and female C57BU6J mice were fed an HF or control (CON) diet from similar to 2 to 6 months of age. After 3 months on the diet, mice were injected with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) then killed 4 weeks later. Cell proliferation, differentiation/maturation, and survival of new neurons in the dentate gyrus were assessed with immunofluorescence for EdU, Ki67, doublecortin (DCX), and NeuN. CON females had more proliferating cells (Ki67(+)) and neuroblasts/immature neurons (DCX+) compared with CON males; however, HF diet reduced these cells in females to the levels of males. Diet did not affect neurogenesis in males. Further, the numbers of proliferating cells and immature neurons were inversely correlated with both weight gain and glucose intolerance in females only. These effects were robust in the dorsal hippocampus, which supports cognitive processes. Assessment of microglia in the dentate gyrus using immunofluorescence for lba1 and CD68 uncovered sex-specific effects of diet, which may contribute to observed differences in neurogenesis. These findings demonstrate sex-specific effects of HF diet/metabolic disease on AHN, and highlight the potential for targeting neurogenic deficits to treat cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia associated with these conditions, particularly in females.

AB  - Negative affect in humans and animals is known to cause individuals to interpret ambiguous stimuli pessimistically, a phenomenon termed 'cognitive bias'. Here, we used captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to test the hypothesis that a reduction in environmental conditions, from enriched to non-enriched cages, would engender negative affect, and hence 'pessimistic' biases. We also explored whether individual differences in stereotypic behaviour (repetitive somersaulting) predicted 'pessimism'. Eight birds were trained on a novel conditional discrimination task with differential rewards, in which background shade (light or dark) determined which of two covered dishes contained a food reward. The reward was small when the background was light, but large when the background was dark. We then presented background shades intermediate between those trained to assess the birds' bias to choose the dish associated with the smaller food reward (a 'pessimistic' judgement) when the discriminative stimulus was ambiguous. Contrary to predictions, changes in the level of cage enrichment had no effect on 'pessimism'. However, changes in the latency to choose and probability of expressing a choice suggested that birds learnt rapidly that trials with ambiguous stimuli were unreinforced. Individual differences in performance of stereotypies did predict 'pessimism'. Specifically, birds that somersaulted were more likely to choose the dish associated with the smaller food reward in the presence of the most ambiguous discriminative stimulus. We propose that somersaulting is part of a wider suite of behavioural traits indicative of a stress response to captive conditions that is symptomatic of a negative affective state.

AB  - The measurement of 'cognitive bias' has recently emerged as a powerful tool for assessing animal welfare. Cognitive bias was initially, and widely, studied in humans, and describes the way in which particular emotions are associated with biases in information processing. People suffering from clinical levels of anxiety or depression, for example, interpret ambiguous events more negatively than do non-anxious or non-depressed people. Development of methods for use with non-human animals has revealed similar biases in several species of mammals and birds, and one invertebrate. However, cognitive bias has not been previously explored in any species of non-human primate, despite specific concerns raised about the welfare of these animals in captivity. Here, we describe a touchscreen-based cognitive-bias task developed for use with captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Monkeys were initially trained on a 'Go/No-Go' operant task, in which they learned to touch one of two lines that differed in size in order to receive a reward (food), and to desist from touching the other line to avoid a mildly aversive stimulus (delay to the next trial and white noise). In testing sessions, the monkeys were presented with lines of intermediate size. We measured whether touchscreen responses to these ambiguous stimuli were affected by husbandry procedures (environmental enrichment, and a statutory health check involving restraint and ketamine hydrochloride injection) presumed to induce positive and negative shifts in affective state, respectively. Monkeys made fewer responses to ambiguous stimuli post health check compared to during the phase of enrichment suggesting greater expectation of negative outcomes following the health check compared to during enrichment. Shifts in affective state following standard husbandry procedures may therefore be associated with changes in information processing similar to those demonstrated in anxious and depressed humans, and in a number of other taxa.

AB  - Some, but not all studies in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), report reduced hippocampus (HPC) volume. In particular it is unclear, whether smaller hippocampal volume represents a susceptibility factor for PTSD rather than a consequence of the trauma. To gain insight into the relationship of brain morphology and trauma exposure, we investigated volumetric and molecular changes of the HPC in a mouse model of PTSD by means of in vivo Manganese Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI) and ex vivo ultramicroscopic measurements. Exposure to a brief inescapable foot shock led to a volume reduction in both left HPC and right central amygdala two months later. This volume loss was mirrored by a down-regulation of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) in the HPC. Enriched housing decreased the intensity of trauma-associated contextual fear, independently of whether it was provided before or after the shock. Beyond that, enriched housing led to an increase in intracranial volume, including the lateral ventricles and the hippocampus, and to an up-regulation of GAP43 as revealed by MEMRI and Western blot analysis, thus partially compensating for trauma-related HPC volume loss and down-regulation of GAP43 expression. Together these data demonstrate that traumatic experience in mice causes a reduction in HPC and central amygdala volume possibly due to a shrinkage of axonal protrusions. Enriched housing might induce trophic changes, which may contribute to the amelioration of trauma-associated PTSD-like symptoms at behavioural, morphological and molecular levels.

AB  - This review discusses the long-term effects of early-life environment on epileptogenesis, epilepsy, and neuro-psychiatric comorbidities with an emphasis on the absence epilepsy. The WAG/Rij rat strain is a well-validated genetic model of absence epilepsy with mild depression-like (dysthymia) comorbidity. Although pathologic phenotype in WAG/Rij rats is genetically determined, convincing evidence presented in this review suggests that the absence epilepsy and depression-like comorbidity in WAG/Rij rats may be governed by early-life events, such as prenatal drug exposure, early-life stress, neonatal maternal separation, neonatal handling, maternal care, environmental enrichment, neonatal sensory impairments, neonatal tactile stimulation, and maternal diet. The data, as presented here, indicate that some early environmental events can promote and accelerate the devel-opment of absence seizures and their neuropsychiatric comorbidities, while others may exert anti-epileptogenic and disease-modifying effects. The early environment can lead to phenotypic alterations in offspring due to epigenetic modifications of gene expression, which may have maladaptive consequences or represent a thera-peutic value. Targeting DNA methylation with a maternal methyl-enriched diet during the perinatal period appears to be a new preventive epigenetic anti-absence therapy. A number of caveats related to the maternal methyl-enriched diet and prospects for future research are discussed.

AB  - Currently, the mouse represents the preferred model organism among mammals used for animal studies. Due to a great availability of mutant strains it represents a standard method to analyze in vivo the effects of targeted gene manipulations. While this - at least in theory - represents a valuable tool to elucidate the pathophysiology of certain human diseases, there are several caveats which need to be considered working with animals.
   In our study we aimed at elucidating, how a widely established breeding strategy, i.e. the use of "foster mothers" to save the survival of compromised mouse pups for ongoing experiments, per se, affects the emotional phenotype of the fostered offspring. Since it is a popular method to use outbred strains like NMRI to do this job, we sought to evaluate the potential effects of such an artificial postnatal condition and compare either offspring nurtured by their biological mothers or two different strains of foster mothers. Hence we analysed changes in maternal care and later on the emotional behaviour of male and female C57BL/6 mice reared by (i) their biological C57BL/6 mothers, (ii) C57BL/6 foster mothers and (iii) NMRI foster mothers in a behavioural test battery. In addition we assessed corticosterone levels as indicator for stress-physiological changes.
   Besides clear differences in maternal behaviour, our study indicates an altered emotional state (i.e. differences in anxiety and depressive-like features) in mice reared by different "categories" of mothers, which emphasizes the importance to embed such perinatal conditions in the evaluation of animal-deriving data.

AB  - According to current guidelines on animal experiments, a prospective assessment of the severity of each procedure is mandatory. However, so far, the classification of procedures into different severity categories mainly relies on theoretic considerations, since it is not entirely clear which of the various procedures compromise the welfare of animals, or, to what extent. Against this background, a systematic empirical investigation of the impact of each procedure, including behavioral testing, seems essential. Therefore, the present study was designed to elucidate the effects of repeated versus single testing on mouse welfare, using one of the most commonly used paradigms for behavioral phenotyping in behavioral neuroscience, the open-field test. In an independent groups design, laboratory mice (Mus muscu/us f. domestica) experienced either repeated, single, or no open-field testing procedures that are assigned to different severity categories. Interestingly, testing experiences did not affect fecal corticosterone metabolites, body weights, elevated plus-maze or home cage behavior differentially. Thus, with respect to the assessed endocrinological, physical, and behavioral outcome measures, no signs of compromised welfare could be detected in mice that were tested in the open-field repeatedly, once, or, not at all. These findings challenge current classification guidelines and may, furthermore, stimulate systematic research on the severity of single procedures involving living animals

AB  - In the evaluation of animal welfare under practical husbandry conditions - beside a clear definition of welfare - selection of indicators plays an important role. Using the example of fattening pig husbandry, the usefulness of physiological, immunological and pathological, ethological, and technical criteria of husbandry conditions is discussed. While physiological and immunological parameters can lead to findings about stress reactions under controlled circumstances their direct transfer to practical conditions is hardly possible. On the contrary, ethological indicators as outer signs of inner states can be recorded most reliable. Beside stereotypies and aberrant behaviour as clear signs of reduced welfare, especially in barren environments, the performance of species-specific behaviour can point to a positive influence on welfare. Behavioural observations over a longer period of time considering plenty of (ethological) indicators build a solid base for selection of methods. For further interpretation of results behavioural data should be supplemented by parameters which can be recorded without major distraction of the animals: general condition of the animal including injuries and soiling, performance, technical data of the husbandry conditions as well as the increasingly important evaluation of carcasses.

AB  - Although it has been long believed that new neurons were only generated during development, there is now growing evidence indicating that at least two regions in the brain are capable of continuously generating functional neurons: the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a widely observed phenomenon verified in different adult mammalian species including humans. Factors such as environmental enrichment, voluntary exercise, and diet have been linked to increased levels of AHN. Conversely, aging, stress, anxiety and depression have been suggested to hinder it. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still unclear and yet to be determined. In this paper, we discuss some recent findings addressing the effects of different dietary polyphenols on hippocampal cell proliferation and differentiation, models of anxiety, and depression as well as some proposed molecular mechanisms underlying those effects with particular focus on those related to AHN. As a whole, dietary polyphenols seem to exert positive effects on anxiety and depression, possibly in part via regulation of AHN. Studies on the effects of dietary polyphenols on behaviour and AHN may play an important role in the approach to use diet as part of the therapeutic interventions for mental-health-related conditions.

AB  - The opioid medicines administration affects anxiety processes inconsistently in an acute and chronic form. On the other hand, isolation and socially rearing is not obvious on behavioral differences in the dependency and withdrawal process. This study examines isolation and socially rearing rats on the anxiety behavior in the chronic and acute dependency on the morphine or withdrawal of it. In this experimental study, 64 male Wistar rats were divided into 8 groups of eight each: isolation and socially rearing, then these groups were divided into control (saline) and morphine sulfate (10 mg/kg) and each one of them includes the acute and chronic subgroups. The injection was conducted intraperitoneally for 10 days in acute groups and in chronic groups for 60 days. The rats were quitted after the end of the period of dependence with withdrawal drug, and their anxiety and locomotors activity indexes were measured by elevated plus maze (EPM). The results of this study indicate that, 5 days after morphine withdrawal, the percentage of the time spent on the open arm of EPM was significantly decreased compared to the control group. Also, the percentage of the time spent on the open arm in isolation-reared groups compared to the corresponding group in socially reared groups has significantly decreased (P<0.05). However, locomotor activity in the isolation and socially reared groups does not show significant differences. The findings of this study indicate that life in isolation-reared rats can increase the level of anxiety and increase the chance of addiction recurrence.

AB  - Many species in social groups make use of readily available, socially provided information for behaviours including predator avoidance, mate choice and foraging. Not only are actions imitated, but they may also be reapplied in variable future situations, suggesting an explicit knowledge of the purpose of the behaviours. Social learning thus enables animals to learn about their complex environments rapidly and efficiently, aiding survival. However, little is known of the processes underlying information transmission and the complexity of information that can be exchanged. We used shoals of guppies to investigate how animals decide which individual to copy, and the extent of information that can be transferred. Naive guppies followed the first fish to move. However, although the speed and accuracy of foraging increased significantly during training, the first fish to move was not always the trained (knowledgeable) guppy. No significant difference was found between the number of guppies entering areas of varying food quality, supporting the hypothesis that these fish learn foraging locations by following and suggesting that leaders forage without considering the reduced personal reward arising from sharing a low-quality patch with followers. Animals that learn by copying thus appear limited in the amount of information they can receive, highlighting a selection pressure for more extensive means of transmitting information in complex environments.

AB  - Learning experiences are potent modulators of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). However, the vast majority of findings on the learning-induced regulation of AHN derive from aversively-motivated tasks, mainly the water maze paradigm, in which stress is a confounding factor that affects the AHN outcome. Currently, little is known regarding the effect of appetitively-motivated training on AHN. Hence we studied how spatial learning to find food rewards in a hole-board maze modulates AHN (cell proliferation and immature neurons) and AHNrelated hippocampal neuroplasticity markers (BDNF, IGF-II and CREB phosphorylation) in mice. The 'Trained' mice were tested for both spatial reference and working memory and compared to 'Pseudotrained' mice (exposed to different baited holes in each session, thus avoiding the reference memory component of the task) and 'Control' mice (exposed to the maze without rewards). In contrast to Pseudotrained and Control mice, the number of proliferating hippocampal cells were reduced in Trained mice, but they notably increased their population of immature neurons assessed by immunohistochemistry. This evidence shows that hole-board spatial reference learning diminishes cell proliferation in favor of enhancing young neurons' survival. Interestingly, the enhanced AHN in the Trained mice (specifically in the suprapyramidal blade) positively correlated with their reference memory performance, but not with their working memory. Furthermore, the Trained animals increased the hippocampal protein expression of all the neuroplasticity markers analyzed by western blot. Results show that the appetitively-motivated hole-board task is a useful paradigm to potentiate and/or investigate AHN and hippocampal plasticity minimizing aversive variables such as fear or stress.

AB  - Background: Inefficient experimental designs are common in animal-based biomedical research, wasting resources and potentially leading to unreplicable results. Here we illustrate the intrinsic statistical power of split-plot designs, wherein three or more sub-units (e.g. individual subjects) differing in a variable of interest (e.g. genotype) share an experimental unit (e.g. a cage or litter) to which a treatment is applied (e.g. a drug, diet, or cage manipulation). We also empirically validate one example of such a design, mixing different mouse strains - C57BL/6, DBA/2, and BALB/c - within cages varying in degree of enrichment. As well as boosting statistical power, no other manipulations are needed for individual identification if co-housed strains are differentially pigmented, so also sparing mice from stressful marking procedures.
   Methods: The validation involved housing 240 females from weaning to 5 months of age in single-or mixed-strain trios, in cages allocated to enriched or standard treatments. Mice were screened for a range of 26 commonly-measured behavioural, physiological and haematological variables.
   Results: Living in mixed-strain trios did not compromise mouse welfare (assessed via corticosterone metabolite output, stereotypic behaviour, signs of aggression, and other variables). It also did not alter the direction or magnitude of any strain-or enrichment-typical difference across the 26 measured variables, or increase variance in the data: indeed variance was significantly decreased by mixed-strain housing. Furthermore, using Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the statistical power benefits of this approach over a conventional design demonstrated that for our effect sizes, the split-plot design would require significantly fewer mice (under half in most cases) to achieve a power of 80 %.
   Conclusions: Mixed-strain housing allows several strains to be tested at once, and potentially refines traditional marking practices for research mice. Furthermore, it dramatically illustrates the enhanced statistical power of split-plot designs, allowing many fewer animals to be used. More powerful designs can also increase the chances of replicable findings, and increase the ability of small-scale studies to yield significant results. Using mixed-strain housing for female C57BL/6, DBA/2 and BALB/c mice is therefore an effective, efficient way to promote both refinement and the reduction of animal-use in research.

AB  - Maternal lifestyle affects both mother health and pregnancy outcome in humans. Several studies have demonstrated that interventions oriented toward reducing stress and anxiety have positive effects on pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, excessive gestational weight, gestational diabetes and preterm birth. In this work, we showed that the environmental enrichment (EE), defined as a noninvasive and biologically significant stimulus of the sensory pathway combined with voluntary physical activity, prevented preterm birth (PTB) rate by 40% in an inflammatory mouse model induced by the systemic administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, we found that EE modulates maternal metabolism and produces an anti-inflammatory environment that contributes to pregnancy maintenance. In pregnant mice uterus, EE reduces the expression of TLR4 and CD14 (the LPS receptor and its coactivator protein), preventing the LPS-induced increase in PGE2 and PGF2 alpha release and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. In cervical tissue, EE inhibits cervical ripening events, such as PGE2 release, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 increased activity and neutrophil recruitment, therefore conserving cervical function. It seems that EE exposure could mimic the stress and anxiety-reducing techniques mentioned above, explaining, at least partially, the beneficial effects of having a healthy lifestyle before and during gestation. Furthermore, we propose that designing an EE protocol for humans could be a noninvasive and preventive therapy for pregnancy complications, averting pre-term birth occurrence and dreaded sequelae that are present in the offspring born too soon.

AB  - Exposure to a predator elicits an innate fear response and mimics several behavioral disorders related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The protective role of an enriched condition (EC) against psychogenic stressors in various animal models has been well documented. However, this condition has not been tested in field mice in the context of PTSD. In this study, we show that field mice (Mus booduga) housed under EC exhibit predominantly proactive and less reactive behavior compared with mice housed under standard conditions (SC) during exposure to their natural predator (field rat Rattus rattus). Furthermore, we observed that EC mice displayed less anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark-box after exposure to the predator (7 hrs/7 days). In EC mice, predator exposure elevated the level of serotonin (5-Hydroxytrypamine, [5-HT]) in the amygdala as part of the coping response. Subsequently, the serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5-HT1A receptor were up-regulated significantly, but the same did not occur in the 5-HT2C receptor, which is associated with the activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKII) and a transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Our results show that predator exposure induced the activation of CaMKII/CREB, which is accompanied with increased levels of histone acetylation (H3, H4) and decreased histone deacetylases (HDAC1, 2). Subsequently, in the amygdala, the transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 receptor were up-regulated, whereas the Y2 receptor was down-regulated. Therefore, EC facilitated a coping response against a fear associated cue in a PTSD animal model and reduced anxiety by differentially activating serotonergic and NPY-ergic systems.

AB  - Hatchery-reared aquatic animals tend to perform worse in natural environments than wild conspecifics. This was pointed out over a century ago and while there are many possible causes, one persistent observation is that unnatural rearing environments cause behavioral expressions unsuitable for a life in the wild. Behavioral traits being adaptive in barren, food-rich, and predator-free hatchery tanks likely differ from those being adaptive in nature. More recently, suspicions of cognitive deficiencies due to sensory deprivation have also been raised. Over the last few decades, substantial research has been devoted to produce more wild-like phenotypes in animals reared for stocking. This research includes life skills training programs, where animals learn to cope with important features of the natural environment (e.g., live food and predation risk), and environmental modifications aimed at stimulating the formation of adequate cognitive and behavioral traits (e.g., environmental enrichment and reduction of the number of individuals per tank). The main purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of the current state-of-knowledge of interventions aimed at ameliorating cognitive and behavioral deficiencies in aquatic animals reared for stocking. Furthermore, it aims to provide a foundation to assist in the development of future questions, hypotheses, and experiments to eventually improve the postrelease performance of these animals.

AB  - We examined synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in vitro in juvenile C57BI6 mice (28-40 days of age), housed in control conditions with minimal enrichment (Controls) or with access to an exercise wheel (Runners). LTP expression was significantly greater in slices from Runners than in those from Controls, but could be blocked by APV in both groups. LTP was significantly reduced by NR2B subunit antagonists in both groups. NVP-AAM077, an antagonist with a higher preference for NR2A subunits over NR2B subunits, blocked LTP in slices from Runners and produced a slight depression in Control animals. LTD in the DG was also blocked by APV, but not by either of the NR2B specific antagonists. Strikingly, NVP-AAM077 prevented LTD in Runners, but not in Control animals, suggesting an increased involvement of NR2A subunits in LTD in animals that exercise. NVP-AAM077 did not block LTD in NR2A Knock Out (KO) animals that exercised, as expected. In an attempt to discern whether NMDA receptors located at extrasynaptic sites could play a role in the induction of LTD, DL-TBOA was used to block excitatory amino acid transport and increase extracellular glutamate levels. Under these conditions, LTD was not blocked by the co-application of a specific NR2B subunit antagonist in either group, but NVP-AAM077 again blocked LTD selectively in Runners. These results indicate that NR2A and NR2B subunits play a significant role in LTP in the DG, and that exercise can significantly alter the contribution of NMDA NR2A subunits to LTD.

AB  - Chronic stress causes insensitivity to rewards (anhedonia) in rats, reflected by the absence of anticipatory behavior for a sucrose-reward, which can be reversed by antidepressant treatment or repeated announced transfer to an enriched cage. It was, however, not clear whether the highly rewarding properties of the enriched cage alone caused this reversal or whether the anticipation of this reward as such had an additional effect. Therefore, the present study compared the consequences of the announcement of a reward to the mere effect of a reward alone with respect to their efficacy to counteract the consequences of chronic stress. Two forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and long-term depression were investigated in area CA1 of the hippocampus. This was done in socially stressed rats (induced by defeat and subsequent long-term individual housing), socially stressed rats that received a reward (short-term enriched housing) and socially stressed rats to which this reward was announced by means of a stimulus that was repeatedly paired to the reward. The results were compared to corresponding control rats. We show that announcement of enriched housing appeared to have had an additional effect compared to the enriched housing per se as indicated by a significant higher amount of LTP. In conclusion, announced short-term enriched housing has a high and long-lasting counteracting efficacy on stress-induced alterations of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. This information is important for counteracting the consequences of chronic stress in both human and captive rats.

AB  - Handling stress is a well-recognised source of variation in animal studies that can also compromise the welfare of research animals. To reduce background variation and maximise welfare, methods that minimise handling stress should be developed and used wherever possible. Recent evidence has shown that handling mice by a familiar tunnel that is present in their home cage can minimise anxiety compared with standard tail handling. As yet, it is unclear whether a tunnel is required in each home cage to improve response to handling. We investigated the influence of prior experience with home tunnels among two common strains of laboratory mice: ICR(CD-1) and C57BL/6. We compared willingness to approach the handler and anxiety in an elevated plus maze test among mice picked up by the tail, by a home cage tunnel or by an external tunnel shared between cages. Willingness to interact with the handler was much greater for mice handled by a tunnel, even when this was unfamiliar, compared to mice picked up by the tail. Once habituated to handling, C57BL/6 mice were most interactive towards a familiar home tunnel, whereas the ICR strain showed strong interaction with all tunnel handling regardless of any experience of a home cage tunnel. Mice handled by a home cage or external tunnel showed less anxiety in an elevated plus maze than those picked up by the tail. This study shows that using a tunnel for routine handling reduces anxiety among mice compared to tail handling regardless of prior familiarity with tunnels. However, as home cage tunnels can further improve response to handling in some mice, we recommend that mice are handled with a tunnel provided in their home cage where possible as a simple practical method to minimise handling stress.

AB  - The serotonin transporter (SERT) gene, especially the short allele of the human serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), has been associated with the development of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. In line, exposure to early life stress in SERT knockout animals contributes to anxiety- and depression-like behavior. However, there is a lack of investigation of how early-life exposure to beneficial stimuli, such as tactile stimulation (TS), affects later life behavior in these animals. In this study, we investigated the effect of TS on social, anxiety, and anhedonic behavior in heterozygous SERT knockouts rats and wild-type controls and its impact on gene expression in the basolateral amygdala. Heterozygous SERT(+/-)rats were submitted to TS during postnatal days 8-14, for 10 min per day. In adulthood, rats were assessed for social and affective behavior. Besides, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene expression and its isoforms, components of glutamatergic and GABAergic systems as well as glucocorticoid-responsive genes were measured in the basolateral amygdala. We found that exposure to neonatal TS improved social and affective behavior in SERT(+/-)animals compared to naive SERT(+/-)animals and was normalized to the level of naive SERT(+/+)animals. At the molecular level, we observed that TSper seaffected Bdnf, the glucocorticoid-responsive genes Nr4a1, Gadd45 beta, the co-chaperone Fkbp5 as well as glutamatergic and GABAergic gene expression markers including the enzyme Gad67, the vesicular GABA transporter, and the vesicular glutamate transporter genes. Our results suggest that exposure of SERT(+/-)rats to neonatal TS can normalize their phenotype in adulthood and that TSper sealters the expression of plasticity and stress-related genes in the basolateral amygdala. These findings demonstrate the potential effect of a supportive stimulus in SERT rodents, which are more susceptible to develop psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The environment in which a laboratory animal is housed can significantly influence its behaviour and welfare, acting as a potential confounding factor for those studies in which it is utilised. This study investigated the impact of two Individually Ventilated Cage (NC) housing systems on anxiety-related behaviour and welfare indicators in two common strains of laboratory mice. Subjects were juvenile female C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice (N = 128) housed in groups of four in two different NC systems for 7 weeks. System One had air delivery at the cage 'cover' level at 75 ACH (Air Changes/Hour) and System Two had air delivery at the 'animal' level at 50 ACH. Mice were assessed twice a week (e.g. bodyweight) or at the end of the study (e.g. anxiety tests). Our results showed significant differences in anxiety-related behaviour between strains and housing systems. Mice in System Two, regardless of strain, defecated more in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), spent less time in the open arms of the EPM, and less time in the central zone of the Open Field (OF). Strain differences in anxiety-like behaviour were seen in the increased defecation by BALB/c mice in the OF and EPM and less time spent in the open arms of the EPM compared to C57BL/6J mice. These results suggest that different NC housing systems can influence mouse behaviour in different ways, with mice of both strains studied exhibiting more anxiety-related behaviour when housed in System Two (air entry at the 'animal' level at 50 ACH), which could impact upon experimental data.

AB  - Using a rat model of adolescent social stress (SS, daily 1 h isolation and change of cage partner, 30-45 days of age), we have reported sex-specific effects on neuroendocrine function over the course of SS, and enduring effects of SS in females, and not males, on drug-related behaviour. Here, we investigated both the immediate and enduring impact of SS in adolescence on anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and determined the temporal pattern of corticosterone release after confinement to the open arm of the EPM. When tested as adolescents. SS decreased anxiety-like behaviour in females and had no effect in males. When tested as adults several weeks after the chronic stress, overall, SS tended to increase anxiety-like behaviour in both sexes. However, estrous cycle moderated the effect in females, in that reduced anxiety-like behaviour was observed for SS females in the estrous group. Confinement to the open arm of the EPM increased plasma corticosterone concentrations, which declined markedly upon return to home cage for all except adolescent control males for which corticosterone concentrations at 45 and 90 min were elevated compared other groups. Among controls, anxiety-like behaviour decreased in females and increased in males with age, and confinement to the open arm of the EPM led to a greater increase in corticosterone concentrations in adult males compared to adolescent males. In sum. modest effects of adolescent social stress were observable several weeks after the stress exposure, indicating that sex-specific developmental trajectories and vulnerability to anxiety may be shaped by experiences in adolescence.

AB  - The neural basis of depression-associated cognitive impairment remains poorly understood, and the effect of antidepressants on learning and synaptic plasticity in animal models of depression is unknown. In our previous study, learning was impaired in the neonatal clomipramine model of endogenous depression. However, it is not known whether the cognitive impairment in this model responds to antidepressant treatment, and the electrophysiological and neurochemical bases remain to be determined.
   To address this, we assessed the effects of escitalopram treatment on spatial learning and memory in the partially baited radial arm maze (RAM) task and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in neonatal clomipramine-exposed rats. Also, alterations in the levels of biogenic amines and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were estimated.
   Fourteen days of escitalopram treatment restored the mobility and preference to sucrose water in the forced swim and sucrose consumption tests, respectively. The learning impairment in the RAM was reversed by escitalopram treatment. Interestingly, CA1-LTP was decreased in the neonatal clomipramine-exposed rats, which was restored by escitalopram treatment. Monoamine levels and AChE activity were decreased in several brain regions, which were restored by chronic escitalopram treatment.
   Thus, we demonstrate that hippocampal LTP is decreased in this animal model of depression, possibly explaining the learning deficits. Further, the reversal of learning and electrophysiological impairments by escitalopram reveals the important therapeutic effects of escitalopram that could benefit patients suffering from depression.

AB  - Background: Hypothalamic pathology is a well-documented feature of Huntington's disease (HD) and is believed to contribute to circadian rhythm and habitual sleep disturbances. Currently, no therapies exist to combat hypothalamic changes, nor circadian rhythm and habitual sleep disturbances in HD.
   Objective: To evaluate the effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation on hypothalamic volume, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), circadian rhythm and habitual sleep in individuals with preclinical HD.
   Methods: Eighteen individuals with HD (ten premanifest and eight prodromal) undertook a nine-month multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention (intervention group), which included exercise, cognitive and dual task training and social events, and were compared to a community sample of eleven individuals with premanifest HD receiving no intervention (control group). Hypothalamic volume, serum BDNF, salivary cortisol and melatonin concentrations, subjective sleep quality, daytime somnolence, habitual sleep-wake patterns, stress and anxiety and depression symptomatology were evaluated.
   Results: Hypothalamus grey matter volume loss was significantly attenuated in the intervention group compared to the control group after controlling for age, gender, Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Motor Score and number of cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats. Serum BDNF levels were maintained in the intervention group, but decreased in the control group following the study period. Both groups exhibited decreases in cortisol and melatonin concentrations. No changes were observed in sleep or mood outcomes.
   Conclusions: This exploratory study provides evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation can reduce hypothalamic volume loss and maintain peripheral BDNF levels in individuals with preclinical HD but may not impact on circadian rhythm. Larger, randomised controlled trials are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Human and animal studies have shown that physical challenges and stressors during adolescence can have significant influences on behavioral and neurobiological development associated with internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression. Given the prevalence of asthma during adolescence and increased rates of internalizing disorders in humans with asthma, we used a mouse model to test if and which symptoms of adolescent allergic asthma (airway inflammation or labored breathing) cause adult anxiety- and depression-related behavior and brain function. To mimic symptoms of allergic asthma in young BALB/cJ mice (postnatal days [P] 7-57; N=98), we induced lung inflammation with repeated intranasal administration of house dust mite extract (most common aeroallergen for humans) and bronchoconstriction with aerosolized methacholine (non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist). Three experimental groups, in addition to a control group, included: (1) "Airway inflammation only", allergen exposure 3 times/week, (2) "Labored breathing only", methacholine exposure once/week, and (3) "Airway inflammation + Labored breathing", allergen and methacholine exposure. Compared to controls, mice that experienced methacholine-induced labored breathing during adolescence displayed a similar to 20% decrease in time on open arms of the elevated plus maze in early adulthood (P60), a similar to 30% decrease in brainstem serotonin transporter (SERT) mRNA expression and a similar to 50% increase in hippocampal serotonin receptor la (5Htrla) and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhrl) expression in adulthood (P75). This is the first evidence that experimentally-induced clinical symptoms of adolescent asthma alter adult anxiety-related behavior and brain function several weeks after completion of asthma manipulations.

AB  - Weaning is a crucial phase of swine production marked by a multitude of biological and environmental stressors, which have a significant impact on immediate postweaning behavior and feed intake (FI). During this time, the piglet's gastrointestinal (GI) system is also undergoing extensive epithelial, immune, and nervous system development. In this review, our objective is to describe the different preweaning strategies that can be used to minimize nutrient intake disruption and improve FI in the immediate postweaning period. Reducing nutrient disruption postweaning can be accomplished through the implementation of management and nutritional strategies. Research consistently demonstrates that weaning older, more developmentally mature pigs helps prevent many of the adverse GI effects associated with weaning stress. Providing creep feed to pigs during lactation is another reliable strategy that has been shown to increase immediate postweaning FI by acclimating pigs to solid feed prior to weaning. Likewise, socialization by allowing pigs to mix before weaning improves social skills, minimizing mixing stress, and aggression-related injury immediately postweaning. Supplemental milk replacer has also been shown to elicit a positive response in preweaning growth performance, which may help to reduce preweaning mortality. While socialization and milk replacer are acknowledged to ease the weaning transition, these strategies have not been widely adopted due to labor and application challenges. Additionally, the cost of milk replacer and logistics of retrofitting farrowing houses to accommodate litter socialization have limited adaptation. Further exploration of maternal nutrition strategies, particularly fetal imprinting, is needed to better understand the implications of perinatal learning. Other areas for future research include, combining environmental enrichment with feeding strategies, such as large destructible pellets or play feeders, as well as determining at what time point producers should start socializing pigs before weaning. While more research is needed to develop strategic preweaning management programs, many of the strategies presented in this review provide opportunities for producers to minimize nutrient intake disruption by preventing feed neophobia, reducing stress, and easing the wean pig transition.

AB  - Maternal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the child. Epigenetic alternations may play an essential role in the negative effects of PTSD. This study was aimed to investigate the possible epigenetic alterations of maternal PTSD, which underpins the developmental and behavioral impact. 24 pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly grouped into PTSD and control groups. Open-field tests (OFTs), elevated pull maze (EPM) assays, gene expression profile chip tests, and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIPSeq) were performed on the offsprings 30 days after birth. The results showed that PTSD offsprings had lower body weights and OFT scores than control offsprings. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that serotonin receptor (5-HT) and dopamine levels were significantly lower in PTSD offsprings than in control offsprings. In contrast, corticosterone levels were higher in the PTSD group than in the control group. In a comparison of the PTSD group versus the control group, 4,160 significantly differentially methylated loci containing 30,657 CpGs were identified; 2,487 genes, including 13 dysmethylated genes, were validated by gene expression profiling, showing a negative correlation between methylation and gene expression (R = -0.617, P = 0.043). In conclusion, maternal PTSD could delay the physical and behavioral development of offsprings, and the underlying mechanism could contribute to changes in neurotransmitters and gene expression, owing to dysregulation of whole-genome methylation. These findings could support further clinical research on appropriate interventions for maternal PTSD to prevent methylation dysregulation and developmental retardation.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis involves the generation of new neurons, particularly in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Decreased hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in both animal models of depression and in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), despite some inconsistency in the literature. Here, we build upon current models to generate a new testable hypothesis, linking impaired neurogenesis to downstream psychological outcomes commonly observed in MDD. We contend that disruption in adult neurogenesis impairs pattern separation, a hippocampus-dependent function requiring the careful discrimination and storage of highly similar, but not identical, sensory inputs. This, in turn, can affect downstream processing and response selection, of relevance to emotional wellbeing. Specifically, disrupted pattern separation leads to misperceived stimuli (i.e., stimulus confusion), triggering the selection and deployment of established responses inappropriate for the actual stimuli. We speculate that this may be akin to activation of automatic thoughts, described in the Cognitive Behavior Theory of MDD. Similarly, this impaired ability to discriminate information at a fundamental sensory processing level (e.g., impaired pattern separation) could underlie impaired psychological flexibility, a core component of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy of MDD. We propose that research is needed to test this model by examining the relationship between cognitive functioning (e.g., pattern separation ability), psychological processes (e.g., perseveration and psychological inflexibility), and neurogenesis, taking advantage of emerging magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based imaging that measures neurogenesis in-vivo.

AB  - The present study aimed to identify morphological correlates of environment-induced changes at excitatory synapses of the primary auditory cortex (A1). We used the Golgi-Cox stain technique to compare pyramidal cells dendritic properties of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to different environmental manipulations. Sholl analysis, dendritic length measures, and spine density counts were used to monitor the effects of sensory deafness and an auditory version of environmental enrichment (EE). We found that deafness decreased apical dendritic length leaving basal dendritic length unchanged, whereas EE selectively increased basal dendritic length without changing apical dendritic length. On the contrary, deafness decreased while EE increased spine density in both basal and apical dendrites of A1 Layer 2/3 (LII/III) neurons. To determine whether stress contributed to the observed morphological changes in A1, we studied neural morphology in a restraint-induced model that lacked behaviorally relevant acoustic cues. We found that stress selectively decreased apical dendritic length in the auditory but not in the visual primary cortex. Similar to the acoustic manipulation, stress-induced changes in dendritic length possessed a layer-specific pattern displaying LII/III neurons from stressed animals with normal apical dendrites but shorter basal dendrites, while infragranular neurons (Layers V and VI) displayed shorter apical dendrites but normal basal dendrites. The same treatment did not induce similar changes in the visual cortex, demonstrating that the auditory cortex is an exquisitely sensitive target of neocortical plasticity, and that prolonged exposure to different acoustic as well as emotional environmental manipulation may produce specific changes in dendritic shape and spine density.

AB  - Scytosiphon lomentaria (Lingb.) Link. (Phaeophyceae) is one of the two dominant seaweeds in a coastal area of northern Chile affected by copper mine wastes, where the concentration of copper in water and algal tissues remains higher than in nonimpacted sites. Copper-loaded plants develop oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the increased levels of reactive oxygen species and lipoperoxides. This stress was associated with 1) an enhanced activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and dehydroascorbate reductase and 2) an inhibition of the glutathione reductase activity. Furthermore, stressed plants showed a decrease in glutathione and phenolic compounds levels and an increase in total ascorbate. Reciprocal transplants revealed that plants rapidly adjusted their antioxidant system in response to the conditions of the receiving site. In individuals transplanted from the copper-enriched environment to the control site, normal levels of lipoperoxides and antioxidant compounds were restored in 48 h and antioxidant enzymes recovered their basal activities in 96 h. Individuals transplanted from the control site to the copper-enriched area adjusted their antioxidant compounds and antioxidant enzymes within 48 h and 96 h, respectively, and reached the functional status of the local plants. We conclude that S. lomentaria inhabiting the copper-enriched area buffered oxidative stress by a simultaneous involvement of antioxidant enzymes and water-soluble antioxidant compounds. These antioxidant responses were rapid and reversible, suggesting that copper resistance in S. lomentaria is a constitutive trait and that copper enrichment of the area did not result in a locally adapted copper-tolerant ecotype.

AB  - Over the past several years, research has indicated that an individual's genetic makeup strongly influences not only their likelihood of developing depression, but also whether or not they will respond well to a particular antidepressant treatment. Identifying those genes regulating susceptibility to depression will increase our understanding of disease pathophysiology and direct the development of treatments that correct underlying neurobiological pathology related to stress-related psychiatric illnesses. Pharmacologically, the identification of genes regulating treatment response can lead to the design of novel pharmacological treatments and allow for more individualized, rational and successful drug treatments. Unfortunately, complex environmental and genetic mechanisms at play in depression and drug response make the discovery of susceptibility genes in humans quite difficult. Animal models may provide a more desirable system in which to discover susceptibility genes because environmental factors and tests can be regulated and more informative genetic methods can be used. Furthermore, a unique genetic opportunity exists with animal models of depression and antidepressant response because several rodent strains have been identified, or selectively bred, that display exaggerated depressive phenotypes on stress-related behavioral tests or divergent responses to antidepressant drugs. This paper reviews several of these rodent strains and illustrates the genetic strategies available to discover the long-sought susceptibility genes regulating these phenotypes.

AB  - Social stress is both species and gender specific. For female rats, individual housing and social instability housing conditions are associated with behavioral indicators of stress and depression. The present study directly compared the effects of six weeks of individual housing, social instability and mixed sex, semi-crowded housing in a visible burrow system (VBS) on ovariectomized female rats. Paired, stable housing was used as the control. Behavioral tests were conducted two, four and six weeks into the housing manipulations and included sucrose consumption, social interest, and activity in the open field. Following a series of four behavioral tests, animals were sacrificed and brains were processed for Golgi impregnation. Basal dendrites of CA3 hippocampal neurons were measured. Results indicate that the individual housing and social instability groups were comparable to the control group for all measures. In contrast, the rats housed in the VBS exhibited reduced activity in open field testing, and alterations in social interest. Dendritic lengths were also reduced in those animals living in the VBS in comparison to the animals housed in pairs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of behavioral and neural effects of VBS housing on female rats. Further research is necessary to determine what facets of the VBS housing are responsible for the behavioral and neural changes.

AB  - Steroid hormones are regulators of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and are central to hypotheses regarding adult neurogenesis in age-related and psychiatric disturbances associated with altered hippocampal plasticity most notably dementias and major depression. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors during adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In young mice only 27% of dividing cells in the subgranular zone expressed GR, whereas 4 weeks after division 87% had become positive for GR and,MR. GR was expressed by 50% of the radial glia-like type-1 and type-2a progenitor cells, whereas MR was expressed only by mature calbindin-positive granule cells. Doublecortin-positive neuronal progenitor cells (type-2b) and early, postmitotic calretinin-positive neurons were devoid of GR and MR expression. Fifty per cent of the intermediate type-3 cells showed GR expression, possibly reflecting cells terminating maturation. Thus, all subpopulations of dividing precursor cells showed an identical receptor profile (50% GR, no MR), except for type-2b cells, which expressed neither receptor. There was also no overlap between calretinin and GR early postnatally (P8) or after physical activity or exposure to an enriched environment, both of which are potent neurogenic stimuli. In contrast, in old age calretinin-positive young neurons became GR and MR positive, suggesting increased steroid sensitivity. Age also increased the expression of GR in type-1 and type-2a precursor cells. Other intermediates were so rare in old age that they could not be studied. This course and variability of receptor expression in aging might help to explain differential vulnerability of adult neural precursor cells to corticoid-mediated influences.

AB  - Among adolescents, overweight, obesity and metabolic syndrome are rapidly increasing in recent years as a consequence of unhealthy palatable diets. Animal models of diet-induced obesity have been developed, but little is known about the behavioural patterns produced by the consumption of such diets. The aim of the present study was to determine the behavioural and biochemical effects of a cafeteria diet fed to juvenile male and female rats, as well as to evaluate the possible recovery from these effects by administering standard feeding during the last week of the study. Two groups of male and female rats were fed with either a standard chow diet (ST) or a cafeteria (CAF) diet from weaning and for 8 weeks. A third group of males (CAF withdrawal) was fed with the CAF diet for 7 weeks and the ST in the 8th week. Both males and females developed metabolic syndrome as a consequence of the CAF feeding, showing overweight, higher adiposity and liver weight, increased plasma levels of glucose, insulin and triglycerides, as well as insulin resistance, in comparison with their respective controls. The CAF diet reduced motor activity in all behavioural tests, enhanced exploration, reduced anxiety-like behaviour and increased social interaction; this last effect was more pronounced in females than in males. When compared to animals only fed with a CAF diet, CAF withdrawal increased anxiety in the open field, slightly decreased body weight, and completely recovered the liver weight, insulin sensitivity and the standard levels of glucose, insulin and triglycerides in plasma. In conclusion, a CAF diet fed to young animals for 8 weeks induced obesity and metabolic syndrome, and produced robust behavioural changes in young adult rats, whereas CAF withdrawal in the last week modestly increased anxiety, reversed the metabolic alterations and partially reduced overweight.

AB  - Effects of environmental factors may be transmitted to the following generation, and cause neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder in the offspring. Enhanced synaptic plasticity induced by environmental enrichment may be also transmitted. We here test the hypothesis that the effects of brain injury in pregnant animals may produce neurological deficits in the offspring. Unilateral brain injury (UBI) by ablation of the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex in pregnant rats resulted in the development of hindlimb postural asymmetry (HL-PA), and impairment of balance and coordination in beam walking test in the offspring. The offspring of rats with the left UBI exhibited HL-PA before and after spinal cord transection with the contralesional (i.e., right) hindlimb flexion. The right UBI caused the offspring to develop HL-PA that however was cryptic and not-lateralized; it was evident only after spinalization, and was characterized by similar occurrence of the ipsi- and contralesional hindlimb flexion. The HL-PA persisted after spinalization suggesting that the asymmetry was encoded in lumbar spinal neurocircuits that control hindlimb muscles. Balance and coordination were affected by the right UBI but not the left UBI. Thus, the effects of a unilateral brain lesion in pregnant animals may be intergenerationally transmitted, and this process may depend on the side of brain injury. The results suggest the existence of left-right side-specific mechanisms that mediate transmission of the lateralized effects of brain trauma from mother to fetus.

AB  - In the present study adult male mice were housed for 21 days in a housing modules of the Mice Drawer System (MDS). MDS is the facility that will support the research on board the International Space Station (ISS). Our investigation focused on: circadian rhythmicity of wide behavioural categories such as locomotor activity, food intake/drinking and resting; emotionality in the elevated plus maze (EPM); body weight. Housing in the MDS determined a strong up-regulation of activity and feeding behaviour and a concomitant decrease in inactivity. Importantly, housing in the MDS disrupted circadian rhythmicity in mice and also determined a decrease in body weight. Finally, when mice were tested in the EPM a clear hyperactivity (i.e. increased total transitions) was found, while no evidence for altered anxiety was detected. In conclusion, housing adult male mice in the MDS housing modules may affect their behaviour, circadian rhythmicity while having no effect on anxiety. It is suggested that to allow adaptation to the peculiar housing allowed by MDS a longer housing duration is needed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The early environment is crucial for brain and behavior development. In particular, social experiences involving the mother and the peers are critical in shaping the adult individual. Though animal models of psychiatric disorders have widely investigated the relevance of the mother-offspring interaction, the peer interaction has so far been rarely studied. The communal nest (CN) is an innovative experimental strategy that favors a more comprehensive investigation of the long-term effects of both components. CN is a rearing condition employed by up to 90% of mouse females in naturalistic settings and consists of a single nest where two or more mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving. In a CN, the developing pup is exposed to high levels of both matemal care and interaction with peers. At adulthood, these mice display relevant changes in bran function and behavior, including high levels of neural plasticity markers, such as BDNF, and elaborate adult social competences. Overall, on the one hand, CN is an experimental approach complementary to the ones currently used that allows to investigate how the early environment determines developmental trajectories. On the other, it may represent a strategy to improve the study of animal models of psychiatric disorders characterized by social dysfunction, such as major depression, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Indeed, the more elaborate social competences shown by these mice at adulthood may allow to better characterize deficits in the social domain induced by genetic and/or environmental manipulations.

AB  - Fearful behaviour in cats is rarely the reason for behaviour consultations. However, fear or stress may be eligible causes of many behavioural problems. Depending on the aetiology, problems like house soiling, marking or aggressive behaviour can therefore be considered as fear- and stress-related problems. This article gives an overview of the behavioural problems that are associated with anxiety, fear or stress. It lists possible causes and it provides treatment options.
   Many behavioural problems in cats are caused by the ignorance of their owners. This allows the practising veterinarian to make an important contribution to the prevention of behavioural problems by providing appropriate counselling. Especially information about cat behaviour, cat-friendly housing, environmental enrichment and employment opportunities play a major role in problem prevention. In addition, for many cats, the visit to a veterinary practice is connected with fear and stress, often resulting in aggressive reactions during examination and treatment. The knowledge of feline ethology and behavioural therapy can help veterinarians in their daily work with these patients. Meanwhile, helpful advice on the reduction of stress exists. This includes, in particular, the use of cat-friendly equipment in the practice rooms and an appropriate organisation of the processes. Furthermore, the use of stress-reducing measures and as little restraint as possible in the handling of these animals is helpful. Thus, the visit to the veterinary practice will not only be more pleasant for the cat, but also for the owner and, ultimately, also for the veterinarian.

AB  - Neural stem cells in the adult brain may contribute to learning and neural plasticity, to stress-induced neuropathologic changes, to mood and affective disorders, and to other complex brain functions. Learning, an enriched environment, and exercise (as modeled by running) all increase neural stem cell proliferation in the hippocampus and improve performance on learning tests, whereas acute ethanol consumption decreases neural stem cell proliferation in the hippocampus. To explore the interaction of exercise and ethanol consumption (two behaviors important for mental health), C57BL/6 mice were given access to ethanol, a running wheel, or both, and neural stem cell proliferation was investigated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, corpus callosum, and forebrain subventricular zone of these mice. Mice given access to ethanol consumed large amounts of ethanol, and mice given access to a running wheel ran long distances, with the combined groups' behavior being comparable to that of the ethanol access alone group and of the running wheel access alone group. Neural stem cell proliferation was assessed by treating mice with bromodeoxyuridine (12 days, 300 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and evaluating consequent immunoreactivity. Exercise increased bromodeoxyuridine immunoreactivity in dentate gyrus, but not in other brain regions studied. Self-administration of ethanol decreased bromodeoxyuridine, immunoreactivity by approximately 60% (P <.01) in dentate gyrus; 70% (P <.001), in forebrain; and 80% (P <.001), in corpus callosum. Findings for exercise and ethanol consumption combined were remarkably similar to those for exercise alone. The opposing effects of ethanol consumption and exercise on neurogenesis could contribute to the CNS pathology and health benefits, respectively, of these two behaviors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The quality of the social environment can have profound influences on the development and activity of neural systems with implications for numerous behavioral and physiological responses, including the expression of emotionality. Though social experiences occurring early in development may be particularly influential on the developing brain, there is continued plasticity within these neural circuits amongst juveniles and into early adulthood. In this review, we explore the evidence derived from studies in rodents which illustrates the social modulation during development of neural systems, with a particular emphasis on those systems in which a long-term effect is observed. One possible explanation for the persistence of dynamic changes in these systems in response to the environment is the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms, and here we discuss recent studies which support the role of these mechanisms in mediating the link between social experiences, gene expression, neurobiological changes, and behavioral variation. This literature raises critical questions about the interaction between neural systems, the concordance between neural and behavioral changes, sexual dimorphism in effects, the importance of considering individual differences in response to the social environment, and the potential of an epigenetic perspective in advancing our understanding of the pathways leading to variations in mental health.

AB  - Castration and tail docking are common management practices performed on commercial swine farms in the US and around the world to reduce adverse behaviors and the occurrence of boar taint. However, these practices themselves are a welfare concern for the piglet because they cause acute pain. The provisions of environmental enrichment (EE) may reduce anxiety, protect from stressors, influence pain sensitivity, and improve the overall welfare of animals. Our objective was to determine if EE can reduce the physiological and behavioral stress response caused by castration and tail docking in piglets over time. Sows were randomly assigned to control farrowing stalls (CON; n = 9) or stalls enriched (ENRICH; n = 9) with newspaper, soil, ball and rope, so that EE was available to piglets upon birth. At 5 days old, ENRICH and CON piglets (n = 54 per treatment) were allocated to one of six piglet husbandry treatments; four boar piglets were randomly allocated to one of four treatments: 1) control handled (SHAM B), 2) tail docked (TAIL B), 3) castrated (CAST), or 4) castrated and tail docked (BOTH); and two gilt piglets were randomly allocated to one of two treatments: 5) control handled (SHAM G), or 6) tail docked (TAIL G). Live weight tended (P < 0.10) to be greater in all ENRICH pigs. Leukocytes and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were decreased (P < 0.05) among ENRICH compared with CON piglets. ENRICH piglets were more active (P < 0.05) than CON piglets. Maintenance and play behaviors decreased (P < 0.05) 120 min after, but returned to baseline at 24 h. Cortisol was greater (P < 0.05) among CAST and BOTH piglets, but no differences were observed in cortisol concentrations between housing groups. Stress vocalizations were greater (P < 0.05) in CAST and BOTH compared with SHAM piglets, while all pig processing treatments displayed more (P < 0.05) pain behaviors than SHAM. The use of EE had no effect on reducing pain-induced stress of castration and tail docking. However, we found that pigs raised with EE were heavier and more active than pigs raised without enrichment. We also found that EE modulated the immune response in pigs. In conclusion, EE improved the overall welfare of pigs at an early age.

AB  - The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) is a glutamate-activated class C G protein-coupled receptor widely expressed in the central nervous system and clinically investigated as a drug target for a range of indications, including depression, Parkinson's disease, and fragile X syndrome. Here, we present the novel potent, selective, and orally bioavailable mGlu5 negative allosteric modulator with inverse agonist properties 2-chloro-4-((2,5-dimethyl-1-(4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethynyl) pyridine (CTEP). CTEP binds mGlu5 with low nanomolar affinity and shows > 1000-fold selectivity when tested against 103 targets, including all known mGlu receptors. CTEP penetrates the brain with a brain/plasma ratio of 2.6 and displaces the tracer [(3)H]3-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-ylethynyl)-cyclohex-2-enone-O-methyl-oxime (ABP688) in vivo in mice from brain regions expressing mGlu5 with an average ED(50) equivalent to a drug concentration of 77.5 ng/g in brain tissue. This novel mGlu5 inhibitor is active in the stress-induced hyperthermia procedure in mice and the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats with minimal effective doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively, reflecting a 30- to 100-fold higher in vivo potency compared with 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) and fenobam. CTEP is the first reported mGlu5 inhibitor with both long half-life of approximately 18 h and high oral bioavailability allowing chronic treatment with continuous receptor blockade with one dose every 48 h in adult and newborn animals. By enabling long-term treatment through a wide age range, CTEP allows the exploration of the full therapeutic potential of mGlu5 inhibitors for indications requiring chronic receptor inhibition.

AB  - Objective: The effects of cafeteria and high fat diets were investigated on animal models of behavior.
   Methods: Male Wistar rats were treated with Control (C), Cafeteria (CD) and High Fat (FD) diets and tested in the Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) procedures. Body weight, length, abdominal circumference, retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose tissues were recorded. Physical parameters, weight of tissues, EPM, and MWM data were subjected to ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test (P<0.05).
   Results: There were no differences on weight and length parameters between CD and C rats up to 98 days of age. However, abdominal circumferences were higher in CD as compared to C at 35 and 70 days of age, respectively, the 5th and the 7th weeks. FD presented lower measures of weight and abdominal circumference; nevertheless there was an increase on those parameters at the end of the nutritional treatment. Even without an apparent weight gain of CD and FD these animals presented a greater accumulation of retroperitoneal and epididymal adipose tissues. In addition, CD and FD demonstrated behaviors that can suggest lower anxiety. CD showed a better learning performance and FD showed better recall of previous learned information in the memory retention test.
   Discussion: According to those data it was concluded that hypercaloric diet ingestion was capable of triggering metabolic alterations and possibly lowering anxiety associated to learning or memory improvement on a spatial task.

AB  - Individual differences in response to social stress and environmental enrichment may contribute to variability in response to behavioral and pharmacological treatments for drug addiction. In monkeys, social status influences the reinforcing effects of cocaine and the effects of some drugs on cocaine self-administration. In this study, we used male cynomolgus macaques (n= 15) living in established social groups to examine the effects of social confrontation on the reinforcing effects of cocaine using a food-drug choice procedure. On the test day, a dominant or subordinate monkey was removed from his homecage and placed into another social pen; 30 min later he was studied in a cocaine-food choice paradigm. For the group, following social confrontation, sensitivity to cocaine reinforcement was significantly greater in subordinate monkeys compared with dominant animals. Examining individual-subject data revealed that for the majority of monkeys (9/15), serving as an intruder in another social group affected cocaine self-administration and these effects were dependent on the social rank of the monkey. For subordinate monkeys, sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of cocaine increased while sensitivity decreased in dominant monkeys. To investigate potential mechanisms mediating these effects, brain glucose metabolism was studied in a subset of monkeys (n = 8) using [(18)proves] fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)proves] FDG) with positron emission tomography. Dominant and subordinate monkeys displayed distinctly different patterns of brain glucose metabolism in their homecage, including areas associated with vigilance and stress/anxiety, respectively, and during social confrontation. These data demonstrate that, depending on an individual's social status, the same social experience can have divergent effects on brain function and cocaine self-administration. These phenotypic differences in response to social conditions support a personalized treatment approach to cocaine addiction.

AB  - Group-housing is highly important for social animals. Group-housing of male mice in captivity though often leads to aggression with partially disastrous consequences for the animals as well as for the quality of experimental data. In this study we investigated the effect of a novel "cross-enrichment", i.e. a colored partial cage divider, which is provided in transparent or black and which is partly separating the cage in four small areas. Group-housed male C57BL/6NCrl mice (three per cage) were maintained under either standard conditions (nestles group) or enriched conditions (nestles + cage divider in black [EB-group] or in transparent [ET-group]) for eight weeks. Several physiological parameters (body weight, blood glucose, stress induced hyperthermia, fecal corticosterone metabolites and organ weights) and behavioral tests (Nest test, Openfield/social Novel-Object, Dark-Light-Box, Hotplate and Resident-Intruder test) were measured/performed to determine enrichment-induced effects. In comparison to nestles- and ET-group animals, EB-mice showed significant increased stress-associated parameters, i.e. in the blood glucose concentration. Furthermore, EB animals seemed to have enhanced emotional stress with a poorer outcome in the nest test and a higher amount of fecal boli at the end of the social Novel-Object test. Additionally, EB-mice behaved more aggressively towards conspecifics after cleaning cages. We conclude that the opacity of the tested partial cage dividers has a huge impact on aggressive behavior and therefore may lead to significant changes in behavioral and physical measures potentially altering research outcomes.

AB  - Animal keepers at zoos and wildlife rescue centers often possess in-depth knowledge of the health and behavior of the individuals under their care. While it is often not feasible for keepers to regularly collect behavior data through formal scientific methods, efforts should be made to find alternative means to capture this knowledge. We investigated the use of keeper feedback to study the behavior of sloth bears at the Agra Bear Rescue Facility (ABRF; Agra, India). We prepared a survey with 5 questions focused on behaviors indicative of playfulness, boldness, aggressiveness, and the tendency to express self-directed behaviors (SDB). We asked keepers to rate bears on a Likert scale from 1 (least likely to exhibit a behavior) to 5 (most likely) for 44 adult female bears (5-21 years of age). We validated this method by comparing keeper ratings of SDB with formal behavior observations, finding that time of day had an influence on the accuracy of keeper assessments. We found a significant negative correlation between housing bears in larger groups (>15) and SDB. In addition, we correlated ratings given by keepers for all study behaviors. Social play had significant negative correlation with aggression toward people. There was no correlation between social play and aggression toward other bears, possibly due to the existence of cohesive social groups in group housing or high dimensionality of the data. We found that keeper feedback is an efficient tool to gather behavior data on captive sloth bears and recommend its use in future studies.

AB  - The Roman High-Avoidance (RHA) and the Roman Low-Avoidance (RLA) rats, represent two psychogenetically-selected lines that are, respectively, resistant and prone to displaying depression-like behavior, induced by stressors. In the view of the key role played by the neurotrophic factors and neuronal plasticity, in the pathophysiology of depression, we aimed at assessing the effects of acute stress, i.e., forced swimming (FS), on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its trkB receptor, and the Polysialilated-Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (PSA-NCAM), in the dorsal (dHC) and ventral (vHC) hippocampus of the RHA and the RLA rats, by means of western blot and immunohistochemical assays. A 15 min session of FS elicited different changes in the expression of BDNF in the dHC and the vHC. In RLA rats, an increment in the CA2 and CA3 subfields of the dHC, and a decrease in the CA1 and CA3 subfields and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the vHC, was observed. On the other hand, in the RHA rats, no significant changes in the BDNF levels was seen in the dHC and there was a decrease in the CA1, CA3, and DG of the vHC. Line-related changes were also observed in the expression of trkB and PSA-NCAM. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the differences in the BDNF/trkB signaling and neuroplastic mechanisms are involved in the susceptibility of RLA rats and resistance of RHA rats to stress-induced depression.

AB  - Breeding and welfare problems confront many conservation breeding programs. Stereotypies-repetitive, unvarying, functionless behaviours -are common abnormal behaviours that often arise in suboptimal conditions. While the role of stereotypies in welfare assessment is well studied, few investigations address the relationship between stereotypic behaviour and reproduction. We examined the correlation between stereotypic behaviour and reproductive performance in 101 giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). High stereotyping males copulated more and produced more cubs, suggesting that highly sexually motivated males were prone to stereotypy but also had high reproductive competence. Female stereotypies were negatively associated with all reproductive measures closely tied to behavioural competence: high stereotyping females were less likely to copulate, less likely to mother-rear cubs, and-probably a result of poor maternal care-had lower cub survival. However, females that exhibited stereotypies were more likely to produce a cub, suggesting stereotypies are tied to behavioural but not physiological competence. High stereotyping female pandas also displayed strong and consistent bias toward production of female offspring while paternal relationship to sex allocation was the reverse. These results are consistent with stress-mediated sex allocation theory. Our findings raise concern about differential reproductive success among high and low stereotyping pandas, and possible genetic adaptation to captivity.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, characterised by the degeneration of motor neurons innervating skeletal muscle. The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in ALS are not yet fully elucidated, and with current therapeutics only able to extend lifespan by a matter of months there is a clear need for novel therapies to increase lifespan and patient quality of life. Here, we evaluated whether moderate-intensity treadmill exercise and/or treatment with metallothionein-2 (MT2), a neuroprotective protein, could improve survival, behavioural or neuropathological outcomes in SOD1(G93A) familial ALS mice. Six-week-old female SOD1(G93A) mice were allocated to one of four treatment groups: MT2 injection, i.m.; moderate treadmill exercise; neither MT2 nor exercise; or both MT2 and exercise. MT2-treated mice survived around 3% longer than vehicle-treated mice, with this mild effect reaching statistical significance in Cox proportional hazards analysis once adjusted for potential confounders. Mixed model body weight trajectories over time indicated that MT2-treated mice, with or without exercise, reached maximum body weight at a later age, suggesting a delay in disease onset of around 4% compared to saline-treated mice. Exercise alone did not significantly increase survival or delay disease onset, and neither exercise nor MT2 substantially ameliorated gait abnormalities or muscle strength loss. We conclude that neither exercise nor MT2 treatment was detrimental in female SOD1(G93A) mice, and further study could determine whether the mild effect of peripheral MT2 administration on disease onset and survival could be improved via direct administration of MT2 to the central nervous system.

AB  - This study examined the effect of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, on isolation-induced changes on sucrose consumption and preference, spontaneous open-field activity, forced swimming behavior, and on tissue levels of 5-HT and dopamine (DA) in hippocampus and ventral striatum (VS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were reared in social isolation or group housing from postnatal day 28. Thirty-two days later, half of the isolated animals were orally treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) during the following 34 days. At the end of this period, behavior was assessed and afterward ex-vivo tissue samples were obtained. It was found that fluoxetine restored isolation-increased sucrose consumption and immobility behavior, without affecting locomotor activity, which appeared slightly increased in isolated groups both treated and untreated. In the hippocampus, isolation rearing depleted 5-HT contents and increased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels, as well as 5-HT and DA turnover. These neurochemical alterations were reversed by fluoxetine. In VS, treated and untreated isolated rats showed higher 5-HT levels than grouped congeners. Although fluoxetine did not affect 5-HT and DA contents in this region, it slightly reversed the alterations in the 5-HT and DA turnover observed in isolated rats. Overall, social isolation impaired incentive and escape motivated behaviors. At the neurochemical level, isolation rearing affected 5-HT rather than DA activity, and this differential effect was more noticeable in hippocampus than in VS. The chronic treatment with fluoxetine during the last month of rearing somewhat prevented these behavioral and neurochemical alterations.

AB  - The majority of laboratory animals is a prey in nature, therefore they can be used in the fields of many pshychological researches, such as modeling different human anxiety syndromes. Previously the rat used to be the primary model, but parellel to the development of molecular biology, sensitive transgenic mouse models appeared. To be able to effectively use these animals, the authors overview the natural behaviour of mice and their reaction in answering various situations. There are great differences amongst the phenotypes of the individual strains and lines, including behaviour and temperament, for example the CD1 mice are calm, the BALB/c ones rather irritate (Figure 1-3). In addition, during the experimentation a kind of environment should be assured mice to gratify their natural action catalogue, prevent influencing the results of the tests. The environmental enrichment influences animals' ethology, physiology and brain functions. The acoustic enrichment of the environment, namely the use of musical sound stimuli, became more and more preferred. A continuous background music may appease animals and decrease the stress of the constant, inevitable and abrupt noises. Moreover, it might have an effect on human, working with the animals and by this way may also influence the latter. The assumption is logical that the use of music might help to improve animal welfare and assure the standardisation and repeatability of experiments, as well as the reliability of the results. To achieve this, sufficient information is required about the musical preference of the most important experimental animal, the mouse and its strains: which type of music, in which hearing ranges and frequencies, applied in which circumstances are different or even harmful.

AB  - Self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) are a welfare and practical concern in laboratory rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and may share a similar etiology to human SIBs. This review uses a Tinbergian perspective to investigate why rhesus monkeys perform SIBs. In addition to reviewing research specifically focused on rhesus macaque SIBs, this paper reports data on human SIBs to help explain the behavior in non-human primates. This review is broken into four distinct sections based on Tinbergen's 'four whys' of behavior: phylogeny, ontogeny, causation, and function. The first section, phylogeny, presents a few studies that link SIBs to monoamine-related genes. Phylogeny of SIBs as a whole, however, is insufficiently researched in non-human primates, as data are scarce on at-risk primate species and heritable factors. The developmental section attributes SIBs to rearing experiences (e.g., isolation housing and surrogate rearing), history of stressful experiences (e.g., husbandry and research protocols), and at-risk life stages (e.g., adolescence). Together these two sections help explain the origin of SIB-vulnerable phenotypes. Next, the causation section looks at potential internal mechanisms (e.g., neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, hormones, and affective states), behavioral and psychological correlates of SIBs (e.g., stereotypic behaviors, floating limb syndrome, and cognitive inflexibility), and external stimuli (e.g., individual housing, outdoor housing, and environmental enrichment). Lastly, the function section utilizes data on human self-report to consider putative benefits of SIBs such as self-stimulation and coping with stress and/or perhaps neuropathic pain. It addition, this section considers how these behaviors may alternatively represent brain dysfunction. In the final discussion and conclusion, treatment implications inspired by each of the four whys are considered, as well as the merits of using Tinbergen's approach to study abnormal behaviors.

AB  - Treatment resistance of anxiety-related disorders often arises from an inappropriate fear expression, impairment in fear extinction, and spontaneous return of fear. Stress exposure is considered a high risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, but understanding of the long-term consequences of stress is limited, particularly when it comes to treatment outcome. Therefore, studying the consequences of acute stress would provide critical information on the role of stress in psychopathology. In the present study, we investigated the effect of acute immobilization stress on anxiety-like behavior and on conditioned fear memory. Our results demonstrate that prior stress exposure had no effect on anxiety-related behavior, fear acquisition, as well as fear extinction compared to non-stressed controls, but resulted in significantly higher rates of freezing during recall of extinction, indicating a consolidation failure. Further, immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos after recall of extinction revealed increased neuronal activity in the posterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in previously stressed animals compared to non-stressed controls. These results indicate, firstly, that acute stress affects long-term fear memory even after successful extinction training, and secondly, a strong involvement of the PVT in maladaptive fear responses induced by prior stress. Thus, stress-induced changes in PVT neuronal activity might be of importance for the pathophysiology of stresssensitive anxiety-related psychiatric disorders, since exposure to an earlier acute stressor could counteract the success of therapy.

AB  - The central endocannabinoid system (ECS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis mediate individual responses to emotionally salient stimuli. Their altered developmental adjustment may relate to the emergence of emotional disturbances. Although environmental influences regulate the individual phenotype throughout the entire lifespan, their effects may result particularly persistent during plastic developmental stages (e. g. prenatal life and adolescence). Here, we investigated whether prenatal stress - in the form of gestational exposure to corticosterone supplemented in the maternal drinking water (100 mg/l) during the last week of pregnancy - combined with a pharmacological stimulation of the ECS during adolescence (daily fatty acid amide hydrolase URB597 i.p. administration - 0.4 mg/kg - between postnatal days 2938), influenced adult mouse emotional behaviour and brain metabolism measured through in vivo quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Compared to control mice, URB597-treated subjects showed, in the short-term, reduced locomotion and, in the long term, reduced motivation to execute operant responses to obtain palatable rewards paralleled by reduced levels of inositol and taurine in the prefrontal cortex. Adult mice exposed to prenatal corticosterone showed increased behavioural anxiety and reduced locomotion in the elevated zero maze, and altered brain metabolism (increased glutamate and reduced taurine in the hippocampus; reduced inositol and N-Acetyl-Aspartate in the hypothalamus). Present data further corroborate the view that prenatal stress and pharmacological ECS stimulation during adolescence persistently regulate emotional responses in adulthood. Yet, whilst we hypothesized these factors to be interactive in nature, we observed that the consequences of prenatal corticosterone administration were independent from those of ECS drug-induced stimulation during adolescence.

AB  - With the recent confirmation that neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain, and that neural stem cells reside in the adult central nervous system (CNS), the function of newly generated neuronal cells in the adult brain is the source of intense research and debate. Neurogenesis is modulated by a wide variety of physiopathological conditions and environmental stimuli, offering the possibility that newly generated neuronal cells might be functionally associated with the response to these processes. Newly generated neuronal cells in the hippocampus have also been implicated in mechanisms of learning, memory and depression. However, a number of studies have challenged some of these findings, and the roles of newly generated neuronal cells in the functioning of the CNS remain to be fully understood. Neurogenesis has been shown to increase bilaterally in the adult brain and new neuronal cells are generated at sites of degeneration in the brain during disease and after injuries. Taken together, these findings suggest that new neuronal cells may be involved in processes such as homeostasis of brain tissue, regeneration, plasticity, and neuroadaptation.

AB  - Copper (Cu) can be toxic to vegetables when it is absorbed and accumulated at large concentrations, a fact that increases the risk of excessive addition of this metal to the human food chain. The aims of the current study are (1) to determine the Cu concentrations that have critical toxic effects on beet and cabbage plants, and the potential of these plants to enter the human food chain, as well as (2) to assess the physiological and biochemical responses of representatives of these vegetables grown in nutrient solution presenting increasing Cu concentrations. Beet and cabbage plants were grown for 75 days in pots filled with sand added with nutrient solution presenting six Cu concentrations: 0.00, 0.52, 1.02, 1.52, 2.02 and 2.52 mg Cu L-1. Dry matter yield and Cu accumulation in different plant organs were evaluated. Photosynthetic pigment contents, lipid peroxidation levels (TBARs), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activity and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations in leaves were evaluated. Critical Cu concentrations that led to toxicity in plant organs such as beetroot and cabbage head, which are often found in human diets, corresponded to 1.43 mg Cu L-1 and 1.59 mg Cu L-1, respectively. High Cu concentrations in the nutrient solution have increased Cu concentrations and accumulation in plant tissues. This outcome justified the increased POD and SOD enzyme activity in the leaves of beet and cabbage plants, respectively, and was the cause of reduced plant growth in both crops. Cabbage plants presented higher tolerance to increased Cu levels in the growing environment than beet plants. However, it is necessary being careful at the time to consume both vegetables, when they are grown in Cu-enriched environments.

AB  - Objective: For many generations, most species of farm animals have been subjected to intense and strictly targeted selection for improvement of their performance traits. This has led to substantial changes in animal anatomy and physiology, which resulted in considerable differences between the current animal breeds and their wild ancestors. The aim of the study was to determine whether there is breed-specific variability in behaviour as well as differences in emotional reactivity and preferences of laying hens.
   Methods: The investigations involved 50 Green-legged Partridge, 50 Polbar, and 50 Leghorn hens. All birds were kept in the same conditions, and the behavioural tests were carried out at 30 weeks of age. We used the tonic immobility test and a modified open-field test including such objects as water, commercial feed, feed enriched with cereal grains, finely cut straw, and insect larvae, a sandpit, a mirror, and a shelter imitating a hen nest.
   Results: The research results demonstrate that the birds of the analysed breeds differ not only in the excitability and emotional reactivity but, importantly, also in the preferences for environment-enriching elements. Ensuring hens' well-being should therefore be based on environmental modifications that will facilitate acquisition of essential elements of chickens' behaviour. The greatest emotional reactivity was found in the Leghorn breed, which may be a result of correlated selection aimed at an increase in chicken productivity.
   Conclusion: The differences in the behaviour of the birds from the analysed breeds indicate that laying hens cannot be regarded as one group of animals with the same environmental requirements.

AB  - The importance of social interactions has been reported in a variety of animal species. In human and rodent models, social isolation is known to alter social behaviors and change anxiety or depression levels. During the coronavirus pandemic, although people could communicate with each other through other sensory cues, social touch was mostly prohibited under different levels of physical distancing policies. These social restrictions inspired us to explore the necessity of physical contact, which has rarely been investigated in previous studies on mouse social interactions. We first conducted a long-term observation to show that pair-housed mice in a standard laboratory cage spent nearly half the day in direct physical contact with each other. Furthermore, we designed a split-housing condition to demonstrate that even with free access to visual, auditory, and olfactory social signals, the lack of social touch significantly increased anxiety-like behaviors and changed social behaviors. There were correspondingly higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in the hippocampus in mice with no access to physical contact. Our study demonstrated the necessity of social touch for the maintenance of mental health in mice and could have important implications for human social interactions.

AB  - Opposing emotional events (negative/trauma or positive/maternal care) during the postnatal period may differentially influence vulnerability to the effects of stress later in life. The development and course of intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease are negatively affected by persistent stress, but to date the role of positive life events on these pathologies has been entirely unknown. In the present study, the effect of early life beneficial experiences in the development of intestinal dysfunctions, where inflammation and stress stimuli play a primary role, was investigated. As a "positive'' experimental model we used adult male rat progeny nursed by mothers whose drinking water was supplemented with moderate doses of corticosterone (CORT) (0.2 mg/ml) during the lactation period. Such animals have been generally shown to cope better with different environmental situations during life. The susceptibility to inflammatory experimental colitis induced by intracolonic infusion of TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid) was investigated in CORT-nursed rats in comparison with control rats. This mild increase in maternal corticosterone during lactation induced, in CORT-nursed rats, a long lasting protective effect on TNBS-colitis, characterized by improvements in some indices of the disease (increased colonic myeloperoxidase activity, loss of body weight and food intake) and by the involvement of endogenous peripheral pathways known to participate in intestinal disorder development (lower plasma corticosterone levels and colonic mast cell degranulation, alterations in the colonic expression of both corticotrophin releasing factor/CRF and its receptor/CRH-1R). All these findings contribute to suggesting that the reduced vulnerability to TNBS-colitis in CORT-nursed rats is due to recovery from the colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction. Such long lasting changes induced by mild hormonal manipulation during lactation, making the adult also better adapted to colonic inflammatory stress, constitute a useful experimental model to investigate the etiopathogenetic mechanisms and therapeutic treatments of some gastrointestinal diseases.

AB  - The developing brain in utero and during the first years of life is highly vulnerable to environmental influences. Experiences occurring during this period permanently modify brain structure and function through epigenetic modifications (alterations of the DNA structure and chromatin function) and consequently affect the susceptibility to mental disorders. In this review, we describe evidence linking adverse environmental variation during early life (from the fetal period to childhood) and long-term changes in brain volume, microstructure, and connectivity, especially in amygdala and hippocampal regions. We also describe genetic variations that moderate the impact of adverse environmental conditions on child neurodevelopment, such as polymorphisms in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and catechol-O-methyltransferase genes, as well as genetic pathways related to glutamate and monoaminergic signaling. Lastly, we have depicted positive early life experiences that could benefit childhood neurodevelopment and reverse some detrimental effects of adversity in the offspring. What this paper adds
   Prenatal, peripartum, and postnatal adversities influence child behavior and neurodevelopment. Exposure to environmental enrichment and positive influences may revert these effects. Putative mechanisms involve alterations in neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitter systems. New tools/big data improved the understanding on how early adversity alters neurodevelopment. This permits better translation/application of the findings from animal models to humans.

AB  - Ketamine has been described as a fast-acting antidepressant, exerting effects in depressed patients and in preclinical models with a rapid onset of action. The typical antidepressant fluoxetine is known to induce plasticity in the adult rodent visual cortex, as assessed by a shift in ocular dominance, a classical model of brain plasticity, and a similar effect has been described for ketamine and its metabolite 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (R,R-HNK). Here, we demonstrate that ketamine (at 3 or 20 mg/kg) and R,R-HNK facilitated the shift in ocular dominance in monocularly deprived mice, after three injections, throughout the 7-day monocular deprivation regimen. Notably, the comparison between the treatments indicates a higher effect size of R,R-HNK compared with ketamine. Treatment with ketamine or R,R-HNK failed to influence the levels of perineuronal nets (PNNs) surrounding parvalbumin-positive interneurons. However, we observed in vitro that both ketamine and R,R-HNK are able to disrupt the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) interaction with the protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTP sigma), which upon binding to PNNs dephosphorylates TRKB. These results support a model where diverse drugs promote the reinstatement of juvenile-like plasticity by directly binding TRKB and releasing it from PTP sigma regulation, without necessarily reducing PNNs deposits.

AB  - Given the close genetic link between humans and nonhuman great apes, the well-being of the latter in captivity is understandably controversial. Behavioural signs of boredom, anxiety and stress in captive great apes have been linked to being reared in small groups or by humans, and by having a lack of control over the environment. This review proposes a new framework for great ape enrichment, inspired by a century of cognitive research. Problem-solving tasks that are designed so challenge the evolved cognitive skills of great apes might allow subjects to have more control in inherently restricted environments. These sorts of tasks have historically been used to test the comparative cognitive abilities of great apes housed in research facilities, with few parallel assessments of well-being. However, there is great potential for 'cognitive challenge' tasks to be applied to great apes in a range of captive settings for the enhancement of well-being. This is based on recent research on farmed animals, demonstrating that they may seek cognitive challenges and benefit from their own learning success. A new definition of 'cognitive enrichment' - where an appropriate cognitive challenge results in measurable beneficial changes to well-being - is proposed to encourage research at the interface of great ape cognition and well-being. Finally, two approaches to great ape cognitive enrichment - 'low-investment' and 'high-investment' - are proposed for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animal cognition covers various mental processes including perception, learning, decision-making and memory, and animal behavior is often used as a proxy for measuring cognition. Animal cognition/behavior research has multiple benefits; it provides fundamental knowledge of animal biology and evolution but can also have applied conservation and welfare applications. Zoos provide an excellent yet relatively untapped resource for animal cognition research, because they house a wide variety of species-many of which are under threat-and allow close observation and relatively high experimental control compared to the wild. Multi-zoo collaboration leads to increased sample size and species representation, which in turn leads to more robust science. However, there are salient challenges associated with zoo-based cognitive research, which are animal-based (e.g., small sample sizes at single zoos, untrained/unhabituated subjects, side effects) and human-based (e.g., time restrictions, safety concerns, and perceptions of animals interacting with unnatural technology or apparatus). We aim to increase the understanding and subsequent uptake of animal cognition research in zoos, by transparently outlining the main benefits and challenges. Importantly, we use our own research (1) a study on novelty responses in hornbills, and (2) a multi-site collaboration called the "ManyBirds" Project to demonstrate how challenges may be overcome. These potential options include using "drop and go" apparatuses that require no training, close human contact or animal separation. This study is aimed at zoo animal care and research staff, as well as external researchers interested in zoo-based studies.

AB  - In the present study, male inbred animals (from the 10th generation of an inbreeding program that has been carried out in parallel to that of the outbred Roman high- and low-avoidance rat lines), were compared for emotionality in different testing situations, exploratory behavior in the holeboard and two-way, active-avoidance acquisition. Compared to the inbred Roman high-avoidance (RHA-I/Verh) rats, inbred Roman low-avoidance (RLA-I-Verh) rats showed higher emotionality in the open field (reduced distance travelled and number of rearings, and increased self-grooming behavior), in the elevated plus-maze test (increased number of total and open-arm entries, reduced distance travelled in the open arms, and increased self-grooming behavior), and during the habituation period in the shuttle box (decreased number of crossings, increased self-grooming behavior and defecations). Results from the hyponeophagia test were not conclusive, probably due to the test-dependent hyperactivity shown by RHA-I/Verh rats. In the holeboard apparatus, RHA-I/Verh rats explored more than RLA-I/Verh rats, especially when novel objects were located beneath the holes. Finally, RHA-I/Verh animals rapidly acquired active, two-way (shuttlebox) avoidance, whereas RLA-I/Verh animals required four 50-trial sessions to achieve an assymptotic level of 30-40% avoidance. Thus, the behavioral patterns of the Roman inbred strains were very similar to those previously reported for the RHA/Verh outbred lines. Differences in locomotor activity, exploratory, and self-grooming behavior were actually greater between the inbred strains than between the outbred lines. Differences in defecation, however, although still significant, were not so pronounced as those noted previously at this laboratory with the outbred lines. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The pig industry faces many animal welfare issues. Among these, biting behaviour has a high incidence. It is indicative of an existing problem in biters and is a source of physical damage and psychological stress for the victims. We categorize this behaviour into aggressive and non-aggressive biting, the latter often being directed towards the tail. This review focusses specifically on predisposing factors in early life, comprising the prenatal and postnatal periods up to weaning, for the expression of aggressive and non-aggressive biting later in life. The influence of personality and coping style has been examined in a few studies. It varies according to these studies and, thus, further evaluation is needed. Regarding the effect of environmental factors, the number of scientific papers is low (less than five papers for most factors). No clear influence of prenatal factors has been identified to date. Aggressive biting is reduced by undernutrition, cross-fostering and socialization before weaning. Non-aggressive biting is increased by undernutrition, social stress due to competition and cross-fostering. These latter three factors are highly dependent on litter size at birth. The use of familiar odours may contribute to reducing biting when pigs are moved from one environment to another by alleviating the level of stress associated with novelty. Even though the current environment in which pigs are expressing biting behaviours is of major importance, the pre-weaning environment should be optimized to reduce the likelihood of this problem.

AB  - Recent studies in rats and mice suggest that developmental plasticity of HPA-stress and fear responses could be mediated by environment-dependent variations in maternal behaviour. The present study was designed to examine this question further by varying the adversity of the maternal environment to study its effects on nest-attendance and maternal care and on the HPA and fear responses in the adult offspring. C57BL/6 dams and their litter were housed in a cage system composed of a nest cage (NC) and a foraging cage (FC) connected by a tunnel. Using a 2 X 2 factorial design, we varied the maternal foraging environment (FC) by the presence or absence of rat odour (feces) and shelters (MouseHouse and tube) from postnatal days 1-14 and assessed the adult offspring's corticosterone response to isolation/novelty stress and their behaviour in three tests of fearfulness (elevated-O-maze, open-field, free exploration). While the presence of shelters in the FC reduced time spent in the NC (nest site attendance), the presence of rat odour in the FC increased active maternal care without altering nest site attendance. Alterations of the offspring's HPA and fear responses were rather subtle. The presence of shelters in the dam's foraging environment decreased fearfulness in the offspring in the free exploration test. In addition, males reared by dams exposed to rat odour were less fearful in the open-field test, and both males and females reared by dams without shelters and rat odour in the FC showed a greater corticosterone response to isolation/novelty stress. Multiple regression analysis indicated a negative relationship between maternal licking/grooming and fearfulness in males and a positive relationship between nest site attendance and fearfulness in females. Taken together, these results indicate that mouse darns adjust specific aspects of maternal behaviour in response to the specific properties of their environment, and that active maternal care and nest site attendance are two aspects of maternal behaviour that may affect the offspring's stress and fear systems independent of each other and in a sex-specific way.

AB  - In the adult eutherian brain, stem cells in the dentate gyrus continually divide throughout adult life and into old age producing new granule cells. However, it was not known whether this is also the case for marsupials. Previously, in fact, it was thought that marsupials did not have continued neurogenesis in the mature brain. Here we examined neurogenesis in the adult brain of a small marsupial, the fat-tailed dunnart, using H-3-thymidine to label newly generated cells. We showed that neurogenesis takes place in the adult dentate gyrus along its inner margin, as seen in eutherian mammals. Control animals had similar numbers of labeled cells 24 h and 1 month after 3H-thymidine injection. An enriched environment resulted in similar numbers of cells being generated as controls. However, there was a significant decline in the number of labeled cells one month later. Stress and old age resulted in significantly lower numbers of new cells being generated. In immunohistochemically treated control brains, H-3-thymidine-labeled cells at the early stage were sometimes GFAP positive, were not calbindin positive at either stage examined and at the later stage were PSA-NCAM positive. We hypothesize that, as seen in eutherian mammals, the new cells progressed from being GFAP positive at stem cell stage to PSA-NCAM positive during outgrowth of mossy fibers 1 month later, to calbindin positive when mature. It is possible that maturity of these cells was not reached by 1 month as marsupials have a slower metabolic rate and this species also undergoes daily periods of torpor. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

AB  - Behavioural profiles can be shaped by genotype and environmental factors during early phases of life. The aim of this study was to investigate whether anxiety-like behaviour, exploration and adrenocortical stress responses can be modulated by genotype and social experiences in adulthood. Male mice lacking the serotonin transporter gene which is under scrutiny for anxiety disorders were compared with heterozygous and wildtype controls. Concerning social experiences, the males of all three genotypes were provided with a winner or a loser experience in a resident-intruder paradigm on three consecutive days. Anxiety-like behaviour and exploration were recorded in the dark-light, elevated plus-maze and open-field test. To non-invasively assess adrenocortical activity, corticosterone metabolites were determined from feces. The main findings were: Repeated social experience, irrespective of winning or losing, elevated levels of anxiety-like behaviour and decreased exploration. In losers a distinct effect of genotype occurred, with homozygous knockout males showing more anxiety-like behaviour and less exploration than the other genotypes. In winners no genotype-dependent variation was found. Genotypes did not differ in basal stress hormone secretion. There was, however, a main effect of social experience with higher activation of the stress hormone system in losers than in winners. This effect was strongest in the heterozygous genotype. In conclusion, our data show that anxiety circuits retain their plasticity throughout adulthood and can be shaped by genotype and social experiences during this phase of life. Moreover, responsiveness towards negative life experiences is influenced significantly by the 5-HTT genotype. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Until recently, there were few rodent models available to study the interaction of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug taking. Like PTSD, single prolonged stress (SPS) produces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction and alters psychostimulant self-administration. Other stressors, such as isolation stress, also alter psychostimulant self-administration. However, it is currently unknown if isolation housing combined with SPS can alter the acquisition or maintenance of cocaine self-administration. The current study applied modified SPS (modSPS; two hours restraint immediately followed by cold swim stress) to rats raised in an isolation condition (Iso), enrichment condition (Enr), or standard condition (Std) to measure changes in cocaine self-administration and HPA markers. Regardless of rearing condition, rats exposed to modSPS had greater corticosterone (CORT) release and reduced cocaine self-administration during initial acquisition compared to non-stressed controls. In addition, during initial acquisition, rats that received both Iso rearing and modSPS showed a more rapid increase in cocaine self-administration across sessions compared to Enr and Std rats exposed to modSPS. Following initial acquisition, a dose response analysis showed that Iso rats were overall most sensitive to changes in cocaine unit dose; however, modSPS had no effect on the cocaine dose response curve. Further, there was no effect of either modSPS or differential rearing on expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in hypothalamus, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, or nucleus accumbens. By using modSPS in combination with Iso housing, this study identified unique contributions of each stressor to acquisition of cocaine self-administration.

AB  - The hippocampus and amygdala have been proposed as key neural structures related to anxiety. A more active hippocampus/amygdala system has been related to greater anxious responses in situations involving conflict/novelty. The Roman Low- (RLA) and High-avoidance (RHA) rat lines/strains constitute a genetic model of differential anxiety. Relative to RHA rats, RLA rats exhibit enhanced anxiety/fearfulness, augmented hippocampal/amygdala c-Fos expression following exposure to novelty/conflict, increased hippocampal neuronal density and higher endocrine responses to stress. Neonatal handling (NH) is an environmental treatment with long-lasting anxiety/stress-reducing effects in rodents. Since hippocampus and amygdala volume are supposed to be related to anxiety/fear, we hypothesized a greater volume of both areas in RLA than in RHA rats, as well as that NH treatment would reduce anxiety and the volume of both structures, in particular in the RLA strain. Adult untreated and NH-treated RHA and RLA rats were tested for anxiety, sensorimotor gating (PPI), stress-induced corticosterone and prolactin responses, two-way active avoidance acquisition and in vivo 7 T 1H-Magnetic resonance image. As expected, untreated RLA rats showed higher anxiety and post-stress hormone responses, as well as greater hippocampus and amygdala volumes than untreated RHA rats. NH decreased anxiety/stress responses, especially in RLA rats, and significantly reduced hippocampus and amygdala volumes in this strain. Dorsal striatum volume was not different between the strains nor it was affected by NH. Finally, there were positive associations (as shown by correlations, factor analysis and multiple regression) between anxiety and PPI and hippocampus/amygdala volumes.

AB  - Prolonged stress triggers neuroinflammation, which plays a significant role in the development of depression; however, stressed people do not always suffer from depression because of individual differences in stress vulnerability. Negative cognitive bias (NCB) toward pessimistic judgment often underlies depressive episodes. However, a relationship between stress vulnerability, neuroinflammation, and NCB remains elusive. In addition, an animal model with all the traits would be a powerful tool for studying the etiology of depression and its therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, this study evaluated the effect of stress vulnerability on neuroinflammation and depression-related behaviors, including NCB in males, using a modified version of repeated social defeat stress (mRSDS) paradigm, a validated animal model of psychosocial stress. Exposure to mRSDS, consisting of 5 min of social defeat by unfamiliar CD-1 aggressor mice for five consecutive days, caused NCB, which co-occurred with depressive-and anxiety-like behaviors, and neuroinflammation in male BALB/c mice. Treatment with minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory property, blocked mRSDS-induced depressive-like behaviors and neuroinflammation, but not NCB, indicating the limited effect of an anti-inflammatory intervention. In addition, marked differences were found in neuroinflammatory profiles and hippocampal gene expression patterns between resilient and unstressed mice, as well as between susceptible and resilient mice. Therefore, mice resilient to mRSDS are indeed not intact. Our findings provide insights into the unique features of the mRSDS model in male BALB/c mice, which could be used to investigate the etiological mechanisms underlying depression as well as bridge the gap in the relationship between stress vulnerability, neuroinflammation, and NCB in males.

AB  - Experimental models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been utilized to characterize the behavioral derangements associated with brain trauma. Several studies exist characterizing motor function in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury model of TBI, but less research has focused on how CCI affects exploratory behavior. The goal of this study was to characterize deficits in three novelty exploration tasks after the CCI. Under anesthesia, 37 adult male Sprague Dawley rats received CCI (2.7 mm and 2.9 mm; 4 m/sec) over the right parietal cortex or sham surgery. For days 1-6 post-surgery, the beam balance and beam walking tasks were used to assess motor deficits. The Open Field, Y-Maze, and Free Choice Novelty (FCN) tasks were used to measure exploratory deficits from days 7-14 post-surgery. Injured rats displayed a significant, but transient, deficit on each motor task (p < 0.0001). Open Field results showed that injured rats had lower activity levels than shams (p < 0.0001), displayed less habituation to the task, and had more anxiety related behaviors ( thigmotaxis) across days (p < 0.0001). Y-maze results suggest that injured rats spent less time in the novel arm versus the familiar arms when compared to shams (p < 0.0001). For FCN, injured rats were less active (p < 0.05) and spent less time and had fewer interactions with objects in the novel environment compared to shams (p < 0.05). These results suggest that several ethological factors contribute to exploratory deficits after CCI and can be effectively characterized with the behavioral tasks described. Future work will utilize these tasks to evaluate the neural substrates underlying exploratory deficits after TBI.

AB  - Background: Studies of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in laboratory rodents have raised hopes for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases and mood disorders, as AHN can be modulated by physical exercise, stress and environmental changes in these animals. Since it is not known whether cell proliferation and neurogenesis in wild living mice can be experimentally changed, this study investigates the responsiveness of AHN to voluntary running and to environmental change in wild caught long-tailed wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus).
   Results: Statistical analyses show that running had no impact on cell proliferation ( p = 0.44), neurogenesis ( p = 0.94) or survival of newly born neurons ( p = 0.58). Likewise, housing in the laboratory has no effect on AHN. In addition, interindividual differences in the level of neurogenesis are not related to interindividual differences of running wheel performance (r(s) = -0.09, p = 0.79). There is a correlation between the number of proliferating cells and the number of cells of neuronal lineage ( rs = 0.63, p < 0.001) and the number of pyknotic cells (r(s) = 0.5, p = 0.009), respectively.
   Conclusion: Plasticity of adult neurogenesis is an established feature in strains of house mice and brown rats. Here, we demonstrate that voluntary running and environmental changes which are effective in house mice and brown rats cannot influence AHN in long-tailed wood mice. This indicates that in wild long-tailed wood mice different regulatory mechanisms act on cell proliferation and neurogenesis. If this difference reflects a species-specific adaptation or a broader adaptive strategy to a natural vs. domestic environment is unknown.

AB  - The importance of integrative biobehavioral responses to complex challenges cannot be overlooked. In this study, the synergetic effects of icariin (a flavonoid present in the plant Epimedium brevicornum), natural enrichment (NaEn), and play behavior were investigated. Rats (n = 60) were assigned to standard housing or NaEn; these two groups were subsequently divided into controls, rats receiving icariin treatments, and rats receiving icariin and allowed to play with an individual from another cage. All rats were exposed to unpredictable mild stressors for 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment, a Forced Swim Task (FST) was conducted to assess emotional regulation during an inescapable acute challenge. Biological samples were collected weekly and before and after the FST to monitor endocrine changes. Corticosterone (CORT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone (T) were assayed. We found that icariin had a significant effect on DHEA/CORT ratios and T levels. NaEn also had a significant effect on both CORT and DHEA, but not on T levels. Play did not appear to be significantly related to the endocrine changes. The strongest positive effects on emotional resilience were observed in NaEn rats that also received icariin. Our results confirmed that using multiple channels to stimulate adaptive responses can be effective in increasing the ability of an organism to face uncertainty. Considering how quickly our life can change due to unpredictable events, our data is instrumental to a better comprehension of the many aspects of integrative biobehavioral responses.

AB  - Diet board (DB) feeding aims to reduce the health hazards associated with ad libitum (AL) feeding. Rats, have to gnaw wood to detach food from the DB, reducing their food consumption. We studied the welfare effects of DB by measuring faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM), elevated plus-maze (EPM) behaviour and cage behaviour. In this two-year experiment, 147 group housed (n = 3) Hsd:Sprague Dawley (R) male and female rats were subjected to DB or AL feeding. DB feeding in females elevated FCMs and increased eating observations by 85%. The DB males were observed eating 30% more often and resting 4.2% less than their AL counterparts. The DB rats of both sexes had 19% increased cage exploration during daytime and 20% reduced grooming during night-time compared to the AL rats. The increased FCMs may indicate slight stress in DB females. The EPM results indicate there was no anxiety due to DB feeding at six months. The cage behaviour could point to mild chronic stress in DB rats, but the lack of effect on escape-related behaviour and agonism suggests that there were no substantial welfare problems. DB feeding did not seem to disturb the circadian rhythm. The smaller food requirements of DB females meant they had to sacrifice less time than males gnawing at the DB to satisfy their appetite.

AB  - In this study, which was conducted to investigate the growth performances of male Sprague-Dawley rats grown in different group sizes and changes that occurred in their oxidative statuses, 60 male 4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Two different cages with different dimensions were used, and 4 rats were put into each of the small cages, while 6 were put into each of the large cages. The trial was carried out with 6 replications. The rats were weighed each week for one month on the same day and at the same hour, and the average cage values were recorded. It was determined that the live weights showed a regular increase in both groups, and the growth performances did not differ based on group size. Group size was highly effective on the antioxidant components of the rats, and growing the rats in more crowded environments led to oxidative stress by changing their Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) (p<0.05), Total Oxidant Capacity (TOC) (p<0.05), Nitric Oxide (NO) (p<0.001), glutathione (GSH) (p<0.0001) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p<0.001) levels. In the light of the data obtained, it was concluded that, when dense rat breeding is carried out to achieve more production from a unit area, even though no changes occur in the morphological structures of the animals, their oxidant balance is disrupted. This prevents obtaining accurate and reliable data in scientific studies. Consequently, it was determined that group size is a criterion that needs to be kept in mind in selection of rats to be used in scientific studies, and the appropriate group size should be provided for these animals.

AB  - The discovery of new neurons being produced in the brains of adult mammals (adult brain neurogenesis) began a quest to determine the function(s) of these cells. Major hypotheses in the field have assumed that these neurons play pivotal role, in particular, in learning and memory phenomena, mood control, and epileptogenesis. In our studies summarized herein, we used cyclin D2 knockout (KO) mice, as we have shown that cyclin D2 is the key factor in adult brain neurogenesis and thus its lack produces profound impairment of the process. On the other hand, developmental neurogenesis responsible for the brain formation depends only slightly on cyclin D2, as the mutants display minor structural abnormalities, such as smaller hippocampus and more severe disturbances in the structure of the olfactory bulbs. Surprisingly, the studies have revealed that cyclin D2 KO mice did not show major deficits in several behavioral paradigms assessing hippocampal learning and memory. Furthermore, missing adult brain neurogenesis affected neither action of antidepressants, nor epileptogenesis. On the other hand, minor deficits observed in cyclin D2 KO mice in fine tuning of cognitive functions, species-typical behaviors and alcohol consumption might be explained by a reduced hippocampal size and/or other developmentally driven brain impairments observed in these mutant mice. In aggregate, surprisingly, missing almost entirely adult brain neurogenesis produces only very limited behavioral phenotype that could be attributed to the consequences of the development-dependent minor brain abnormalities.

AB  - Adaptations to the ever changing social and physical environment are necessary, sometimes involving the stress response. Olfaction is a chemical sense allowing the detection of molecules in the air, and many species rely on it for social recognition and fundamental functions such as feeding or reproduction. This non-exhaustive literature review addresses three topics at the intersection of sensory biology and stress biology, in order to raise awareness and enlighten our understanding of animal behaviour. First, we show that stress and associated emotions, such as fear, can alter odour perception, from the sensor (peripheral nervous system) to the interpretation of the sensory input (brain). This can be of relevance for understanding the behavioural consequences of negative experiences and depression-like states. Second, odours involved in animal chemical communication can signal danger in the form of predators or stressed conspecifics, and in turn induce stress in recipient animals, as a form of chemical empathy. Finally, we review some of the evidence for the use of odours as stress-relief agents. There is no clear evidence of treatment efficacy and it might be that under the labels of inhalation aromatherapy, aromachology or pheromone therapy, a lack of perspective has led to the conflation of various biological phenomena: an alleged spontaneous olfactory effect on stress relief, environmental enrichment or the recall of positive emotional states. Careful experimental design and critical analysis are paramount to clearly evaluate this promising intervention. The world around us shapes our emotions, which in turn affect our perception. There might be a huge animal welfare potential to harvest from improved knowledge in the studies of stress and olfaction interactions, this will eventually allow us to show more empathy to animals in our care.

AB  - Adolescents are highly motivated to engage in social interactions, and researchers have hypothesized that positive social relationships during adolescence can have long term, beneficial effects on stress reactivity and mental well-being. Studies of laboratory rodents provide the opportunity to investigate the relationship between early social experiences and later behavioral and physiological responses to stressors. In this study, female Lister-hooded rats (N = 12 per group) were either (a) provided with short, daily encounters (10 min/day) with a novel partner during mid-adolescence (postnatal day 34-45; "social experience," SE, subjects) or (b) underwent the same protocol with a familiar cagemate during mid-adolescence ("control experience," CE, subjects), or (c) were left undisturbed in the home cage (non-handled "control," C, subjects). When tested in adulthood, the groups did not differ in behavioral responses to novel environments (elevated plus maze, open field, and light-dark box) or in behavioral and physiological (urinary corticosterone) responses to novel social partners. However, SE females emitted significantly more 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations than control subjects both before and after social separation from a familiar social partner, which is consistent with previous findings in male rats. Thus, enhanced adolescent social experience appears to have long-term effects on vocal communication and could potentially modulate adult social relationships.

AB  - Repeated exposure to stress precipitates anxiety, depression and cognitive deficits. Stress-induced activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is modulated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). It is well established that BLA positively regulates the HPA axis and undergoes hypertrophy following chronic immobilization stress (CIS). However, it is not known whether inactivation of the BLA can modulate the stress-induced changes in the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the PFC. To address this, we stereologically estimated GR(+) cell densities in the prelimbic (PrL) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Following ibotenate lesioning of the BLA, rats were subjected to CIS and GR(+) cell densities were assessed. CIS increases the GR(+) cell densities in PrL and ACC. BLA lesion prior to CIS abolished the CIS-induced increase in GR(+) cell densities in both regions. In the second part of experiments, we evaluated whether selective inactivation of BLA during CIS would mimic the effects of BLA lesion. Interestingly, the BLA inactivation specifically during CIS prevented the increase in GR(+) cell densities in the PrL and ACC. The findings of our study suggest that BLA regulates the stress-induced increase in prefrontal GR expression, which might be crucial in the emergence of affective and cognitive symptoms following stress. We speculate that modulation of BLA during stress might prevent HPA axis dysfunctions and GR resistance in stress-related disorders, and could assist in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat stress and associated disorders like depression. Further, molecular studies are warranted for the understanding of stress-induced GR resistance and its prevention via BLA inactivation.

AB  - Mice are social animals hence group-housing of mice is preferred over individual housing. However, aggression in group-housed male mice under laboratory housing conditions is a well-known problem leading to serious health issues, including injury or death. Therefore, group-housed mice are frequently separated for welfare reasons. In this study, we investigated the effect of 3 different handling methods (tail, forceps, tube) in 2 different housing conditions (single vs. group) on the variance of aggression-associated parameters in male C57BL/6NCrl mice over 8 weeks. Blood glucose concentration, body weight, body temperature, plus number and severity of bite wounds and barbering intensity in group-housed mice were recorded. An assessment of nest complexity was also performed weekly. Feces were collected in week 3 and 7 for analysis of corticosterone metabolites. We also monitored the level of aggression by recording the behavior of group-housed animals after weekly cage cleaning. An open field test followed by a social novel object test, a light/dark box test, a hotplate and a resident-intruder test were performed at the end of the 8-week handling period. Post-mortem, we assessed organ weights. We found that forceps-handled mice, independent of the housing condition, had significantly higher levels of stress-induced-hyperthermia and enhanced aggression after cage cleaning, and they performed worse in the nest complexity test. In addition, handling male mice by the tail seems to be most effective to reduce aggressiveness after transferring animals into new cages, thereby representing an appropriate refinement.

AB  - Recent developments in the study of animal cognition and emotion have resulted in the 'judgement bias' model of animal welfare. Judgement biases describe the way in which changes in affective state are characterized by changes in information processing. In humans, anxiety and depression are characterized by increased expectation of negative events and negative interpretation of ambiguous information. Positive wellbeing is associated with enhanced expectation of positive outcomes and more positive interpretation of ambiguous information. Mood-congruent judgement biases for ambiguous information have been demonstrated in a range of animal species, with large variation in the way tests are administered and in the robustness of analyses. We highlight and address some issues using a laboratory species not previously tested: the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Hamsters were tested using a spatial judgement go/no-go task in enriched and unenriched housing. We included a number of controls and additional behavioural tests and applied a robust analytical approach using linear mixed effects models. Hamsters approached the ambiguous cues significantly more often when enriched than unenriched. There was no effect of enrichment on responses to the middle cue. We discuss these findings in light of mechanisms underlying processing cues to reward, punishment and true ambiguity, and the implications for the welfare of laboratory hamsters.

AB  - From the preference of one good over another, the strength of the preference cannot automatically be inferred. While money is the common denominator to assess the value of goods in humans, it appears difficult at first glance to put a price tag on the decisions of laboratory animals. Here we used consumer demand tests to measure how much work female mice expend to obtain access to different liquids. The mice could each choose between two liquids, one of which was free. The amount of work required to access the other liquid, by contrast, increased daily. In this way, the value of the liquid can be determined from a mouse's microeconomic perspective. The unique feature is that our test was carried out in a home-cage based setup. The mice lived in a group but could individually access the test-cage, which was connected to the home-cage via a gate. Thereby the mice were able to perform their task undisturbed by group members and on a self-chosen schedule with minimal influence by the experimenter. Our results show that the maximum number of nosepokes depends on the liquids presented. Mice worked incredibly hard for access to water while a bitter-tasting solution was offered for free whereas they made less nosepokes for sweetened liquids while water was offered for free. The results demonstrate that it is possible to perform automated and home-cage based consumer demand tests in order to ask the mice not only what they like best but also how strong their preference is.

AB  - Sleep loss strongly affects brain function and may even predispose susceptible individuals to psychiatric disorders. Since a recurrent lack of sleep frequently occurs during adolescence, it has been implicated in the rise in depression incidence during this particular period of life. One mechanism through which sleep loss may contribute to depressive symptomatology is by affecting hippocampal function. In this study, we examined the effects of sleep loss on hippocampal integrity at young age by subjecting adolescent male rats to chronic sleep restriction (SR) for 1 month from postnatal day 30 to 61. They were placed in slowly rotating drums for 20 h per day and were allowed 4 h of rest per day at the beginning of the light phase. Anxiety was measured using an open field and elevated plus maze test, while saccharine preference was used as an indication of anhedonia. All tests were performed after 1 and 4 weeks of SR. We further studied effects of SR on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, and at the end of the experiment, brains were collected to measure hippocampal volume and neurogenesis. Behavior of the SR animals was not affected, except for a transient suppression of saccharine preference after 1 week of SR. Hippocampal volume was significantly reduced in SR rats compared to home cage and forced activity controls. This volume reduction was not paralleled by reduced levels of hippocampal neurogenesis and could neither be explained by elevated levels of glucocorticoids. Thus, our results indicate that insufficient sleep may be a causal factor in the reductions of hippocampal volume that have been reported in human sleep disorders and mood disorders. Since changes in HPA activity or neurogenesis are not causally implicated, sleep disturbance may affect hippocampal volume by other, possibly more direct mechanisms. (C) 2011 IBRO.

AB  - Depression is a common psychiatric disorder that has been poorly understood. Consequently, current antidepressant agents have clinical limitations. Until today, most have exhibited the slow onset of therapeutic action and, more importantly, their effect on remission has been minimal. Thus, the need to find new forms of therapeutic intervention is urgent. The inflammation hypothesis of depression is widely acknowledged and is one that theories the relationship between the function of the immune system and its contribution to the neurobiology of depression. In this research, we utilized an environmental isolation (El) approach as a valid animal model of depression, employing biochemical, molecular, and behavioral studies. The aim was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor on a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR 7) signaling pathway in a depressive rat model, and compare these actions to fluoxetine, a standard antidepressant agent. The behavioral analysis indicates that depression-related symptoms are reduced after acute administration of fluoxetine and, to a lesser extent, etanercept, and are prevented by enriched environment (EE) housing conditions. Experimental studies were conducted by evaluating immobility time in the force swim test and pleasant feeling in the sucrose preference test. The mRNA expression of the TLR 7 pathway in the hippocampus showed that TLR 7, MYD88, and TRAF6 were elevated in isolated rats compared to the standard group, and that acute treatment with an antidepressant and anti-inflammatory drugs reversed these effects. This research indicates that stressful events have an impact on behavioral well-being, TLR7 gene expression, and the TLR7 pathway. We also found that peripheral administration of etanercept reduces depressive-like behaviour in isolated rats: this could be due to the indirect modulation of the TLR7 pathway and other TLRs in the brain. Furthermore, fluoxetine treatment reversed depressive-like behaviour and molecularly modulated the expression of TLR7, suggesting that fluoxetine exerts antidepressant effects partially by modulating the TLR7 signaling pathway.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a tandem repeat expansion encoding an expanded tract of glutamines in the huntingtin protein. HD is progressive and manifests as psychiatric symptoms (including depression), cognitive deficits (culminating in dementia), and motor abnormalities (including chorea). Having reached the twentieth anniversary of the discovery of the "genetic stutter" which causes HD, we still lack sophisticated insight into why so many HD patients exhibit affective disorders such as depression at very early stages, prior to overt appearance of motor deficits. In this review, we will focus on depression as the major psychiatric manifestation of HD, discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis identified from animal models, and compare depression in HD patients with that of the wider gene-negative population. The discovery of depressive like behaviors as well as cellular and molecular correlates of depression in transgenic HD mice has added strong support to the hypothesis that the HD mutation adds significantly to the genetic load for depression. A key question is whether HD-associated depression differs from that in the general population. Whilst preclinical studies, clinical data, and treatment responses suggest striking similarities, there are also some apparent differences. We discuss various molecular and cellular mechanisms which may contribute to depression in HD, and whether they may generalize to other depressive disorders. The autosomal dominant nature of HD and the existence of models with excellent construct validity provide a unique opportunity to understand the pathogenesis of depression and associated gene environment interactions. Thus, understanding the pathogenesis of depression in HD may not only facilitate tailored therapeutic approaches for HD sufferers, but may also translate to the clinical depression which devastates the lives of so many people.

AB  - Early life events induce alterations in neural function in adulthood. Although rearing in an enriched environment (EE) has a great impact on behavioral development, the effects of enriched rearing on sociosexual behavior remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of rearing in an EE on male copulatory behavior and its underlying neurobiological mechanisms in Wistar-Imamichi rats. Three-week-old, recently weaned rats were continuously subjected to a standard environment (SE) or an EE comprised of a large cage with several objects, such as toys, tunnels, ladders, and a running wheel. After 6 weeks, rats reared in an EE (EE rats) showed decreased sexual activity compared with rats reared in a SE (SE rats). This included a lower number of ejaculations and longer latencies in three consecutive copulatory tests. In addition, EE rats showed decreased emotional responsiveness and less locomotor behavior in an open field. In a runway test, on the other hand, sexual motivation toward receptive females in EE males was comparable to that of SE males. Furthermore, following exposure to a female, increases in serotonin levels in the nucleus accumbens and the striatum were significantly suppressed in EE males, whereas dopaminergic responses were similar between the groups. Female-exposure-induced increases in the levels of plasma corticosterone and testosterone were also suppressed in EE rats compared to SE rats. These data suggest that rearing in an EE decreases male copulatory behavior, and serotonin and hormonal regulating systems may regulate the differences in sociosexual interactions that result from distinct rearing environments.

AB  - In this study, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in behavioural profiles correlate to differences in stress-related behaviours and hormonal levels in captive brown capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus). Based on a sample of 25 animals, 143 h of behavioural data collection and 518 faecal samples, principal component analyses indicated the existence of four components that characterize the individuals' Genus Normative Behaviour (GNB) (KMO = 0.531, X-2 = 127.672, p < 0.001): 'Feeding', 'Sociability', 'Exploration', and 'Activity'. Other four components are related to stress coping styles (based on Behaviour Potentially Indicative of Stress - BPIS) (KMO = 0.550, X-2 = 329.303, p < 0.001): 'Self-directed'; 'Restless', 'Ingestion/Self-Scratching', and 'Stereotyped'. More active individuals exhibit rapid stress-related behaviours (r = 0.443; p = 0.044) while less active individuals exhibit more stationary stress-related behaviours (r = -0.519; p = 0.013). Akaike information criteria indicated that the best linear regression model to predict the physiological profile (Faecal Glucocorticoid Metabolites - FGM) included three GNB and three BPIS components. 'Sociability' (p < 0.05), 'Exploration' (p < 0.05), and 'Ingestion/Self-scratching' (p < 0.05) predicted lower FGM levels. 'Activity' (p < 0.05), 'Self-directed' (p < 0.05), and 'Stereotyped' (p < 0.05) predicted higher FGM levels. 'Feeding' and 'Restless' factors were not included in the models. Our results support previous studies indicating that animals within the same population differ in the way they behave and react to stressful conditions, and these are correlated to different physiological profiles. Mapping inter-individual differences in stress coping strategies may help clarify the long-term reported incongruity between behavioural and physiological indicators of welfare in captive animals, supporting better management practices and assisting translational models of the development of psychopathologies.

AB  - We studied the effects of variations in maternal environment on maternal behaviour and offspring memory in mice by exposing lactating C57BL/6J dams to predator cues and/or environmental enrichment. At 10 weeks of age, object recognition memory in the offspring was assessed. The presence of enrichment in the maternal environment had no effect on offspring memory. In contrast, female offspring of dams that were not exposed to predator cues displayed a significant preference for the novel object (p = 0.05) and a significantly higher preference score (PS) than female offspring of dams that were exposed to predator cues (F= 4.23, p = 0.05) indicating an impairment in object recognition memory in the latter. Conversely, there was no evidence of object recognition memory in male offspring, except for males of dams exposed to predator cues without shelter (p = 0.03). These effects can be explained by an interaction between variations in maternal care and the stressfulness of the rearing conditions since a regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the level of licking-grooming and the PS, but only in female offspring reared by dams exposed to the predator cues (beta = -0.96, p = 0.001). The present findings thus provide some evidence that early rearing conditions may affect cognitive abilities of mice. The data also suggest that these effects may be sex-specific, and that females may be more sensitive to early environmental variations than males. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rodent studies have revealed that the early rearing environment plays an important role in the development of stress vulnerability, memory and cognition. Although early lighting conditions (ELC) are involved in these neuronal developments through both maternal and offspring behavior, their influence has not been fully elucidated. Thus, by using Sprague-Dawley rats, we examined whether ELC affected maternal care by the dam and the subsequent neurodevelopment of the offspring. Prolonged dark phase conditions (PDC) (light/dark, 6/18 h) and prolonged light phase conditions (light/dark, 18/6 h) were administered from postnatal day 2 to postnatal day 14. Throughout this period, maternal care and the circadian rhythmicity of dams were investigated. In adolescence and adulthood of the offspring, we measured anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, object recognition memory, activity rhythm and corticosterone response to stress with hippocampal expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate and glucocorticoid receptor mRNAs. PDC altered maternal care and circadian rhythmicity in the dam compared with normal lighting conditions and prolonged light phase conditions. PDC markedly increased anxiety-like behavior, decreased social interaction and object recognition memory, and inhibited corticosterone feedback in offspring later in life. Furthermore, hippocampal levels of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B mRNA in rats subjected to PDC were significantly lower than in animals subjected to normal lighting conditions. In the adult offspring, the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity was not affected. These findings suggested that ELC affect mother-infant interactions and subsequently at least partially alter the neurobehavioral development of offspring.

AB  - It is well known that regular low or mild exercise helps to improve and maintain cognition. On the other hand, ever thought many people prefer high-intensity exercise (e.g., running, swimming, biking, soccer, basketball, etc.) to get rid of stress or improve their health, the previous studies reported that intense exercise either impairs cognition or has no effect on cognitive function. However, we previously showed that intermittent intense exercise prevents stress-induced depressive behavior in mice in a similar manner to moderate exercise. On the basis of this finding, we investigated the effect of intermittent intense exercise on cognitive deficit in chronically stressed mice. A total of forty mice were evenly divided into control, stressed, stressed with moderate exercise, and stressed with intense exercise groups. The stressed mice were chronically exposed a restraint stress (10 h/day, 6 days/week for 7 weeks). The exercised mice were subjected to intermittent intense or endurance moderate running on the treadmill three times a week. Cognition was evaluated using the Morris water maze test and the object recognition test. Chronic stress decreased cognition, and newborn cell survival and blood vessel density in the hippocampus. However, both regular intense and moderate exercise prevented decrease of cognition, improved newborn cell survival and blood vessel density. These findings suggest that intermittent intense exercise may protect against decrease of cognition in a similar manner to moderate exercise and that both exercise-induced protection of decrease of cognition is closely related to newborn cell survival and angiogenesis in the hippocampus.

AB  - The recent growth of research on animal personality could provide new insights into our understanding of sociality and the structure of animal groups. Although simple assays of the type commonly used to study animal personality have been shown to correlate with social aggressiveness in some bird species, conflicting empirical results do not yet make it clear when such assays, typically using isolated individuals, predict behaviour within social groups. We measured aggressiveness in groups of a very gregarious species, the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), and performed five commonly used behavioural assays on the same individuals: tonic immobility, mirror test, novel object test, open-field test and a variant of the latter in an enriched environment. We found that larger individuals were more dominant and that differences in aggressiveness were repeatable. None of the traditional behavioural assays were related to aggressiveness or dominance. Standard personality assays may fail to capture individual differences relevant to predict social behaviour, and we discuss biological and methodological explanations for these results, such as social behaviour being in part an emergent property of groups rather than an intrinsic property of individuals, or gregarious species being particularly sensitive to the conditions of standard personality assays that test individuals alone.

AB  - Indicators of environmental adequacy relevant to the well-being of small felids are developed by examining, in 4 captive leopard cats, interrelationships between behavioral and adrenocortical responses to changes in housing conditions. Singly housed cats were moved from their barren home cage (Cage 1, baseline) sequentially to 2 new, barren housing situations (Cages 2 and 3; almost-equal-to 10 weeks/cage). Urinary cortisol concentrations, stereotypic pacing, and hiding frequencies were transiently increased for 1 week after translocation to Cage 2. After translocation to Cage 3, cortisol concentrations and hiding also were increased for the first week. However, conditions in Cage 3 were determined to be aversive to the cats, as evidenced by cortisol concentrations that remained chronically elevated for the entire 10-week period. Exploratory behavior was suppressed during this period. When Cage 3 was enriched with a complex of branches and hiding places, urinary cortisol concentrations and stereotypic pacing decreased, and exploration increased. Concealment locations that camouflage were more often used for lying down when urinary cortisol was elevated. These results suggest that reduced exploratory behavior is an indicator of chronic exposure to aversive environmental conditions. Stereotypic pacing may not necessarily increase when adrenocortical activity increases. The results also suggest that enrichment facilitates coping with aversive stimulation by providing behavioral options to confined felids. To promote the welfare of small felids, appropriate camouflaged hiding places should be provided and enrichment programs developed to stimulate exploratory behavior. (C) 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Passerine birds are important models in fundamental biological research, with as many as 300,000 individuals used in laboratory experiments worldwide annually. However, because the use of passerines is rare compared with that of more conventional laboratory animals, there is often a lack of information about the basic biology and husbandry requirements of these species. We aim to address this deficit by providing an overview of the most salient aspects of passerine biology and their implications for laboratory husbandry and welfare. We start by describing the characteristics that make these birds useful and interesting research subjects. Specifically, we highlight features (e.g., birdsong) of passerine biology that differentiate these birds from more common laboratory animals. Next, we consider the implications of passerine biology for husbandry in the laboratory. Many of the aspects of passerine biology that make these species valuable to scientists are also likely to be affected by environmental variables; a good knowledge of these variables is necessary in order to choose appropriate laboratory conditions for passerines. We outline how the developmental history of the birds and choices of caging, feeding, and environmental regimes might influence their physiology and behavior and thus affect both the welfare of the birds and the quality of the resulting data. We stress the importance of a sound understanding of the biology of any species to ensure good welfare and good science.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   To determine the effect of different types of classical music played during a veterinary visit on dog behavior and owner satisfaction.
   DESIGN
   Prospective randomized controlled study.
   ANIMALS
   74 dogs examined at a veterinary teaching hospital.
   PROCEDURES
   Dogs examined for a wellness visit, presurgical health evaluation, or non-urgent illness were exposed to 1 of 3 treatments (modified classical music, the same music in its original format, and no music [control]) while in the examination room. Owners completed a standardized survey regarding the dog's behavior and their satisfaction with the visit. Clinicians completed a separate standardized survey regarding the dog's behavior. Information regarding monetary charges, procedures performed, diagnoses, and physiologic variables was obtained from the electronic medical record after the appointment.
   RESULTS
   Owners rated their dog's anxiety level in the waiting room greater than that in the examination room regardless of treatment. Mean anxiety and aggression scores of dogs during the physical examination as rated by owners were significantly greater than those assigned by clinicians. Visit satisfaction for owners exposed to original classical music was significantly greater than that for owners not exposed to music.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Results suggested placing a pet and its owner into an examination room instead of a waiting room immediately after clinic arrival may ameliorate pet anxiety during the veterinary visit. Playing classical music at a low volume can be a simple and cost-effective way to improve owner satisfaction with the veterinary visit. Further research is necessary to determine the effects of music on pet anxiety.

AB  - To date, clinical trials have failed to find an effective therapy for victims of traumatic brain injury (TBI) who live with motor, cognitive, and psychiatric complaints. Pre-clinical investigators are now encouraged to include male and female subjects in all translational research, which is of particular interest in the field of neurotrauma given that circulating female hormones (progesterone and estrogen) have been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects. To determine whether behavior of male and female C57BL6/J mice is differentially impaired by TBI, male and cycling female mice were injured by controlled cortical impact and tested for several weeks with functional assessments commonly employed in pre-clinical research. We found that cognitive and motor impairments post-TBI, as measured by the Morris water maze (MWM) and rotarod, respectively, were largely equivalent in male and female animals. However, spatial working memory, assessed by the y-maze, was poorer in female mice. Female mice were generally more active, as evidenced by greater distance traveled in the first exposure to the open field, greater distance in the y-maze, and faster swimming speeds in the MWM. Statistical analysis showed that variability in all behavioral data was no greater in cycling female mice than it was in male mice. These data all suggest that with careful selection of tests, procedures, and measurements, both sexes can be included in translational TBI research without concern for effect of hormones on functional impairments or behavioral variability.

AB  - Behavioral profiles are influenced by both positive and negative experiences as well as the genetic disposition. Traditionally, accumulating adversity over lifetime is considered to predict increased anxiety like behavior ("allostatic load"). The alternative "mismatch hypothesis" suggests increased levels of anxiety if the early environment differs from the later-life environment. Thus, there is a need for a whole-life history approach to gain a deeper understanding of how behavioral profiles are shaped. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of life history on the behavioral profile of mice varying in serotonin transporter (5-HIT) genotype, an established mouse model of increased anxiety-like behavior. For this purpose, mice grew up under either adverse or beneficial conditions during early phases of life. In adulthood, they were further subdivided so as to face a situation that either matched or mismatched the condition experienced so far, resulting in four different life histories. Subsequently, mice were tested for their anxiety-like and exploratory behavior. The main results were: (1) Life history profoundly modulated the behavioral profile. Surprisingly, mice that experienced early beneficial and later escapable adverse conditions showed less anxiety-like and more exploratory behavior compared to mice of other life histories. (2) Genotype significantly influenced the behavioral profile, with homozygous 5-HTT knockout mice displaying highest levels of anxiety-like and lowest levels of exploratory behavior. Our findings concerning life history indicate that the absence of adversity does not necessarily cause lower levels of anxiety than accumulating adversity. Rather, some adversity may be beneficial, particularly when following positive events. Altogether, we conclude that for an understanding of behavioral profiles, it is not sufficient to look at experiences during single phases of life, but the whole life history has to be considered.

AB  - Experimental evidence suggests that environmental stress conditions can alter the expression of BDNF and that the expression of this neurotrophin influences behavioural responses in mammalian models. It has been recently demonstrated that exposure to 34 degrees C for 21 days alters the brain proteome and behaviour in zebrafish. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of BDNF in the nervous system of adult zebrafish under control and heat treatment conditions. For this purpose, zebrafish from three different genotypes (wild type, heterozygous BDNF+/- and knock out BDNF-/-) were kept for 21 days at 26 degrees C or 34 degrees C and then euthanized for brain molecular analyses or subjected to behavioural tests (Y-maze test, novel tank test, light and dark test, social preference test, mirror biting test) for assessing behavioural aspects such as boldness, anxiety, social preference, aggressive behaviour, interest for the novel environment and exploration. qRT-PCR analysis showed the reduction of gene expression of BDNF and its receptors after heat treatment in wild type zebrafish. Moreover, proteomic analysis and behavioural tests showed genotype- and temperature-dependent effects on brain proteome and behavioural responding. Overall, the absent expression of BDNF in KO alters (1) the brain proteome by reducing the expression of proteins involved in synapse functioning and neurotransmitter-mediated transduction; (2) the behaviour, which can be interpreted as bolder and less anxious and (3) the cellular and behavioural response to thermal treatment.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined links between postnatal neurogenesis and depression using a range of experimental methods to deplete neurogenesis. The antimitotic drug temozolomide (TMZ) has previously been used successfully as an experimental tool in animals to deplete adult neurogenesis and is used regularly on human patients as a standard chemotherapy for brain cancer. In this study, we wanted to evaluate whether TMZ as a model for chemotherapy treatment could affect parameters related to depression in an animal model. Prevalence rates of depression in patients is thought to be highly underdiagnosed, with some studies reporting rates as high as 90%. Results from this study in mice, treated with a regimen of TMZ similar to humans, exhibited behavioural and biochemical changes that have relevance to the development of depression. In particular, behavioural results demonstrated robust deficits in processing novelty and a significant increase in the corticosterone response. Quantification of neurogenesis using a novel sectioning method, which clearly evaluates dorsal and ventral neurogenesis separately, showed a significant correlation between the level of ventral neurogenesis and the corticosterone response. Depression is a complex disorder with discoveries regarding its neurobiology and how it relates to behaviour being only in their infancy. The findings presented in this study demonstrate that chemotherapy-induced decreases in neurogenesis results in previously unreported behavioural and biochemical consequences. These results, we argue, are indicative of a biological mechanism, which may contribute to the development of depression in patients being treated with chemotherapy and is separate from the mental distress resulting from a cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Behavioural tests to assess affective states are widely used in human research and have recently been extended to animals. These tests assume that affective state influences cognitive processing, and that animals in a negative affective state interpret ambiguous information as expecting a negative outcome (displaying a negative cognitive bias). Most of these tests however, require long discrimination training. The aim of the study was to validate an exploration based cognitive bias test, using two different handling methods, as previous studies have shown that standard tail handling of mice increases physiological and behavioural measures of anxiety compared to cupped handling. Therefore, we hypothesised that tail handled mice would display a negative cognitive bias. We handled 28 female CD-1 mice for 16 weeks using either tail handling or cupped handling. The mice were then trained in an eight arm radial maze, where two adjacent arms predicted a positive outcome (darkness and food), while the two opposite arms predicted a negative outcome (no food, white noise and light). After six days of training, the mice were also given access to the four previously unavailable intermediate ambiguous arms of the radial maze and tested for cognitive bias. We were unable to validate this test, as mice from both handling groups displayed a similar pattern of exploration. Furthermore, we examined whether maze exploration is affected by the expression of stereotypic behaviour in the home cage. Mice with higher levels of stereotypic behaviour spent more time in positive arms and avoided ambiguous arms, displaying a negative cognitive bias. While this test needs further validation, our results indicate that it may allow the assessment of affective state in mice with minimal training-a major confound in current cognitive bias paradigms.

AB  - Neurogenesis in the dentate gyms (DG) of the hippocampus is increased by spatial learning and postnatal stimulation. Conversely, prenatal stress (PS) produces a decrease in the proliferation of hippocampal granular cells. This work evaluated the effect of postnatal tactile stimulation (PTS), when applied from birth to adulthood, on cognitive performance and hippocampal neurogenesis (survival and differentiation) in PS female and male rats. The response of the adrenal axis to training in the Morris water maze (MWM) was also analyzed. PS was provided during gestational days 15 through 21. Hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive performance in the MWM were assessed at an age of three months. Results showed that escape latencies of both female and male PS rats were longer compared to those of their controls (CON). DG cell survival increased in the PS female rats. Corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in the male and female PS rats after MWM training. PTS improved escape latencies and increased the number of new neurons in the DG of PS animals, and their corticosterone concentrations were similar to those in CON. In CON, PTS diminished DG cell survival but increased differentiation and reduces latency in the MWM. These results show that long-term PTS in PS animals might prevent learning deficits in adults through increase in the number of DG new cells and decrease of the reactivity of the adrenal axis to MWM training.

AB  - Human personality may substantially affect the nature of care provided to dependants. This link has been well researched in parents and children, however, relatively little is known about this dynamic with regards to humans' relationships with non-human animals. Owner interactions with companion animals may provide valuable insight into the wider phenomenon of familial interactions, as owners usually adopt the role of primary caregiver and potentially surrogate parent. This study, using cats as an exemplar, explored the relationship between owner personality and the lifestyles to which cats are exposed. In addition, it explored owner personality as it related to reported cat behaviour and wellbeing. Cat owners (n = 3331) responded to an online survey examining their personality and the health, behaviour and management of their cats. Owner personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory (BFI) to assess: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Neuroticism and Openness. Owners also provided information concerning the physical health, breed type, management and behavioural styles of their cats. Generalised linear mixed models were used to identify relationships between owner personality and a range of factors that may have welfare implications for the wider companion animal population, and specifically, cats. Higher owner Neuroticism was associated with an increased likelihood of non-pedigree rather than pedigree cat ownership, a decreased likelihood of ad libitum access to the outdoors, cats being reported as having a 'behavioural problem', displaying more aggressive and anxious/fearful behavioural styles and more stress-related sickness behaviours, as well as having an ongoing medical condition and being overweight. Other owner personality traits were generally found to correlate more positively with various lifestyle, behaviour and welfare parameters. For example, higher owner Extroversion was associated with an increased likelihood that the cat would be provided ad libitum access to the outdoors; higher owner Agreeableness was associated with a higher level of owner reported satisfaction with their cat, and with a greater likelihood of owners reporting their cats as being of a normal weight. Finally higher owner Conscientiousness was associated with the cat displaying less anxious/fearful, aggressive, aloof/avoidant, but more gregarious behavioural styles. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between carer personality and the care received

AB  - This study examined the impact of rearing environment on the behavioural responses of wild European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to standard laboratory husbandry procedures. We compared birds that had been caught from the wild as independent juveniles with birds taken from the nest and hand-reared in the laboratory from approximately ten days post-hatch. Although hand-rearing can increase habituation to humans and hence reduce fearfulness in laboratory birds, in other species maternal deprivation is also associated with increased stress-sensitivity in later life. Thus, the welfare benefits of hand-rearing are unclear. We investigated the interaction between rearing environment (12 hand-reared versus 12 wild-caught birds) and current laboratory housing conditions (enriched versus non-enriched cages and top-level cages versus bottom-level cages) on measures of behaviour before, during and after husbandry. Both wild-caught and hand-reared birds reacted to focal husbandry by moving to the periphery of their cages, indicative of high escape motivation during a stressful procedure. Wild-caught birds were overall less active than hand-reared birds. We found no difference in the response of the wild-caught and hand-reared birds to focal husbandry, but hand-reared birds were faster to resume normal behaviour following husbandry than wild-caught birds when housed in the top cages. We interpret our results as showing evidence for chronic depressive apathy (lower overall activity) coupled with greater fear (longer latencies to resume normal behaviour following husbandry) in the wild-caught birds in some environments. Our data support the conclusion that hand-rearing is associated with some welfare benefits for birds involved in laboratory research.

AB  - The neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is critical in neural circuit function and behavior, particularly in the context of stress, anxiety, and addiction. Despite a wealth of preclinical evidence for the efficacy of CRF receptor 1 antagonists in reducing behavioral pathology associated with alcohol exposure, several clinical trials have had disappointing outcomes, possibly due to an underappreciation of the role of biological variables. Although he National Institutes of Health (NIH) now mandate the inclusion of sex as a biological variable in all clinical and preclinical research, the current state of knowledge in this area is based almost entirely on evidence from male subjects. Additionally, the influence of biological variables other than sex has received even less attention in the context of neuropeptide signaling. Age (particularly adolescent development) and housing conditions have been shown to affect CRF signaling and voluntary alcohol intake, and the interaction between these biological variables is particularly relevant to the role of the CRF system in the vulnerability or resilience to the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Going forward, it will be important to include careful consideration of biological variables in experimental design, reporting, and interpretation. As new research uncovers conditions in which sex, age, and environment play major roles in physiological and/or pathological processes, our understanding of the complex interaction between relevant biological variables and critical signaling pathways like the CRF system in the cellular and behavioral consequences of alcohol exposure will continue to expand ultimately improving the ability of preclinical research to translate to the clinic.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that tactile stimulation (TS) in pups is able to prevent and/or minimize fear, anxiety behaviors, and addiction to psychostimulant drugs in adult rats. In these studies, animals have been exposed to handling from postnatal day (PND) 1-21. This study was designed to precisely establish which period of preweaning development has a greater influence of TS on neuronal development. After birth, male pups were exposed to TS from PND1-7, PND8-14, and PND15-21. In adulthood, the different periods of postnatal TS were assessed through behavioral, biochemical, and molecular assessments. Animals that received TS from PND8-14 showed lower anxiety-like symptoms, as observed by decreased anxiety index in elevated plus maze. This same TS period was able to improve rats' working memory by increasing the percentage of alternation rate in Y-maze, and induce better ability to cope with stressful situations, as showed in the defensive burying test by a reduced time of burying behavior. On the other hand, animals receiving TS in the first week of life showed longest cumulative burying time, which is directly related to increased anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, TS from PND8-14 showed lower corticosterone levels and better oxidative status, as observed by decreased lipid peroxidation and increased catalase activity in the hippocampus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunocontent was increased in the hippocampus of animals receiving TS from PND8-14, while glucocorticoid receptors immunocontent was decreased in both TS1-7 and TS15-21, but not TS8-14. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show TS can be more efficient if applied over a focused period of neonatal development (PND8-14) and this beneficial influence can be reflected on reduced emotionality and increased ability to address stressful situations in adulthood.

AB  - Individual or singly-housing laboratory rats is common in many animal facilities, but has an adverse impact on the welfare of this social species. It has previously been shown that a small proportion of individually housed mice (similar to 5%) engage in pathological overgrooming behaviour, but this has not been assessed in rats. We performed an observational study to determine the prevalence of overgrooming-related self-injury and whether providing nesting material enrichment throughout an animal's life would affect the prevalence or severity of overgrooming-related self-injury. Due to protocol differences between projects in our behavioural neuroscience lab, unenriched rats received a nylabone and a shelter (n = 167), while baseline-enriched rats received a nylabone, shelter and shredded paper nesting material throughout experiments (n = 238). Unenriched rats received nesting material enrichment after the onset of overgrooming-related self-injury. Over 18 months, rats were monitored by their experimenters on a daily basis (5-7 days/week over 2-3 months/project) and any cases of overgrooming-related self-injury were recorded. Replicating the findings of previous studies in mice, we observed 20 cases of overgrooming-related self-injury (similar to 5%) with no difference in prevalence between rats on the basis of supplier, cage position, experimental procedure (behavioural only or involving surgical procedures), reinforcer (ethanol or sugar) or level of baseline-enrichment. While there was no difference in onset severity between rats that were unenriched at baseline and baseline-enriched rats, baseline-enriched rats had lower self-injury severity scores at one-, two- and four-week follow-ups. These results suggest that nesting material enrichment provided throughout an animal's life may reduce overgrooming-related self-injury.

AB  - Early maternal support has been shown to promote specific gene expression, neurogenesis, adaptive stress responses, and larger hippocampal volumes in developing animals. In humans, a relationship between psychosocial factors in early childhood and later amygdala volumes based on prospective data has been demonstrated, providing a key link between early experience and brain development. Although much retrospective data suggests a link between early psychosocial factors and hippocampal volumes in humans, to date there has been no prospective data to inform this potentially important public health issue. In a longitudinal study of depressed and healthy preschool children who underwent neuroimaging at school age, we investigated whether early maternal support predicted later hippocampal volumes. Maternal support observed in early childhood was strongly predictive of hippocampal volume measured at school age. The positive effect of maternal support on hippocampal volumes was greater in nondepressed children. These findings provide prospective evidence in humans of the positive effect of early supportive parenting on healthy hippocampal development, a brain region key to memory and stress modulation.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (ahNG) occurs in the human brain. Adult generated neurons have been proposed to functionally contribute to relevant hippocampal functions such as learning and memory, mood regulation, and stress response. Learning, environmental enrichment, and physical exercise exert positive effects on ahNG. In parallel, these proneurogenic stimuli have been shown to ameliorate cognitive performance and/or depressive-like behavior in animal models. Conversely, aging, social isolation, and chronic stress exert negative effects on ahNG. Interestingly, reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis is suggested to potentially contribute to cognitive decline and mood alterations associated with aging and several neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical observation demonstrates that patients affected by chronic pain often exhibit increased anxiety and depression, impaired cognitive flexibility, and memory capacities. As of today, our understanding of the molecular and cellular events that may underlie the comorbidity of chronic pain, depression, and cognitive impairment is limited. Herein we review recent preclinical data suggesting that chronic pain may induce profound changes in hippocampal plasticity, including reduced ahNG. We discuss the possibility that deregulated hippocampal neurogenesis in chronic pain may, at least in part, contribute to cognitive and mood alterations. Based on this hypothesis, the mechanisms underlying chronic pain-associated changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and related functions need to be addressed experimentally. One interesting feature of ahNG is its susceptibility to pharmacological modulation. Again, based on preclinical data we discuss the possibility that, at least in principle, distinct analgesic drugs commonly used in chronic pain states (typical and atypical opiates, a2d ligands, and acetyl-l-carnitine) may differentially impact ahNG and that this aspect could be taken into account to reduce and/or prevent the potential risk of cognitive and emotional side effects in the clinical setting.
