AB  - Social housing is recommended for laboratory rats because they are highly social mammals but research constraints or medical issues often demand individual housing and, when social housing is practiced, it typically involves housing with only one or two conspecifics. We hypothesized that playful social contact with humans (i.e. tickling), mimicking the dorsal contacts and pins characteristic of rat rough-and-tumble play, could act as a partial substitute for, or supplement to, conspecific social contact in situations when laboratory rats are housed individually or in pairs or triplets. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the beneficial effects of regular tickling when young would persist following discontinuation of tickling. Accordingly, we investigated the responses of juvenile male rats to handling conditions (minimally handled vs. tickled) and group size (singletons, pairs, triplets). We measured (a) production of 22- and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during a 1-min period before handling (interpreted as evidence for negative and positive affective states, respectively), (b) corticosterone levels from faecal pellets collected in the home cage, and pre- and post-treatment body weight (as measures of physiological stress), and (c) behaviour in an Open Field test (to assess anxiety). After 3 weeks of tickling for 2 min/day, individually-housed rats produced more 50-kHz USVs in anticipation of handling than their minimally-handled counterparts (P<0.0001). This effect persisted for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of the tickling programme (P<0.0001), when all rats were transferred to individual housing. Tickling experience also reduced anxiety-related behaviour of individually-housed rats in the Open Field test (P<0.05). Faecal corticosterone levels and body weight were not affected by tickling experience or group size, although both corticosterone levels and anxiety-related behaviour were elevated following re-housing (P<0.05). No significant differences were detected between rats housed as pairs or triplets for any of the measures investigated (P>0.05). Both the Open Field and USV data affirm that tickling is beneficial for rats, especially when housed individually, and provide evidence that specific experiences derived from playful contact contribute to the well-being of group-housed animals. We conclude that tickling is an appropriate cross-species social enrichment manoeuver that can promote the well-being of laboratory rats and rats kept as companion animals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations, activity, and personality were assessed for 35 fennec foxes (Vulpes zerda) to determine whether animals managed as ambassadors differed from exhibit or off-exhibit animals. A FGM assay, pedometer, and personality assessment tool were validated. Then, fecal samples and movement data were collected during winter and summer periods. Handling was recorded, and the personality of each fox was evaluated. Generalized linear mixed models assessed the relationships between FGM concentrations, activity, personality, handling, sex, season, rearing type, and role. FGM concentrations did not differ in relation to role or handling. Foxes were most active at night; the time of peak activity did not vary with role or handling. Foxes were more active in winter; males were more active than females, and ambassador foxes were more active than off-exhibit animals. Hand-reared foxes were more sociable, and, at one institution, ambassador foxes were more sociable than foxes in other roles. These results suggest that management for ambassador programs is not associated with changes in glucocorticoid production or circadian patterns but may increase activity and be associated with greater sociability.

AB  - It is well known that early life events induce long-lasting psychophysiological and psychobiological influences in later life. In rodent studies, environmental enrichment after weaning prevents the adulthood behavioral and emotional disturbances in response to early adversities. We compared the behavioral effect of neonatal isolation (NI) with the effect of NI accompanied by tactile stimulation (NTS) to determine whether NTS could reverse or prevent the effects of NI on the adulthood behavioral and emotional responses to environmental stimuli. In addition, we also examined the sex difference of the NTS effect. Measurements of body weights, an open-field locomotor test, an elevated plus maze test, a hot-plate test, and a contextual fear-conditioning test were performed on postnatal day 60. As compared with rats subjected to NI, rats subjected to NTS showed significantly higher activity and exploration in the open-field locomotor test, lower anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test, and significantly prolonged latencies in the hot-plate test, and this effect was equal among males and females. In the contextual fear-conditioning test, whereas NTS significantly reduced the enhanced freezing time due to NI in females, no significant difference in the freezing time between NI and NTS was found in males. These findings indicate that adequate tactile stimulation in early life plays an important role in the prevention of disturbances in the behavioral and emotional responses to environmental stimuli in adulthood induced by early adverse experiences.

AB  - Neonatal handling affects the response to repeated stress in a sexually dimorphic manner. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these gender-dependent effects, we investigated the consequences of neonatal androgenization and handling on adult stress reactivity by determining: (a) immobility time during repeated forced swimming, (b) plasma corticosterone levels, and (c) brain serotonin and dopamine levels and turnover after either repeated forced swimming, or repeated forced swimming followed by repeated restraint stress. In neonatally androgenized females, immobility time was lower in the handled than in the non-handled rats, a pattern resembling that of the males, suggesting that the sexually dimorphic effect of handling on immobility time can be attributed to the organizational effects of testosterone. No differences were found between anfemales and females injected neonatally with vehicle, indicating that the gender differences in circulating corticosterone are not due to the organizational effects of testosterone. The stress of a neonatal injection interacted with neonatal handling resulting in lower plasma corticosterone and hypothalamic dopamine and serotonin levels in the neonatally injected handled animals following repeated forced swimming. The serotonergic system appears to be sensitive to both the organizational actions of testosterone and the effects of handling, since handled androgenized females had higher serotonin levels and decreased turnover following repeated forced swimming stress, compared to those injected neonatally with vehicle. Handling resulted in increased hypothalamic and striatal serotonin levels in both males and females following repeated forced swimming. Our results reveal that handling has gender-dependent effects on adult hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and brain monoaminergic system reactivity to stress and that these effects can be attributed to both the organizational and activational effects of gonadal hormones.

AB  - Middle-aged 330-day-old male and female hooded rats were group-housed for nearly 5 months in either standard cages, or in cages containing objects. Each cage also provided either pure water, or a solution of vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate) for drinking. Records were kept of averages for each cage of the rats' body weights and the volume of fluid/100 g average body weight drunk. The average daily dose of tocopherol was approximately 162 and 173 mg/kg for males and females respectively. Males (but not females) kept in enriched cages weighed less than those from standard cages. They also drank less fluid than females who also drank more tocopherol solution than males. When 490+ days old, for rats provided with enrichment led to decreased open-field ambulation and increased within-session decrements in the water, response (habituation). Enrichment also led to decreased occupancy of the center of the apparatus for males only and, for all rats combined, increased grooming behavior. It was concluded that the effects of enrichment on aged rats were due to increased within-session habituation to novelty and decreased anxiety similar to what has been suggested for younger animals. Tocopherol appeared to interfere with effects of enrichment possibly because of pro-oxidant-related increased anxiety. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence is mounting that personality is associated with health and well-being in humans and other animals. In a step towards increasing our understanding of this link, we applied regulatory focus theory, a motivational perspective from social psychology, to the behavior of zoo-housed cotton top tamarins. We tested whether regulatory focus personality, that is stable differences in whether an individual is motivated by gains versus safety, would 1) produce individual differences in behavior and 2) predict how individuals interact with enrichment. First, we characterized individuals with respect to several key behaviors: eating in the open, hiding, and time spent near the front of the exhibit. The monkeys were consistent in their behavioral tendencies across the 6-month study, allowing regulatory focus classification. One monkey showed evidence of being a promotion-individual, that is, more motivated by gains than safety. One monkey showed evidence of being a prevention-individual, that is, more motivated by safety than gains. The other monkeys were stable in their behavior and showed evidence of being intermediate-individuals, that is, they favored neither gains nor safety. Using these characterizations, we predicted distinct patterns of individual-object interactions with enrichment. For example, we predicted that a promotion-individual (favoring gains over safety) would approach potential gains faster than a prevention-individual (favoring safety over gains). Counter-intuitively, however, we also predicted that a promotion-individual would approach non-gains slower than a prevention-individual concerned with safety. We found support for our predictions, which suggests that regulatory focus theory could be a useful tool for understanding how and why individuals interact with environmental enrichment.

AB  - Animals that experience adverse events in early life often have life-long changes to their physiology and behavior. Long-term effects of stress during early life have been studied extensively, but less attention has been given to the consequences of negative experiences solely during the adolescent phase. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period of life when regulation of the glucocorticoid "stress" hormone response matures and specific regions in the brain undergo considerable change. Aversive experiences during this time might, therefore, be expected to generate long-term consequences for the adult phenotype. Here we investigated the long-term effects of exposure to chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence on adult decision-making, coping response, cognitive bias, and exploratory behavior in rats. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (e.g., isolation, crowding, cage tilt) were compared to control animals that were maintained in standard, predictable conditions throughout development. Unpredictable stress during adolescence resulted in a suite of long-term behavioral and cognitive changes including a negative cognitive bias [F-(1,F- 12) = 5.000, P < 0.05], altered coping response [T-(1,T- 14) = 2.216, P = 0.04], and accelerated decision-making [T-(1,T- 14) = 3.245, P = 0.01]. Exposure to chronic stress during adolescence also caused a short-term increase in boldness behaviors; in a novel object test 15 days after the last stressor, animals exposed to chronic unpredictable stress had decreased latencies to leave a familiar shelter and approach a novel object [T-(1,T- 14) = 2.240, P = 0.04; T-(1,T- 14) = 2.419, P = 0.03, respectively]. The results showed that stress during adolescence has long-term impacts on behavior and cognition that affect the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, behavioral response to adverse events, and how animals make decisions.

AB  - Wild robust capuchins (Sapajus spp.) are omnivorous neotropical primates that live in relatively large groups in extensive home and daily ranges with activity budgets dominated by traveling, foraging, and object manipulation, meaning that enclosed spaces can result in significant deprivation. Space restriction, manipulation by caretakers, and the chronic presence of visitors, can disrupt the animals' welfare, altering their normal activities and inducing stress behaviors. We aimed to study the behavioral repertoire, activity budget, and frequency of stress behaviors (stereotypes and self-directed behaviors) between two captive groups of robust capuchins in a public zoo in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil, to understand how much their behavioral homeostasis has been affected. More specifically, we assessed the effect of environmental variables (temperature, relative air humidity, number of visitors, and food management) and sex on the frequency of stress behaviors. Capuchins showed a high frequency of stress behaviors, which represented around 10% of their activity budget (though the frequencies were unevenly distributed among the individuals), and traveling was positively correlated with stereotypes. We found that high relative air humidity appears to induce more stereotypes, high numbers of visitors appear to increase self-directed and vigilance behaviors and reduce stereotypes, food management can increase both kinds of stress behaviors, and females demonstrated more frequent stress behaviors than males, but individual variation may play a role. Capuchins in the group with a greater space restriction showed more stereotypes, while those in the group with more individuals showed more self-directed behaviors. Our study shows that the stress behaviors performed by the capuchins are complex and it is difficult to determine a single cause, because many traits could be involved. Despite that, this study enlightens us to direct some approaches to help these animals to meet their ecological and social needs, mitigating their stress.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, multisystem, progressive, degenerative disorder characterized by severe, debilitating motor dysfunction, cognitive impairments, and mood disorders. Although preclinical research has traditionally focused on the motor deficits resulting from the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, up to two thirds of PD patients present separate and distinct behavioral changes. Loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons occurs as early as the loss of dopaminergic cells and contributes to the cognitive decline in PD. In addition, attentional deficits can limit posture control and movement efficacy caused by dopaminergic cell loss. Complicating the picture further is intracellular alpha-synuclein accumulation beginning in the enteric nervous system and diffusing to the substantia nigra through the dorsal motor neurons of the vagus nerve. It seems that alpha-synuclein's role is that of mediating dopamine synthesis, storage, and release, and its function has not been completely understood. Treating a complex, multistage network disorder, such as PD, likely requires a multipronged approach. Here, we describe a few approaches that could be used alone or perhaps in combination to achieve a greater mosaic of behavioral benefit. These include (1) using encapsulated, genetically modified cells as delivery vehicles for administering neuroprotective trophic factors, such as GDNF, in a direct and sustained means to the brain; (2) immunotherapeutic interventions, such as vaccination or the use of monoclonal antibodies against aggregated, pathological alpha-synuclein; (3) the continuous infusion of levodopa-carbidopa through an intestinal gel pad to attenuate the loss of dopaminergic function and manage the motor and non-motor complications in PD patients; and (4) specific rehabilitation treatment programs for drug-refractory motor complications.

AB  - Antidepressants represent the standard treatment for major depression. However, their efficacy is variable and incomplete. A growing number of studies suggest that the environment plays a major role in determining the efficacy of these drugs, specifically of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). A recent hypothesis posits that the increase in serotonin levels induced by SSRI may not affect mood per se, but enhances neural plasticity and, consequently, renders the individual more susceptible to the influence of the environment. Thus, SSRI administration in a favorable environment would lead to a reduction of symptoms, while in a stressful environment might lead to a worse prognosis. To test this hypothesis, we treated C57BL/6 adult male mice with chronic fluoxetine while exposing them to either (i) an enriched environment, after exposure to a chronic stress period aimed at inducing a depression-like phenotype, or (ii) a stressful environment. Anhedonia, brain BDNF and circulating corticosterone levels, considered endophenotypes of depression, were investigated. Mice treated with fluoxetine in an enriched condition improved their depression-like phenotype compared to controls, displaying higher saccharin preference, higher brain BDNF levels and reduced corticosterone levels. By contrast, when chronic fluoxetine administration occurred in a stressful condition, mice showed a more distinct worsening of the depression-like profile, displaying a faster decrease of saccharin preference, lower brain BDNF levels and increased corticosterone levels. Our findings suggest that the effect of SSRI on depression-like phenotypes in mice is not determined by the drug per se but is induced by the drug and driven by the environment. These findings may be helpful to explain variable effects of SSRI found in clinical practice and to device strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.

AB  - Spaying of female dogs is a widespread practice, performed primarily for population control. While the consequences of early spaying for health are still being debated, the consequences for behaviour are believed to be negligible. The current study focused on the reported behaviour of 8981 female dogs spayed before 520 weeks (ten years) of life for reasons other than behavioural management, and calculated their percentage lifetime exposure to gonadal hormones (PLGH) as a proportion of their age at the time of being reported to the online Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). We found that 23 behaviours differed between entire and spayed dogs, of which 12 were associated with PLGH and 5 with age-at-spay (AAS). Two behaviours, chewing and howling, were significantly more likely in dogs with longer PLGH. In contrast, longer PLGH was associated with significantly reduced reporting of 10 (mostly unwelcome) behaviours. Of these, one related to fearfulness and three to aggression. The current data suggest that dogs' tendency to show numerous behaviours can be influenced by the timing of spaying. They indicate how female dog behaviour matures when gonadal hormones are allowed to have their effect. The differences reported here between undesirable behaviours of spayed and entire dogs were in the range of 5.33% and 7.22%, suggesting that, for some dogs, partial or complete denial of maturation may reduce howling and chewing and improve retrieval and recall, but have other undesirable consequences. Veterinarians may take these data into account to discuss the risks and benefits of spaying with clients, and the timing of the procedure.

AB  - Developmental alcohol exposure causes a host of cognitive and neuroanatomical abnormalities, one of which is impaired executive functioning resulting from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) damage. This study determined whether third-trimester equivalent alcohol exposure reduced the number of mPFC GABAergic parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, hypothesized to play an important role in local inhibition of the mPFC. The impact on passive avoidance learning and the therapeutic role of aerobic exercise in adulthood was also explored. Male C57BL/6J mice received either saline or 5 g/kg ethanol (two doses, two hours apart) on PD 5, 7, and 9. On PD 35, animals received a running wheel or remained sedentary for 48 days before behavioral testing and perfusion on PD 83. The number of PV + interneurons was stereologically measured in three separate mPFC subregions: infralimbic, prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). Neonatal alcohol exposure decreased number of PV+ interneurons and volume of the ACC, but the other regions of the mPFC were spared. Alcohol impaired acquisition, but not retrieval of passive avoidance, and had no effect on motor performance on the rotarod. Exercise had no impact on PV+ cell number, mPFC volume, or acquisition of passive avoidance, but enhanced retrieval in both control and alcohol-exposed groups, and enhanced rotarod performance in the control mice. Results support the hypothesis that part of the behavioral deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure are due to reduced PV+ interneurons in the ACC, but unfortunately exercise does not appear to be able to reverse any of these deficits.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The study of animal personality is important to conserve animals because it can help in selecting the most appropriate individuals to be released into the wild. Individuals not so bold or aggressive, less stressed, who explore their new environment with greater caution are often more likely to survive after release into the wild. In contrast, bolder and more aggressive animals reproduce more successfully and, therefore, can be released with the aim of rapid repopulation of an area. These and other aspects of how animal personality can help in conservation programs, as well as how to collect personality data are covered in this paper.
   The number of animal species threatened with extinction are increasing every year, and biologists are conducting animal translocations, as one strategy, to try to mitigate this situation. Furthermore, researchers are evaluating methods to increase translocation success, and one area that shows promise is the study of animal personality. Animal personality can be defined as behavioral and physiological differences between individuals of the same species, which are stable in time and across different contexts. In the present paper, we discuss how animal personality can increase the success of translocation, as well as in the management of animals intended for translocation by evaluating personality characteristics of the individuals. Studies of the influence of birthplace, parental behavior, stress resilience, and risk assessment can be important to select the most appropriate individuals to be released. Finally, we explain the two methods used to gather personality data.

AB  - The wide heterogeneity and complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' clinical profiles and increased mortality highlight the relevance of personalized-based interventions and the need for end-of-life/survival predictors. At the translational level, studying genetic and age interactions in a context of different levels of expression of AD-genetic-load can help to understand this heterogeneity better. In the present report, a singular cohort of long-lived (19-month-old survivors) heterozygous and homozygous male 3xTg-AD mice were studied to determine whether their AD-genotype load can modulate the brain and peripheral pathological burden, behavioral phenotypes, and neuro-immunoendocrine status, compared to age-matched non-transgenic controls. The results indicated increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in a genetic-load-dependent manner but convergent synaptophysin and choline acetyltransferase brain levels. Cognitive impairment and HPA-axis hyperactivation were salient traits in both 3xTg-AD survivor groups. In contrast, genetic load elicited different anxiety-like profiles, with hypoactive homozygous, while heterozygous resembled controls in some traits and risk assessment. Complex neuro-immunoendocrine crosstalk was also observed. Bodyweight loss and splenic, renal, and hepatic histopathological injury scores provided evidence of the systemic features of AD, despite similar peripheral organs' oxidative stress. The present study provides an interesting translational scenario to study further genetic-load and age-dependent vulnerability/compensatory mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Separation anxiety is a common behavior disorder, but our understanding of its etiology and underlying neurochemical mechanisms remains limited. The purpose of this study was to compare serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in dogs with and without separation anxiety. BDNF, one of several neurotrophins, is prevalent in the limbic region and prefrontal cortex, which are key areas related to the regulation of mood, emotion, and cognition. Although an enriched environment increases BDNF levels, stress and glucocorticoid exposure decrease the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. As separation anxiety is associated with chronic stress, we hypothesized that BDNF levels in dogs affected by separation anxiety would be lower than BDNF levels in nonaffected dogs. A total of forty-eight dogs were classified by a board-certified behaviorist as affected (n = 15) or nonaffected (n = 33) by separation anxiety based on review of video clips of the dogs when left alone and owner reports of the dogs' behavior. Groups did not differ in regard to age, body weight, body condition score, or sex, and most dogs were mixed breed. Fasted serum samples were analyzed with a canine BDNF ELISA. Nine (60%) dogs in the affected group and 12 (36%) dogs in the nonaffected group had a BDNF level <0.156 ng/ml, the minimally detectable level of the ELISA. The median (range) serum BDNF level was 0.10 (0.02-1.05) ng/ml for the affected group and 0.40 (0.03-9.98) ng/ml for the nonaffected group, after replacing the undetectable values with a random value between 0 and 0.156. The difference in BDNF level between the groups was significant (P = 0.037). The finding suggests the potential of serum BDNF as a biomarker for anxiety-related disorders in dogs.

AB  - A 10-y-old cranially implanted rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) involved in visual research was presented for dull mentation and weight loss. Physical examination revealed alopecia and poor body conditioning, and bloodwork revealed marked hypercortisolemia (23 mu g/dL). Differential diagnoses for hypercortisolemia, weight loss, and alopecia included Cushing and pseudo-Cushing syndromes. To further evaluate hypercortisolemia, we compared the urine cortisol: creatinine ratio (UCCR) at baseline and after low-dose dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) testing in the presenting animal and healthy naive and implanted working monkeys. At baseline, UCCR was 10 times higher in the presenting macaque (118.1 +/- 7.1) than in naive animals (12.5 +/- 12.8) and 3 times higher than in healthy implanted working macaques (44.4 +/- 6.9); however, levels were suppressed similarly by dexamethasone in both the presenting animal and healthy controls. In addition, healthy implanted working macaques had significantly higher baseline UCCR levels than naive controls, suggesting chronic stress in working animals. Abdominal ultrasonography and radiographs of the presenting animal revealed marked bilateral adrenal mineralization but no overt adrenal tumor or hyperplasia. Overall, these results excluded endogenous Cushing syndrome and prompted us to evaluate different causes of pseudo-Cushing syndrome, including depression. Using videorecordings to evaluate behavior, we used published criteria for macaque models of depression models, including huddling, to make a presumptive diagnosis of depression. The macaque was treated with fluoxetine (2 mg/kg PO daily), provided increased environmental enrichment, and followed over time by regular UCCR assessment and videorecordings. The animal improved clinically and behaviorally, and UCCR returned to levels observed in working implanted macaques (44.4) after 8 wk of treatment. This case highlights the potential effect of research-related work on stress and pathologic behaviors in macaques and demonstrates the utility of UCCR and LDDS for screening behavioral and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal abnormalities in these animals.

AB  - Cognitive processes are influenced by underlying affective states, and tests of cognitive bias have recently been developed to assess the valence of affective states in animals. These tests are based on the fact that individuals in a negative affective state interpret ambiguous stimuli more pessimistically than individuals in a more positive state. Using two strains of mice we explored whether unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) can induce a negative judgement bias and whether variation in the expression of stereotypic behaviour is associated with variation in judgement bias. Sixteen female CD-1 and 16 female C57BL/6 mice were trained on a tactile conditional discrimination test with grade of sandpaper as a cue for differential food rewards. Once they had learned the discrimination, half of the mice were subjected to UCMS for three weeks to induce a negative affective state. Although UCMS induced a reduced preference for the higher value reward in the judgement bias test, it did not affect saccharine preference or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. However, UCMS affected responses to ambiguous (intermediate) cues in the judgement bias test. While control mice showed a graded response to ambiguous cues, UCMS mice of both strains did not discriminate between ambiguous cues and tended to show shorter latencies to the ambiguous cues and the negative reference cue. UCMS also increased bar-mouthing in CD-1, but not in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, mice with higher levels of stereotypic behaviour made more optimistic choices in the judgement bias test. However, no such relationship was found for stereotypic bar-mouthing, highlighting the importance of investigating different types of stereotypic behaviour separately. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that behavioral traits are subject to transgenerational modification by paternal environmental factors. We previously reported on the transgenerational influences of increased paternal stress hormone levels on offspring anxiety and depression-related behaviors. Here, we investigated whether offspring sociability and cognition are also influenced by paternal stress. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were treated with corticosterone (CORT; 25 mg/L) for four weeks prior to paired-matings to generate F1 offspring. Paternal CORT treatment was associated with decreased body weights of female offspring and a marked reduction of the male offspring. There were no differences in social behavior of adult F1 offspring in the three-chamber social interaction test. Despite male offspring of CORT-treated fathers displaying hyperactivity in the Y-maze, there was no observable difference in short-term spatial working memory. Spatial learning and memory testing in the Morris water maze revealed that female, but not male, F1 offspring of CORT-treated fathers had impaired memory retention. We used our recently developed methodology to analyze the spatial search strategy of the mice during the learning trials and determined that the impairment could not be attributed to underlying differences in search strategy. These results provide evidence for the impact of paternal corticosterone administration on offspring cognition and complement the cumulative knowledge of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of acquired traits in rodents and humans.

AB  - The aging process can be influenced by environmental factors, such as the social environment. The continuous cohabitation of the chronologically old mice with adult animals improves them at the behavioral level, immune function, oxidative stress and longevity, but causes a deterioration of these parameters in adults. Therefore, the objective of the study was to study whether the coexistence for only 15 min a day of old mice with adult mice, can produce that improvement and greater longevity in old animals without causing deterioration in adults. For that, old and adult CD1 female mice, after two months of that social interaction, were submitted to a behavioral battery and then peritoneal leukocytes were collected to assess several immune functions, oxidative and inflammatory stress parameters as well as catecholamine concentrations. When the adult mice reached old age, the same parameters were again analyzed. The life span of each animal was also recorded. Plasmatic concentration of oxytocin was also studied. The results showed that old mice presented better behavioral capacity, immunity and oxi-inflammatory state after this social interaction with adult animals, and consequently an extended life span. Adult mice, in general, did not show any changes after social interaction with old animals, but when they achieved old age, improvements of some parameters and of longevity were observed in comparison with animals that never had a that social interaction. In conclusion, a short social interaction between old and adult individuals can be an excellent strategy for improving in both the health state and longevity.

AB  - The consistency of personality assessment was addressed in this study of 12 zoological African elephants living at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, CA, USA during the 2010 and 2011 summer seasons. Using 480 h of observational behavior data, three personality traits were determined based on behavior events, with the most significant correlations (two-tailed r(s) > 0.77, P < 0.005) being playful, curious, and sociable. During both summers, the animal care staff rated all elephants across 25 adjective items. Four rating-based personality traits were then clustered based on items with the most significant correlations (one-tailed r(s)>0.72, P<0.005): playful, observant, shy and confident. All seven personality traits correlated significantly (P<0.05) from 2010 to 2011 for each individual elephant, demonstrating temporal stability. Additionally, the coded playful trait was correlated significantly (P<0.01) to the rated trait playful, demonstrating construct validity and cross-method consistency. These results suggest that humans have the ability to discriminate zoo elephant personalities reliably and accurately. This, therefore, suggests that rating of zoo elephant personalities by caretakers with extensive knowledge of the species' behavioral repertoire may be a valid proxy for long-term behavioral monitoring. Personality assessments may allow animal caretakers to identify appropriate roles for certain individuals (i.e., social compatibility, operant training, and transport to another facility), aid the individualization of environmental enrichment, and provide vital predictors of coping ability (i.e., stress response/resiliency).

AB  - The benefits of long-term moderate exercise for health are widely accepted in humans, but few animal studies have been undertaken to characterize the effects of such activity on emotionality and responsiveness to stress. The present study describes the effects of long-term moderate forced treadmill training (36 weeks) on exploratory activity, anxiety-like behaviour, and the resting or stress levels of some physiological variables, including pituitary-adrenal (PA) hormones. Five-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on the treadmill (TM) for 36 weeks, using a more moderate training (12 m/min, 30 min/day, 4-5 days/week) than that currently used in the literature. Two groups were used as controls: a non-handled sedentary (SED) group, receiving no manipulation, and a control (CON) group exposed to a stationary treadmill for the same amount of time as the TM group. In accordance with literature data, TM rats showed lower resting levels of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol than the other two groups. The TM and CON groups both showed higher ambulation than the SED group in some behavioural tests, without evidence for altered anxiety. Resting levels of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone did not differ among the groups, but a reduced ACTH response to both a novel environment (mild stressor) and an active escape-avoidance task (severe stressor) was observed in TM rats, whereas changes in corticosterone were modest. The results support the view that the physiological consequences of long-term moderate training are beneficial, including reduced PA responsiveness to stress, even though exercise training did not affect anxiety-like behaviour.

AB  - Stressful experiences can affect hippocampal structure and function and can suppress new cell birth in the adult hippocampus in several species. Here we examine how repeated intermittent social defeat affects cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) in mice. Adult male CFW mice were subjected to 10 daily social defeat episodes, 3 defeat episodes within one day or a single defeat episode. Intruder mice were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 200 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h after the last fight, and incorporation of BrdU into proliferating cells in the DG was quantified. In a third experiment, aggressive resident mice were allowed to fight with an intruder mouse every day for 10 days, and these residents were injected with BrdU 1 h after the last aggressive encounter. There was a significant decrease in cell proliferation in mice that received 10 social defeats, confirming and extending earlier results. This decrease is correlated with the intensity of the defeat experiences, as quantified by frequency of attack bites. Cell proliferation was slightly inhibited after a single defeat, although this effect was not significant. Three defeats within a 5-h period had no effect on levels of proliferation. Offensive aggressive stress in the residents did not result in any changes in hippocampal cell proliferation. These data indicate that repeated intermittent social defeat experienced over multiple days suppresses proliferation in the DG, and this may have important implications for our understanding of hippocampal changes related to stress psychopathologies.

AB  - When a maternal rat nurtures her pups, she relies on adequate resources to provide optimal care for her offspring. Accordingly, limited environmental resources may result in atypical maternal care, disrupting various developmental outcomes. In the current study, maternal Long-Evans rats were randomly assigned to either a standard resource (SR) group, provided with four cups of bedding and two paper towels for nesting material or a limited resource (LR) group, provided with a quarter of the bedding and nesting material provided for the SR group. Offspring were monitored at various developmental phases throughout the study. After weaning, pups were housed in same-sex dyads in environments with SRs for continued observations. Subsequent behavioral tests revealed a sex x resource interaction in play behavior on PND 28; specifically, LR reduced play attacks in males while LR increased play attacks in females. A sex x resource interaction was also observed in anxiety-related responses in the open field task with an increase in thigmotaxis in LR females and, in the social interaction task, females exhibited more external rears oriented away from the social target. Focusing on morphological variables, tail length measurements of LR males and females were shorter on PND 9, 16, and 21; however, differences in tail length were no longer present at PND 35. Following the behavioral assessments, animals were perfused at 56 days of age and subsequent immunohistochemical assays indicated increased glucocorticoid receptors in the lateral habenula of LR offspring and higher c-Fos immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdala of SR offspring. Further, when tail vertebrae and tail tendons were assessed via micro-CT and hydroxyproline assays, results indicated increased trabecular separation, decreased bone volume fraction, and decreased connectivity density in bones, along with reduced collagen concentration in tendons in the LR animals. In sum, although the restricted resources only persisted for a brief duration, the effects appear to be far-reaching and pervasive in this early life stress animal model.

AB  - Adult neural stem/progenitor cells proliferate throughout the life of the animal in the subependymal zone and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyros (DG). Treatments such as enriched environment, dietary restriction, running and anti-depressants increase proliferation, however, stress and opiates have been shown to decrease proliferation. While models of binge ethanol drinking decreases proliferation, few studies have characterized the effect chronic ethanol usage has on progenitor cell proliferation. In this study, we have examined changes in the progenitor cell proliferation rate following chronic ethanol consumption. Animals were given a nutritionally balanced liquid diet containing 6.5% v/v ethanol or an isocalorically balanced liquid diet. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered (150 mg/kg x 3) and the animals sacrificed 2 h after the last injection on days 3, 10 or 30 of the ethanol diet. Coronal brain blocks were paraffin embedded and 6 mum sections sliced and immunohistochemically stained for BrdU. Quantitation of the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the subgranular zone of the DG revealed a significant decrease only at the 3-day time-point, with recovery by the 10- and 30-day time-points. Thus, the progenitor cell proliferation rate is transiently decreased by chronic ethanol usage. This data suggests that chronic alcohol use results in a compensatory response that restores the progenitor cell proliferation rate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Performance of abnormal repetitive behavior (ARB) is noted in many captive wild species. ARB can be categorized into 2 basic forms: those whose aim appears to be to compulsively reach an inappropriate goal and those whose performance is linked to an inappropriate motor function. Although the negative welfare connotations of ARBs are well known, the precise reason for their performance remains the subject of debate. As zoos move forward in collection planning and to gather more evidence on the biological needs of the species being kept, the idea that ARBs may be part of a coping function adds more weight to arguments that some species may not be suitable for the zoo at all. Modern-day definitions of animal welfare tell us to measure the well-being of the individual based on its attempts at coping with its immediate environment. A failure to cope, and hence performance of ARB, is an objective and measurable welfare metric that may highlight which species are appropriate for captivity. As conservation pressures on zoos mount, and the need to take in more captive-naive species increases, research on why captive wild animals develop ARB can be used to inform practice. In this article, we aim to review the welfare issues across 3 basic categories of zoo animal (mammals, birds, and ectothermic vertebrates) and critique how research into ARBs can be used by zoos to promote wild-type behavior patterns by providing biologically relevant management and husbandry regimes, which allow animals the key components of control and choice over what they do and how they do it.

AB  - Investigating depression-like conditions in animals is methodologically challenging, but potentially important for welfare. Some riding horses display 'withdrawn' states of inactivity and low responsiveness that resemble the reduced engagement with the environment shown by certain depressed patients. To assess whether these animals are experiencing a depression-like state, we investigated anhedonia - the loss of pleasure, a key symptom of human depression - in 20 withdrawn and non-withdrawn horses from the same stable. The time horses spent being withdrawn appeared unrelated to age or sex, but correlated with time devoted to stereotypic behaviour, a possible marker of lifetime stress. Comparison with data collected 5 years earlier also revealed that horses scored as withdrawn then remained significantly likely to display the behaviour. We measured sucrose intake, a classic measure of anhedonia never previously applied to horses. Flavoured sugar blocks, novel to these subjects, were mounted in each stall and weighed 3, 8, 24 and 30 h after provision. We predicted that if affected by depression-like states, the most withdrawn horses would consume the least sucrose. This prediction was met (F-1,F-18 = 4.65, two tailed p = 0.04). This pattern could, however, potentially reflect general appetite levels and/or food neophobia. To control for these confounds, hay consumption was measured over 5 days, as were subjects' latencies to eat a meal scented with a novel odour. Although low hay consumption and long latencies to eat scented food did predict low sucrose consumption, statistically controlling for these confounds did not eliminate the relationship between being withdrawn and consuming less sucrose (although reducing it to a strong trend): F-1,F-15 = 4.28, two-tailed p = 0.056. These data thus suggest long-lasting depression-like states in certain riding horses, which correlate with stereotypic behaviour and are characterised by anhedonia and bouts of 'withdrawn' unresponsiveness.

AB  - The minimalistic environment of standard laboratory cages can adversely influence the responses of animals in standard behavioural tests and other aspects of the animals' biology. To avoid this, cages should provide for the animals' species-specific behavioural characteristics. We hypothesized that, given their possible capacity for colour vision, laboratory mice, Mus musculus, would show preferences between cages of different colours. Studies show that environmental colour can influence emotionality and task performance in humans, suggesting that cage colour could also affect emotionality and performance of mice in behavioural tests. Seventy-two mice were housed in home cages painted red, black, green or white. Five weeks later, 24 mice were placed individually into an apparatus allowing them to choose between cages of each of the home cage colours. Each mouse showed a highly significant preference, which overall, was unrelated to home cage colour. White cages were most preferred and red were least. Home cage colour had a significant effect on body weight and food consumption as well as on behaviour in a raised plus maze. Mice from red home cages spent most time in the closed arms, indicating greater anxiety, possibly suggesting that the reduced occupancy of the red preference cages resulted from avoidance of environmental conditions that induced a negative mental state. These findings show that laboratory mice have strong preferences between cages of different colours. We also found that an apparently inconsequential environmental variable, home cage colour, can influence responses in standard behavioural tests, which should be considered in assessing the external validity of such tests.

AB  - Maternal separation (MS) is a model to induce permanent alternations in the central nervous system (CNS) and is associated with increased levels of anxiety and cognitive deficiencies. Since methyl donor choline (Ch) has been shown to play a significant role in learning and memory and enhance synaptic plasticity, the authors hypothesized that Ch may attenuate MS-induced impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. Rat pups underwent an MS protocol for 180 min/day from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 21. Ch was administered subcutaneously (100 mg/kg, 21 days) to the choline chloride and MS + choline chloride groups from PND 29 to 49. Anxiety-like behaviour, recognition memory, and spatial and passive avoidance learning and memory were measured in the adolescent rats. In addition, evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) were recorded from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. MS induced higher anxiety-like behaviour in the animals. It also impaired learning and memory. However, MS had no effect on locomotor activity. Subcutaneous administration of Ch attenuated MS-induced cognitive deficits and enhanced the learning and memory of MS rats. Ch also decreased anxiety-like behaviour in the open-field test. The present results showed that long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in all groups except MS and MS + saline animals. However, Ch injection induced LTP and had maintenance in MS + choline chloride, but it was not statistically significant compared with the MS group. In summary, the present findings indicate that MS can interfere with normal animal's cognition and subcutaneous of Ch may be considered an appropriate therapeutic strategy for promoting cognitive dysfunctions in MS animals.

AB  - TMEM132D is a candidate gene, where risk genotypes have been associated with anxiety severity along with higher mRNA expression in the frontal cortex of panic disorder patients. Concurrently, in a high (HAB) and low (LAB) trait anxiety mouse model, Tmem132d was found to show increased expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) of HAB as compared to LAB mice. To understand the molecular underpinnings underlying the differential expression, we sequenced the gene and found two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter differing between both lines which could explain the observed mRNA expression profiles using gene reporter assays. In addition, there was no difference in basal DNA methylation in the CpG Island that encompasses the HAB vs. LAB Tmem132d promoter region. Furthermore, we found significantly higher binding of RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) to the proximal HAB-specific SNP (rs233264624) than the corresponding LAB locus in an oligonucleotide pull-down assay, suggesting increased transcription. Virus mediated overexpression of Tmem132d in the aCC of C57BL/6 J mice could confirm its role in mediating an anxiogenic phenotype. To model gene-environmental interactions, HAB mice exposed to enriched environment (HAB-EE) responded with decreased anxiety levels but, had enhanced Tmem132d mRNA expression as compared to standard-housed HAB (HAB-SH) mice. While LAB mice subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (LAB-UCMS) exhibited higher anxiety levels and had lower mRNA expression compared to standard-housed LAB (LAB-SH) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed significantly higher binding of POLR2A to rs233264624 in HAB-EE, while LAB-UCMS had lower POLR2A binding at this locus, thus explaining the enhanced or attenuated expression of Tmem132d compared to their respective SH controls. To further investigate gene-environment interactions, DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina 450 K BeadChip in 74 panic disorder patients. Significant methylation differences were observed in two CpGs (cg26322591 and cg03283235) located in TMEM132D depending on the number of positive life events supporting the results of an influence of positive environmental cues on regulation of Tmem132d expression in mice.

AB  - Outbred rats are widely used in biomedical research studies. The genotypic variation, different housing and handling conditions during development, and gender of used rats can be expected to cause variations in behavior and epileptogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that adult female Wistar rats from different breeders vary in anxiety-like behavior, seizure susceptibility, and epileptogenesis in the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy.
   In female Wistar rats from three different commercial breeders ([HsdCpb:WU], [Crl:WI(Han)], and [RjHan:WI]), anxiety-like behavior was monitored in the open field and the elevated plus maze. Wistar rats from Charles River showed lower locomotor activity and higher anxiety-like behavior compared to Wistar rats from Harlan-Winkelmann and Janvier. Female Wistar rats from Harlan-Winkelmann showed the lowest anxiety-like behavior and the highest exploratory behavior.
   Subsequently, rats were kindled by daily electrical stimulation of the right amygdala as a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Wistar rats from Charles River exhibited significantly increased cumulative motor seizure duration and cumulative afterdischarge duration until seizure generalization compared to Harlan-Winkelmann and Janvier rats. In other words, Wistar rats from Charles River showed a longer time of focal seizures until generalization, reflecting a slower epileptogenesis in these rats. The initial afterdischarge threshold did not differ significantly between Wistar rats from the three breeders, indicating that baseline seizure susceptibility is not different between the three groups. In conclusion, female Wistar outbred rats from different breeders showed variations in anxiety-like behavior and epileptogenesis. Decisions about appropriate commercial colonies used for biomedical research should be taken with caution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is known that stress can influence the sensitivity to rewarding stimuli. Previous observations revealed that socially stressed rats do not display an appetitive behavioural response in anticipation of a reward. A previous study showed that this insensitivity to rewards (anhedonia) could be restored by chronic administration of an antidepressant. Several lines of evidence exist for the role of dopamine in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments concerning their therapeutic effect on anhedonia. Therefore, it was hypothesized that regular activation of the reward system, that involves mesolimbic dopaminergic systems, could counteract the effect of social stress on reward-sensitivity. For this, it was investigated whether a treatment of regular reward announcements could prevent the development of anhedonia. This was confirmed by the result that socially stressed rats that received this treatment were able to display anticipatory behaviour which is characterized by increased activity after presentation of a stimulus that was previously associated with a sucrose reward. Surprisingly, a non-treated socially stressed group, that did not show an anticipatory response for sucrose, did display anticipatory behaviour for another type of reward (enriched cage). It seems that, although one might assume the existence of an anhedonic state based upon the absence of anticipatory activity towards a sucrose reward, this assumption cannot be generalised to other types of reward. It will be discussed whether this might be caused by the highly rewarding properties of the enriched cage which probably has a therapeutical efficacy of its own.

AB  - Postnatal manipulations such as brief (early handling, EH) and long, daily mother-offspring separations (maternal separation, MS) in rats are used to study the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity of stress and fear responses, and to model stress-related disorders in humans and in non-human animals. Current evidence suggests that, compared to non-handled rats, EH reduces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) reactivity in the adult offspring through stimulating increased levels of active maternal care. In contrast, despite a similar increase in active maternal care, MS does not reduce HPA reactivity, thus suggesting that long mother-offspring separations may counteract the effects of increased active maternal care. We therefore attempted to selectively manipulate levels of active maternal care and durations of mother-offspring separations in neonate rats. Rat pups were exposed to different combinations of EH and MS from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 10 using a split-litter design. Maternal behaviour was recorded from PND 2 to 8 and behavioural and endocrine responses to stress were studied in adult male offspring. Low levels of maternal care combined with long mother-offspring separations increased HPA-reactivity compared to both high maternal care combined with long mother-offspring separations and low maternal care combined with brief separations. These findings further support the hypothesis that active maternal care and long mother-offspring separation act independently, and exert opposing effects, on adult offspring's HPA responses, but that increased maternal care may buffer the adverse consequences of long separations.

AB  - Physical touch can help to decrease the effects of stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of tactile stimulation on the hormonal and behavioral responses of young adult rats submitted to chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMS), considering the role of angiotensin II (Ang II). In Experiment 1, male rats were divided into 4 groups: control, stress, tactile stimulation (TS), and stress+ TS. CMS was applied for three weeks. Tactile stimulation was applied for seven weeks, five days a week. After the CMS protocol, depression-like behaviors were evaluated by forced swimming and sucrose consumption tests. Learning and memory were evaluated using the Y-maze test. Fifteen days after the CMS procedure, the animals were euthanized and the levels of stress hormones were determined. The hypothalamus was isolated for determination of the Ang II concentration. In Experiment 2, control and stressed rats, with or without treatment using losartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker), were evaluated using the same behavioral tests and the hypothalamus Ang II concentration was also determined. CMS increased plasma corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine concentrations, induced depression-like behaviors, impaired learning and memory, and increased the Ang II concentration in the hypothalamus. Tactile stimulation attenuated these stress-induced effects. Losartan treatment effectively prevented increase of the hypothalamic Ang II concentration and the development of depression-like behavior, and also reduced the impairment of learning and memory in the stressed animals. The results indicated that tactile stimulation seemed to protect adult rats against hormonal and behavioral chronic stress effects, and that Ang II could be involved in the CMS effects.

AB  - The domestic rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, is descended from the European rabbit, which fives in large social groups and digs extensive warrens. Behavior problems include urine spraying, failure to, use the litter box, fear of humans and human-directed aggression, intraspecies aggression, destructive, digging and chewing, and infanticide. These problems are best prevented and treated by understanding their origin in both species-specific behavior and learning. Urine spraying is primarily, a problem of intact males. Litter box use results from both rabbits; species-specific tendency to use particular sites for elimination and from training. Rabbits may become. fearful of humans because of painful or frightening experiences with them. Rabbits will become comfortable with humans if they have numerous positive interactions with them.. Fearful or aggressive, rabbits may be treated by repeatedly exposing them to pleasant associations with humans. Rabbits are territorial and may aggressively reject new rabbits that are not members of the group. Introduction of a new rabbit must be gradual, allowing rabbits to become familiar with each other and preventing them from fighting. Digging and chewing are natural, species-specific behaviors. Giving rabbits acceptable objects to chew prevents them from destroying, household items. Infanticide, originates, in part, from intense competition between wild females for safe nesting sites. Housing birthing does separately may prevent infanticide. Copyright 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neonatal handling, an experimental model of early life experiences, is known to affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function thus increasing adaptability, coping with stress, cognitive abilities and in general brain plasticity-related processes. A molecule that plays a most critical role in such processes is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a tetramer consisting of two obligatory, channel forming NR1 subunits and two regulatory subunits, usually a combination of NR2A and NR2B. Since the subunit composition of the NMDA receptor affects brain plasticity, in the present study we investigated the effect of neonatal handling on NR1, NR2A and NR2B mRNA levels using in situ hybridization, and on NR2B binding sites, using autoradiography of in vitro binding of [H-3]-ifenprodil, in adult rat limbic brain areas. We found that neonatal handling specifically increased NR2B mRNA and binding sites, while it had no effect on the NR1 and NR2A subunits. More specifically, neonatally handled animals, both males and females, had higher NR2B mRNA and binding sites in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal area, as well as the prelimbic, the anterior cingulate and the somatosensory cortex, compared to the non-handled. Moreover NR2B binding sites were increased in the dorsal CA3 area of handled animals of both sexes. Furthermore, neonatal handling had a sexually dimorphic effect, increasing NR2B mRNA and binding sites in the central and medial amygdaloid nuclei only of the females. The neonatal handling-induced increase in the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor could underlie the higher brain plasticity, which neonatally handled animals exhibit. (C) 2009 IBRO.

AB  - Whether social isolation of adult rats under standard laboratory conditions produces significant long-term alterations in behavior and physiology is unclear. In the present study, male Sprague Dawley rats were singly or paired-housed for 10 wk. During this period, they were tested for acquisition, extinction, and reacquisition of heroin (0.3 mg/kg)-conditioned place preference. Fecal corticoid metabolite levels were analyzed several times throughout the period of housing, and food consumption and body weight were monitored. During place conditioning, heroin induced a significant increase in locomotor activity in both singly and pair housed rats, and the resulting place preference was similar in both groups. However, singly housed rats showed increased motor reactivity to heroin on reconditioning after extinction and displayed significant reacquisition of conditioned place preference, compared with pair-housed animals. Over the 10-wk period of the study, there were no differences in body weight or food consumption between groups. Mild significant increases in relative adrenal gland weight and decreases in relative brain weight were noted in singly housed animals compared with those paired. Significant decreases in nocturnal fecal corticoid metabolite output were noted in both groups, with loss of circadian variation in fecal corticoid levels over the course of the study. These data suggest that male Sprague Dawley rats, irrespective of single or pair housing, develop reduced hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis activity over time under standard laboratory housing conditions. Single housing can enhance both this effect and sensitivity to the stimulatory and rewarding actions of heroin after withdrawal.

AB  - Critical periods are postnatal, restricted time windows of heightened plasticity in cortical neural networks, during which experience refines principal neuron wiring configurations. Here, we propose a model with two distinct types of synapses,innate synapsesthat establish rudimentary networks with innate function, andgestalt synapsesthat govern the experience-dependent refinement process. Nascent gestalt synapses are constantly formed as AMPA receptor-silent synapses which are the substrates for critical period plasticity. Experience drives the unsilencing and stabilization of gestalt synapses, as well as synapse pruning. This maturation process changes synapse patterning and consequently the functional architecture of cortical excitatory networks. Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the primary visual cortex (V1) is an established experimental model for cortical plasticity. While converging evidence indicates that the start of the critical period for ODP is marked by the maturation of local inhibitory circuits, recent results support our model that critical periods end through the progressive maturation of gestalt synapses. The cooperative yet opposing function of two postsynaptic signaling scaffolds of excitatory synapses, PSD-93 and PSD-95, governs the maturation of gestalt synapses. Without those proteins, networks do not progress far beyond their innate functionality, resulting in rather impaired perception. While cortical networks remain malleable throughout life, the cellular mechanisms and the scope of critical period and adult plasticity differ. Critical period ODP is initiated with the depression of deprived eye responses in V1, whereas adult ODP is characterized by an initial increase in non-deprived eye responses. Our model proposes the gestalt synapse-based mechanism for critical period ODP, and also predicts a different mechanism for adult ODP based on the sparsity of nascent gestalt synapses at that age. Under our model, early life experience shapes the boundaries (the gestalt) for network function, both for its optimal performance as well as for its pathological state. Thus, reintroducing nascent gestalt synapses as plasticity substrates into adults may improve the network gestalt to facilitate functional recovery.

AB  - Early life adversity in humans is linked to cognitive deficits and increased risk of mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, with evidence for different vulnerabilities in men versus women. Modeling early life adversity in rodents shows similar neuropsychological deficits that may partially be driven by sex-dependent dysfunction in parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HPC), and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Research demonstrates that PV interneurons are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress; therefore, accumulation of oxidative damage may drive PV dysfunction following early life adversity. The goal of this study was to quantify oxidative stress accumulation in PV neurons in rats exposed to maternal separation (MS). Pups were separated from their dam and littermates for 4h per day from postnatal day (P)2 to 20. Serial sections from the PFC, HPC, and BLA of juvenile (P20) rats of both sexes were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against PV and 8-oxo-dG, a marker for oxidative DNA damage. PV cell counts, colocalization with 8-oxo-dG, and intensity of each signal were measured in each region to determine the effects of MS and establish whether MS-induced oxidative damage varies between sexes. A significant increase in colocalization of PV and 8-oxo-dG was found in the PFC and HPC, indicating increased oxidative stress in that cell population following MS. Region-specific sex differences were also revealed in the PFC, BLA, and HPC. These data identify oxidative stress during juvenility as a potential mechanism mediating PV dysfunction in individuals with a history of early life adversity.

AB  - Stress during developmental stage may cause psychological morbidities, and then the studies on stress are important in adolescent rodents. Restraint is used as a common stressor in rodents and the effects of restraint during the light cycle have been studied, but those of restraint during the dark cycle have not. The present study examined the effects of restraint during the light and dark cycles on anxiety behaviors in adolescent mice. Restraint for 3 h during either the light or dark cycle impaired memory function in the fear conditioning test, but did not affect locomotor activity. In the elevated plus-maze test, restraint during the dark cycle reduced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Repeated exposure to a 3-h period dark cycle restraint for 2 weeks had a similar anxiolytic-like effect. In contrast, restraint for 3 h during the light cycle produced anxiety behavior in adolescent, but not adult, mice. The light cycle stress increased plasma corticosterone levels, and elevated c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, basolateral amygdala and dentate gyrus, and enhanced serotonin turnover in the hippocampus and striatum, while the dark cycle stress did not. There was no difference in the stress-mediated reduction in pentobarbital-induced sleeping time between dark and light cycle restraint. These findings suggest that the anxiolytic effect of dark cycle restraint is mediated by corticosterone, serotonin or "y-aminobutyric acid-independent mechanisms, although the anxiogenic effect of light cycle restraint is associated with changes in plasma corticosterone levels and serotonin turnover in specific brain regions.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural circuit plasticity that results in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life(1,2). Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic plasticity during their maturation(3) and can account for up to ten per cent of the entire granule cell population(4). Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial effects on cognition and mood, such as learning(5), environmental enrichment(6), exercise(6) and chronic treatment with antidepressants(7-10). Together, these properties of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific cognitive functions(11), as well as some of the behavioural effects of antidepressants(8-10,12,13), it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal ageing(14,15).

AB  - Simple Summary Compassion is a warm response of care and concern for those who are suffering, which drives individuals to devote their resources for the sake of others. A prominent evolutionary framework grounds compassion in the neurobiology of the caregiving system - the inborn motivation to support close others in times of need. The current review paper investigates the neurobiological mechanisms of compassion, and in particular, the neuropeptide oxytocin which is known to play a significant role in caregiving. Integrating the state-of-the-art literature on oxytocin with the current understanding of compassion, we suggest that oxytocin regulates the necessary precursor of compassion, i.e., the saliency of pain and distress cues. In according to this view, social cues are more likely to be noticed and responded to in an oxytocin-enriched environment. This framework focuses on the saliency processes in the context of social suffering. It sheds light on two central aspects of compassion. First, it highlights the less investigated initial stages of compassion, i.e. sensitivity and attentiveness to pain and distress. Second, it opens the door to the vast variability of social responses when facing suffering others, by demonstrating that emotions, motivations and behaviors elicited by such sensitivity to pain are crucially dependent on context and personality. Compassion is a warm response of care and concern for those who are suffering, which drives individuals to devote their resources for the sake of others. A prominent neuroevolutionary framework grounds compassion in the neurobiology of the mammalian caregiving system. Accordingly, it has been suggested that the oxytocinergic system, which plays a central role in parental caregiving and bonding, provides the neurobiological foundation for compassion towards strangers. Yet, the specific role of oxytocin in compassion is far from clear. The current paper aims to target this gap and offer a theoretical framework that integrates the state-of-the-art literature on oxytocin with research on compassion. We suggest that oxytocin mediates compassion by enhancing the saliency of cues of pain and distress and discuss the plausible underlying neurobiological substrates. We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can account for individual differences in compassion, focusing on the effects of attachment on caregiving and support. The proposed framework integrates the current scientific understanding of oxytocin function with compassion-related processes. It thus highlights the largely ignored attentional processes in compassion and taps into the vast variability of responses in social contexts involving pain and suffering.

AB  - To characterize learning/memory profiles for the first time in the genetically heterogeneous NIH-HS rat stock, and to examine whether these are associated with anxiety, we evaluated NIH-HS rats for spatial learning/memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and in the following anxiety/fear tests: the elevated zero-maze (ZM; unconditioned anxiety), a context-conditioned fear test and the acquisition of two-way active avoidance (conditioned anxiety). NIH-HS rats were compared with the Roman High- (RHA-I) and Low-Avoidance (RLA-I) rat strains, given the well-known differences between the Roman strains/lines in anxiety-related behavior and in spatial learning/memory. The results show that: (i) As expected, RLA-I rats were more anxious in the ZM test, displayed more frequent context-conditioned freezing episodes and fewer avoidances than RHA-I rats. (ii) Scores of NIH-HS rats in these tests/tasks mostly fell in between those of the Roman rat strains, and were usually closer to the values of the RLA-I strain. (iii) Pigmented NIH-HS (only a small part of NIH-HS rats were albino) rats were the best spatial learners and displayed better spatial memory than the other three (RHA-I, RLA-I and NIH-HS albino) groups. (iv) Albino NIH-HS and RLA-I rats also showed better learning/memory than the RHA-I strain. (v) Within the NIH-HS stock, the most anxious rats in the ZM test presented the best learning and/or memory efficiency (regardless of pigmentation). In summary, NIH-HS rats display a high performance in spatial learning/memory tasks and a passive coping strategy when facing conditioned conflict situations. In addition, unconditioned anxiety in NIH-HS rats predicts better spatial learning/memory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stressful experiences that consistently increase cortisol levels appear to alter the expression of hundreds of genes in prefrontal limbic brain regions. Here, we investigate this hypothesis in monkeys exposed to intermittent social stress-induced episodes of hypercortisolism or a no-stress control condition. Prefrontal profiles of gene expression compiled from Affymetrix microarray data for monkeys randomized to the no-stress condition were consistent with microarray results published for healthy humans. In monkeys exposed to intermittent social stress, more genes than expected by chance appeared to be differentially expressed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex compared to monkeys not exposed to adult social stress. Most of these stress responsive candidate genes were modestly downregulated, including ubiquitin conjugation enzymes and ligases involved in synaptic plasticity, cell cycle progression and nuclear receptor signaling. Social stress did not affect gene expression beyond that expected by chance in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or prefrontal white matter. Thirty four of 48 comparisons chosen for verification by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were consistent with the microarray-predicted result. Furthermore, qPCR and microarray data were highly correlated. These results provide new insights on the regulation of gene expression in a prefrontal corticolimbic region involved in the pathophysiology of stress and major depression. Comparisons between these data from monkeys and those for ventromedial prefrontal cortex in humans with a history of major depression may help to distinguish the molecular signature of stress from other confounding factors in human postmortem brain research.

AB  - In rats, while pregnancy has been reported to increase emotional reactivity, postnatal handling, consisting in a short daily maternal separation during. early life, has been shown to reduce it in several behavioural tests. In the present study, we investigated the potential effects of handling in pregnant rats confronted to various stressful situations. For that purpose, groups of DA/Han female rats were tested either in the elevated plus maze test, in the probe burying test or in a cat exposure test.
   At the age of 10-14 weeks, control and handled females were mated. Pregnant females were isolated (day 0 of gestation) as well as some non-pregnant females (day 0 of isolation). On day 12, pregnant and non-pregnant females were subjected to one of the three emotional reactivity tests.
   Our results show that pregnant females (control and handled) were more reactive than non-pregnant ones in two of the three testing situations, namely the elevated plus maze and the probe burying test. In particular, pregnant females spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze than their non-pregnant counterparts and their number of close sniffing towards the probe was decreased in the burying test. Comparatively, beneficial effects of postnatal handling were obvious in the three experiments, both for non-pregnant and pregnant females. We conclude (1) that pregnancy increases emotional reactivity at day 12 of pregnancy, particularly in tests involving low or mildly stressful conditions, and (2) that postnatal handling can partially reverse those effects in all three tests, even in the more stressful situation represented by the cat exposure.

AB  - A reduction in 5-HT1A receptor response enhances learning and memory performance in rats. Pre- and postnatal treatment with 5-methoxytryptamine (5MT), a non-selective serotonergic agonist, and early handling, reduce the number of 5-HT1A receptors in neonatal and pre-pubertal rat progeny. The aim of this study was to investigate in adolescent male rats the consequences of pre- and postnatal treatment with 5MT and its interaction with early handling on an object-place association learning task, the "Can test", a motivated, non-aversive, spatial/object discrimination task. Results show that a single daily injection of 5MT from gestational days 12 to 21 (1 mg/kg s.c.) and from postnatal days 2 to 18 to pups (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), increases the level of activity and the number of correct responses, and decreases the number of reference memory errors in the progeny as adolescent, compared to vehicle-treated rats. Similar effects are observed following a daily, brief, maternal separation of the pups from postnatal days 2 until 21. Furthermore, when 5MT-treated rats underwent to early handling procedure, the effects induced by 5MT increased handling-induced facilitation of the object-place association. These results suggest that pre- and postnatal treatment with 5MT enhances learning in the "Can test", probably due to a reduction in 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus. Whether the potentiation exerted by pre- and postnatal 5MT on early handling effects may be related to a further damping of 5-HT1A receptor response is not yet assessed; however, our data demonstrate that this association is able to induce long-term facilitative effects on spatial learning performance in a non-aversive spatial/object discrimination task in the adolescent rat offspring.

AB  - The basic question as to whether male laboratory mice should be singly or group housed represents a major animal welfare concern within current laboratory animal legislation and husbandry. To better understand the behavioural and physiological mechanisms underlying this issue, we conducted two longitudinal experiments using C57BL/6J mice. In the first experiment (N = 32), we explored social behaviour of pair housed males from weaning to adulthood. We took weekly measures of agonistic, socio-exploratory and affiliative behaviours within two different contexts, i.e. in the undisturbed home cage and immediately after cage cleaning. In the second experiment (N = 36), we investigated whether separation of male pairs into single housing at different ages (35, 56 or 77 days of age) affected welfare-related measures such as faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) and anxiety-like behaviours. In the first experiment we found that levels of agonistic behaviour were higher after cage cleaning than in the undisturbed cage as expected, but did not significantly change with age in either context. Instead, affiliative behaviour increased with age in the undisturbed home cage. In the second experiment, social separation did not affect levels of FCMs or anxiety-like behaviours at any age point. Taken together, this study shows that pair housed male mice can maintain low levels of aggression across a long period of their life and perform increasing levels of sociopositive behaviours which may serve to promote stable social relations. At the same time, our results suggest that male mice can quickly adapt to separation into single housing at different ages, from adolescence to adulthood. These findings are in line with the behavioural ecology of wild male mice, which suggests that both solitary and group living represent two alternative strategies.

AB  - Infant maternal separation, a paradigm of early life stress in rodents, elicits long-lasting changes in gene expression that persist into adulthood. In BALB/c mice, an inbred strain with spontaneously elevated anxiety and stress reactivity, infant maternal separation led to increased depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress and robustly increased editing of serotonin 2C receptor pre-mRNA. Chronic fluoxetine treatment of adult BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress affected neither their behavioral responses to stress nor their basal 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing phenotype. However, when fluoxetine was administered during adolescence, depression-like behavioral responses to stress were significantly diminished in these mice, and their basal and stress-induced 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing phenotypes were significantly lower. Moreover, when BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress were raised in an enriched postweaning environment, their depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress were also significantly diminished. However, their 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing phenotype remained unaltered. Hence, the similar behavioral effects of enrichment and fluoxetine treatment during adolescence were not accompanied by similar changes in 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing. Enriched and nonenriched BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress also exhibited significantly increased expression of mRNA and protein encoding the G alpha q subunit of G-protein that couples to 5-HT2A/2C receptors. In contrast, G alpha q expression levels were significantly lower in fluoxetine-treated mice. These findings suggest that compensatory changes in G alpha q expression occur in mice with persistently altered 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing and provide an explanation for the dissociation between 5-HT2C receptor editing phenotypes and behavioral stress responses.

AB  - The recent discovery that neurons are born throughout life in specific brain regions has caused explosive interest in the possible involvement of adult neurogenesis in a host of psychiatric conditions. Neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of adult hippocampus dentate gyrus has received the greatest attention to date, since it is highly regulated. In general, several types of deleterious conditions (e.g. stress, drug addiction, advanced age) are associated with reduced neurogenesis in the adult. hippocampus, while palliative conditions (e.g. enriched environment, voluntary exercise, antidepressant treatments) are associated with enhanced neurogenesis. The major limitation in the field today is the lack of direct evidence for an important role of the newly born neurons in hippocampal function. This review provides an overview of preclinical research relating adult neurogenesis to psychiatric disorders, with an emphasis on how such research can provide insight into the functional role of adult neurogenesis. Given that another limitation in the field is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a newly born cell or a newly born neuron, we also provide an overview of the technical challenges facing the field, and suggest guidelines for defining cytogenesis and neurogenesis. In general, we suggest that an improved understanding of adult hippocampal neurogenesis could shed light onto the neurobiological mechanisms underlying certain psychiatric conditions, and might even lead to the development of novel treatments for these disorders.

AB  - In mammals, early adverse experiences, including mother pup interactions, shape the response of an individual to chronic stress or to stress-related diseases during adult life. This has led to the elaboration of the theory of the developmental origins of health and disease, in particular adult diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. In addition, in humans, as stated by Massimo Fagioli's Human Birth Theory, birth is healthy and equal for all individuals, so that mental illness develop exclusively in the postnatal period because of the quality of the relationship in the first year of life. Thus, this review focuses on the importance of programming during the early developmental period on the manifestation of adult diseases in both animal models and humans. Considering the obvious differences between animals and humans we cannot systematically move from animal models to humans. Consequently, in the first part of this review, we will discuss how animal models can be used to dissect the influence of adverse events occurring during the prenatal and postnatal periods on the developmental trajectories of the offspring, and in the second part, we will discuss the role of postnatal critical periods on the development of mental diseases in humans. Epigenetic mechanisms that cause reversible modifications in gene expression, driving the development of a pathological phenotype in response to a negative early postnatal environment, may lie at the core of this programming, thereby providing potential new therapeutic targets. The concept of the Human Birth Theory leads to a comprehension of the mental illness as a pathology of the human relationship immediately after birth and during the first year of life. (C) 2016 IBRO.

AB  - Numerous studies have investigated the emotional effects of various acute, potentially alarming events in animals, but little is known about how an accumulation of emotional experiences affects fearfulness. Fearfulness is a temperament trait that characterizes the propensity of an individual to be frightened by a variety of alarming events. The aim of this study was to investigate a putative alteration of fearfulness in sheep repeatedly exposed to various aversive events. Forty-eight 5-month-old female lambs were used. Over a period of 6 weeks, 24 of them (treated group) were exposed daily to various unpredictable and uncontrollable aversive events related to predatory cues, social context and negative handling that can occur under farming conditions. The other 24 lambs (control group) were housed in standard farming conditions (predictable food distribution and group handling). Fearfulness (behavioural and physiological responses) was assessed before and after the treatment period by subjecting the lambs to three standardized tests: individual exposure to suddenness and then to novelty in a test arena, and group exposure to a motionless human in the home pen. As biomarkers of stress, leukocyte counts, heart rate and cortisol concentrations were measured in the lambs in their home pens. Before the treatment, the emotional responses of the groups did not differ. After the treatment, treated lambs approached the human less often, had less contact with the novel object and vocalized more than controls in individual tests, suggesting that long-term exposure to unpredictable and uncontrollable aversive events increases subsequent fearfulness in sheep. In addition, treated lambs had lower leukocyte counts, heart rate and cortisol levels, pointing to a chronic stress state. These findings suggest that increased fearfulness may be used as a sign of chronic stress in farm animals.

AB  - The transition from controlled drug use to drug addiction depends on an interaction between a vulnerable individual, their environment and a drug. Here we tested the hypothesis that conditions under which individuals live influence behavioral vulnerability traits and experiential factors operating in the drug taking environment to determine the vulnerability to addiction. The role of behavioral vulnerability traits in mediating the influence of housing conditions on the tendency to acquire cocaine self-administration was characterized in 48 rats housed in either an enriched (EE) or a standard (SE) environment. Then, the influence of these housing conditions on the individual vulnerability to develop addiction-like behavior for cocaine or alcohol was measured in 72 EE or SE rats after several months of cocaine self-administration or intermittent alcohol drinking, respectively. The determining role of negative experiential factors in the drug taking context was further investigated in 48 SE rats that acquired alcohol drinking to self-medicate distress in a schedule-induced polydipsia procedure. The environment influenced the acquisition of drug intake through its effect on behavioral markers of resilience to addiction. In contrast, the initiation of drug taking as a coping strategy or in a negative state occasioned by the contrast between enriched housing conditions and a relatively impoverished drug taking setting, facilitated the development of compulsive cocaine and alcohol intake. These data indicate that addiction vulnerability depends on environmentally determined experiential factors, and suggest that initiating drug use through negative reinforcement-based self-medication facilitates the development of addiction in vulnerable individuals.
   Significance statement: The factors that underlie an individual's vulnerability to switch from controlled, recreational drug use to addiction are not well understood. We showed that in individuals housed in enriched conditions, the experience of drugs in the relative social and sensory impoverishment of the drug taking context, and the associated change in behavioral traits of resilience to addiction, exacerbate the vulnerability to develop compulsive drug intake. We further demonstrated that the acquisition of alcohol drinking as a mechanism to cope with distress increases the vulnerability to develop compulsive alcohol intake. Together these results demonstrate that experiential factors in the drug taking context shape the vulnerability to addiction.

AB  - The study of emotions in animals is of increasing importance to a number of disciplines such as animal welfare science and affective neuroscience. Pigs are a common farm animal species, most often reared in intensive systems. Moreover, they are increasingly being used in laboratories. To accurately understand the welfare needs of these animals, we need to be able to study emotion, the assumption being that positive emotional states contribute to good welfare, while negative states result in reduced welfare. A variety of methods have been proposed to study emotions in animals through behaviour, many of which have been applied to pigs. This review will focus on the methods by which behaviour can be used to study emotion in pigs. First, we discuss the variety of behavioural tests that have been applied to study emotion and mood in pigs. We propose a list of criteria with which to evaluate the behavioural tests and discuss each test with respect to these criteria as well as any behavioural, physiological or pharmacological validation. Second, we look at specific behaviours or behaviour patterns that may also be indicative of emotion and mood in pigs. We find a number of issues with the more commonly used behavioural tests, including the lack of ethologically valid test designs, and the need for greater standardisation of design which would facilitate comparison of results across studies. Furthermore, behaviours measured are often not specific to emotion, or sensitive to subtle differences in emotion. Suggestions for improvements to the current methods are given with a focus on species relevant behaviour and the potential for assessing both positive and negative emotions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For farmed species, good health and welfare is a win-win situation: both the animals and producers can benefit. In recent years, animal welfare scientists have embraced cognitive sciences to rise to the challenge of determining an animal's internal state in order to better understand its welfare needs and by extension, the needs of larger groups of animals. A wide range of cognitive tests have been developed that can be applied in farmed species to assess a range of cognitive traits. However, this has also presented challenges. Whilst it may be expected to see cognitive variation at the species level, differences in cognitive ability between and within individuals of the same species have frequently been noted but left largely unexplained. Not accounting for individual variation may result in misleading conclusions when the results are applied both at an individual level and at higher levels of scale. This has implications both for our fundamental understanding of an individual's welfare needs, but also more broadly for experimental design and the justification for sample sizes in studies using animals. We urgently need to address this issue. In this review, we will consider the latest developments on the causes of individual variation in cognitive outcomes, such as the choice of cognitive test, sex, breed, age, early life environment, rearing conditions, personality, diet, and the animal's microbiome. We discuss the impact of each of these factors specifically in relation to recent work in farmed species, and explore the future directions for cognitive research in this field, particularly in relation to experimental design and analytical techniques that allow individual variation to be accounted for appropriately.

AB  - Studies of the cognitive abilities of pigs are increasing in number, due to their relevance for the fields of animal welfare and biomedical research. While both female and male pigs have been used in cognitive tasks, possible sex differences in performance have not yet received extensive attention. This is of interest, as sexual dimorphism in cognitive abilities has been documented for a variety of species. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of sex on pigs' performance in two cognitive tasks. Spatial learning and memory of ten female and ten male pigs was compared in a spatial holeboard task. Working and reference memory, as well as measures of motivation and exploration were assessed. Both females and males acquired the task and no differences were found between sexes for any measures of spatial memory. However, female pigs performed more successfully during reversal trials (shorter latency to first reward, higher number of rewards found), indicating greater response flexibility. This difference between sexes was transient, with males eventually reaching the same level of performance as the females. Judgment bias, a cognitive measure of affective state, was subsequently assessed using an active choice judgment bias task. Pigs were trained to respond differently to a negative and a positive stimulus, signaling either a small or a large reward. During judgment bias testing, pigs were presented with ambiguous cues and their trained 'positive' and 'negative' responses were recorded as optimistic or pessimistic choices, respectively. Both females and males displayed a slightly optimistic judgment bias. Optimistic choosing decreased with repeated testing for both groups. It is likely the pigs learned about the unrewarded outcome of ambiguous cues, rendering them no longer ambiguous. Further improvement of the judgment bias task as a cognitive measure of affective state is deemed necessary. Overall, our results indicate that sex is not a confounding factor when measuring baseline performance of pigs in the spatial holeboard or judgment bias task. Sex effects were only found when subjecting the pigs to a reversal task, warranting further study of sex differences in response flexibility. Such a difference would have implications for pig welfare, as it suggests that males are slower to cope with changes in their environment. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The mammalian hippocampus continues to generate new neurons throughout life. Experiences such as exercise, anti-depressants, and stress regulate levels of neurogenesis. Exercise increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis and enhances behavioral performance on rotarod, contextual fear and water maze in rodents. To directly test whether intact neurogenesis is required for gains in behavioral performance from exercise in C57BL/6J mice, neurogenesis was reduced using focal gamma irradiation (3 sessions of 5 Gy). Two months after treatment, mice (total n=42 males and 42 females) (irradiated or Sham), were placed with or without running wheels (Runner or Sedentary) for 54 days. The first 10 days mice received daily injections of bromodeoxyuricline (BrdU) to label dividing cells. The last 14 days mice were tested on water maze (two trials per day for 5 days, then 1 h later probe test), rotarod (four trials per day for 3 days), and contextual fear conditioning (2 days), then measured for neurogenesis using immunohistochemical detection of BrdU and neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) mature neuronal marker. Consistent with previous studies, in Sham animals, running increased neurogenesis fourfold and gains in performance were observed for the water maze (spatial learning and memory), rotarod (motor performance), and contextual fear (conditioning). These positive results provided the reference to determine whether gains in performance were blocked by irradiation. Irradiation reduced neurogenesis by 50% in both groups, Runner and Sedentary. Irradiation did not affect running or baseline performance on any task. Minimal changes in microglia associated with inflammation (using immunohistochemical detection of cd68) were detected at the time of behavioral testing. Irradiation did not reduce gains in performance on rotarod or contextual fear, however it eliminated gain in performance on the water maze.

AB  - Delta FosB is a transcription factor and a member of Fos family proteins. It has been identified to be a factor both in physiological reward-seeking behavior and in development of addiction. Its expression in the nucleus accumbens in response to chronic stimulation of the reward system triggers neuroplasticity in this system. Although Delta FosB expression increases in response to many different stimuli, its exact effects differ depending strictly on the brain region and type of neurons in which the expression takes place. Among stimuli known to induce Delta FosB expression are exercise, sexual activity, calorie-rich foods and stress, but also psychoactive drugs (stimulants, opioids, alcohol, tobacco, propofol), electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotics of both generations and antidepressants. Increased Delta FosB levels in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons with dominant D1 receptor expression have been associated in mice with stress resilience, but also with increased susceptibility to developing an addiction and higher frequency of risky behaviors. Increased Delta FosB expression in the same neuron type, but with dominant D2 receptor has been observed after rearing mice in a mentally enriching environment and following high-sucrose drink consumption. Decreased Delta FosB levels have been demonstrated post mortem in the nucleus accumbens in patients suffering from depression and in the prefrontal cortex after chronic antipsychotic drug administration. The Delta FosB half-life is exceptionally long - this protein has been shown to last even for several months after cessation of the stimuli - and it accumulates following chronic stimulation. Both its abnormal stability and neuroplasticity-inducing properties could explain the chronic course of addiction.

AB  - Major depression is hypothesized to be associated with dysregulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for several effects of antidepressants and increasing the rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) before exposure to chronic corticosterone is sufficient to protect against its harmful effects on behavior. However, it is an open question if increasing AHN after the onset of chronic stress exposure would be able to rescue behavioral deficits and which mechanisms might be involved in recovery. We investigated this question by using a 10-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model on a transgenic mouse line (iBax mice), in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax can be inducibly ablated in neural stem cells following Tamoxifen injection, therefore enhancing the survival of newborn neurons in the adult brain. We did not observe any effect of our treatment in non-stress conditions, but we did find that increasing AHN after 2 weeks of UCMS is sufficient to counteract the effects of UCMS on certain behaviors (splash test and changes in coat state) and endocrine levels and thus to display some antidepressant-like effects. We observed that increasing AHN lowered the elevated basal corticosterone levels in mice exposed to UCMS. This was accompanied by a tamoxifen-induced reversal of the lack of stress-induced decrease in neuronal activation in the anteromedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMA) after intrahippocampal dexamethasone infusion, pointing to a possible mechanism through which adult-born neurons might have exerted their effects. Our results contribute to the neurogenesis hypothesis of depression by suggesting that increasing AHN may be beneficial not just before, but also after exposure to stress by counteracting several of its effects, in part through regulating the HPA axis.

AB  - Coffee or caffeine has recently been suggested as prophylaxis for dementia. Although memory problems are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, this dementia is also characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms called Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). The impact of preventive/therapeutic strategies on both cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms can be addressed in the 3xTg-AD mice, since they exhibit cognitive but also BPSD-like profiles. Here, we studied the long-term effects of a low dose of caffeine in male 3xTg-AD mice and as compared to age-matched non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging. Animals were treated (water or caffeine in drinking water) from adulthood (6 months of age) until middle-aged (13 months of age), that in 3xTg-AD mice correspond to onset of cognitive impairment and advanced stages, respectively. The low caffeine dosing used (0.3 mg/ml) was previously found to give a plasma concentration profile in mice roughly equivalent to that of a human coffee drinker. There were significant effects of caffeine on most behavioral variables, especially those related to neophobia and other anxiety-like behaviors, emotionality, and cognitive flexibility. The 3xTg-AD and NTg mice were differently influenced by caffeine. Overall, the increase of neophobia and other anxiety-related behaviors resulted in an exacerbation of BPSD-like profile in 3xTg-AD mice. Learning and memory, strongly influenced by anxiety in 3xTg-AD mice, got little benefit from caffeine, only shown after a detailed analysis of navigation strategies. The worsened pattern in NTg mice and the use of search strategies in 3xTg-AD mice make both groups more similar. Circadian motor activity showed genotype differences, which were found to be enhanced by caffeine. Selective effects of caffeine on NTg were found in the modulation of behaviors related to emotional profile and risk assessment. Caffeine normalized splenomegaly of 3xTg-AD mice, a physical indicator of their impaired peripheral immune system, and trended to increase their corticosterone levels. Our observations of adverse caffeine effects in an Alzheimer's disease model together with previous clinical observations suggest that an exacerbation of BPSD-like symptoms may partly interfere with the beneficial cognitive effects of caffeine. These results are relevant when coffee-derived new potential treatments for dementia are to be devised and tested.

AB  - Predation is one of the main factors responsible for the failure of reintroduction/translocation programs. Animal's personality and sex can also influence key behaviors for survival and reproduction. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of anti-predator training, personality and sex on the survival and behaviors of translocated blue-fronted Amazon parrots. Thirty-one captive-raised parrots were translocated to a Cerrado area in Brazil. Parrots were separated into two groups: anti-predator trained group (ATG) and control group (CG). Personality tests were performed with individuals of the ATG group. Data were collected using focal sampling with instantaneous recording of behavior every minute. Anti-predator training, personality and sex did not influenced parrots' survival after release. However, anti-predator training proved to be efficient in eliciting more natural behaviors in parrots after release. Shy individuals and males showed to be more sociable than bold individuals and females. Personality and sex did not influence behavior exhibition. Parrots interacted more, positively or negatively, with individuals of its own group. Training session closer to the release date should be tried. Behavioral data and not just survival rates should be used to evaluate the efficiency of the techniques, because behavior can give clues about the adaptation of the individuals to the new habitat, increasing the success of the conservation program.

AB  - Chronic stress is associated with negative health outcomes and is linked with neuroendocrine changes, deleterious effects on innate and adaptive immunity, and central nervous system neuropathology. Although stress management is commonly advocated clinically, there is insufficient mechanistic understanding of how decreasing stress affects disease pathogenesis. Therefore, we have developed a "calm mouse model" with caging enhancements designed to reduce murine stress. Male BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: control (Cntl), standard caging; calm (Calm), large caging to reduce animal density, a cardboard nest box for shelter, paper nesting material to promote innate nesting behavior, and a polycarbonate tube to mimic tunneling; control exercise (Cntl Ex), standard caging with a running wheel, known to reduce stress; and calm exercise (Calm Ex), calm caging with a running wheel. Calm, Cntl Ex and Calm Ex animals exhibited significantly less corticosterone production than Cntl animals. We also observed changes in spleen mass, and in vitro splenocyte studies demonstrated that Calm Ex animals had innate and adaptive immune responses that were more sensitive to acute handling stress than those in Cntl. Calm animals gained greater body mass than Cntl, although they had similar food intake: and we also observed changes in body composition, using magnetic resonance imaging. Together, our results suggest that the Calm mouse model represents a promising approach to studying the biological effects of stress reduction in the context of health and in conjunction with existing disease models.

AB  - Various pleasant sensations that give a particularly intense pleasure are able to improve anxiety. In the present study I consider the possibility that their anti-anxiety action depends on the strong pleasure they provide, and I propose a possible mechanism of this action. According to some studies, also appetitive aggression (an aggression that provokes a strong pleasure and that is performed only for the pleasure it provides) can improve anxiety, and in this article I consider the possibility that the pleasure of appetitive aggression is able to reduce anxiety by the same mechanism I have proposed for other intense pleasurable sensations.
   The aggression performed by a child against the mother or against a substitute for the mother in the first period of life (a period in which this aggression is not dangerous) is a recurring theme throughout the work of of Donald Winnicott. Winnicott stresses that this aggression is necessary for the normal development of the child, and that the child must be free to practise it. According to Winnicott, this aggression is highly pleasurable and is not a response to unpleasant or hostile external situations. For these characteristics it seems to correspond to appetitive aggression in the adult that has been found to be able to reduce anxiety. Consequently, aggression performed by the child in the first period of life may also relieve anxiety, in the same way that appetitive aggression helps against anxiety in the adult.
   In his writings, Winnicott returns several times to an unthinkable or archaic anxiety that children experience when they feel abandoned by their mother for a period that is too long for them, and all children, according to Winnicott, live on the brink of this anxiety. In this study I propose the hypothesis that aggression in the early period of life may be necessary for children because the intense pleasure it provides may help them against this continuously impending anxiety.

AB  - Impaired social behavior is a common feature of many psychiatric disorders, in particular with substance abuse disorders. Switching the preference of the substance-dependent individual toward social interaction activities remains one of the major challenges in drug dependence therapy. However, social interactions yield to the emergence of social ranking. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that examined how social status can influence the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and how drug-seeking behavior is affected. Generally, social dominance is associated with an increase in dopamine D-2/3 receptor binding in the striatum and a reduced behavioral response to drugs of abuse. However, it is not clear whether higher D-2 receptor availability is a result of increased D-2 receptor density and/or reduced dopamine release in the striatum. Here, we discuss the possibility of a potential shift from down to top rank via manipulation of the mesolimbic system. Identifying the neurobiology underlying a potential rank switch to a resilient phenotype is of particular interest in order to promote a positive coping behavior toward long-term abstinence from drugs of abuse and a protection against relapse to drugs. Such a shift may contribute to a more successful therapeutic approach to cocaine addiction.

AB  - Metabolic cages are a type of housing used in biomedical research. Metabolic cage housing has been demonstrated to elicit behavioural and physiological changes in rodents housed within them. The nature of this effect has been characterized as anxiogenic. However, few studies have evaluated positive affect in response to metabolic cage housing and the interaction between this, sex and traditional physiological measures of stress. Cognitive biasing, as measured through a judgment bias paradigm has proven a reliable measure of animal affective state, particularly through its ability to measure positive affect. The current study investigated differences in cognitive biasing between male and female rats when transferred from open-top, grouped housing to a metabolic cage. Rats (Rattus norvegicus) (n = 60) were trained in a judgment bias paradigm previously validated for use in the rat model. Upon exposure to an intermediate, ambiguous probe rats responded with either an optimistic or pessimistic decision. The animals were also subjected to the sucrose preference test to identify the presence of anhedonia. Faecal corticosterone and changes in adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase were also measured to establish whether a stress-like state was experienced. There was a significant interaction between sex and metabolic cage housing on the number of optimistic decisions made F (I, 56) = 7.461,p = 0.008. Female rats that remained in control housing responded with a reduced number of days featuring an optimistic decision compared to males in control housing (p = 0.036). However, both males and females responded with significantly fewer optimistic decisions in the metabolic cage compared to control (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between treatment and sucrose consumption (r(pb) = -0.654, n = 195, p < 0.001). There was also a significant sex effect for faecal corticosterone concentrations F (1, 30) = 6305, p = 0.018) with female rats (4.050 +/- 1.285), displaying greater corticosterone concentrations than males (2291 +/- 0.495). No differences between treatment were observed for either corticosterone or tyrosine hydroxylase levels. This data demonstrates that movement into a metabolic cage resulted in rats displaying significantly greater pessimistic cognitive biases as determined through the judgment bias test. Interestingly, male rats that remained in control housing demonstrated cognitive biases that were not equivalent to female rats. Furthermore, despite a behavioural change being evident, a physiological change in corticosterone or tyrosine hydroxylase levels was not observed. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Little is known about the influence of rearing environments concurrent with voluntary intermittent access to ethanol on subsequent adult ethanol-related behaviors. Previous research has shown that adult rats reared in post-weaning, social isolation conditions (IC) respond more for operant ethanol compared to laboratory standard conditions (SC). Ethanol-exposed adolescents tend to consume more ethanol in adulthood than rats exposed as adults. The current study examined voluntary ethanol consumption during adolescence between IC and SC rats, subsequent operant responding for ethanol, and extinction of responding in the same rats as adults. Differences in ethanol metabolism may alter the amount of reward value per unit of ethanol consumed. Therefore, the current study also examined blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) between IC rats and SC rats. Ethanol-naive Long-Evans rats arrived in the lab at postnatal day (PND) 21 and were separated into either IC or SC where they remained for the duration of the experiments. On PND 27, rats received intermittent access to 20% ethanol (3 days/week) for 4 or 6 weeks. Rats in the 6-week cohort were then trained to lever press for 20% ethanol in 30-min sessions followed by extinction. A separate cohort was reared in IC or SC, injected with 1.5 or 3.0 g/kg of ethanol (intraperitoneally [i.p.]), followed by BEC measurement. Overall, IC rats had higher ethanol preference and consumption during adolescence/early adulthood. IC and SC rats did not differ in their rates of operant responding for ethanol, and SC rats responded more than IC rats during extinction. There were no differences in BEC between IC and SC rats. These findings highlight the importance of the environment during rat adolescent development with isolation conditions increasing binge-like drinking and ethanol preference after 3-4 weeks without differences in metabolism as a potential factor. Additionally, the findings indicate that intermittent adolescent access to ethanol may change typical differences in operant responding patterns between IC and SC rats in adulthood.

AB  - Introduction: Stereotypical expression in laboratory-housed rodents can be explained by different motivational, coping, and motor dysfunction theories. Here, we aimed to explore the neurocognitive underpinnings of high stereotypical (HS) expression in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii), previously proposed as a model system of compulsive-like behavioral persistence. Specifically, we aimed to establish whether HS behavior is related to an underlying escape-related trigger.Methods: One-hundred and sixteen deer mice were classified as either non-stereotypical (NS) or HS. Mice of each cohort were further subdivided and exposed to either sub-acute (3-day) or chronic (25-day) behavioral restriction (R), and high-dose escitalopram (ESC), lorazepam (LOR), alone and in combination with R (ESC+R and LOR+R, respectively). Mice were reassessed for stereotypical behavior at both time points.Results: Our results indicate that HS behavior is likely not temporally and functionally related to an anxiogenic trigger, i.e., R, but rather that HS is associated with parallel changes in anxiogenic feedback processing. We also show that chronic R alone significantly decreased the time spent in expressing HS behavior in animals of the HS, but not NS phenotype.Discussion: This points to the possibility that HS-expressing mice represent a subgroup of P. maniculatus bairdii in which unique interactions between neurobiology and processes of gradual behavioral organization, may contribute to the expression of the typical behaviors observed in this cohort. Collectively, our findings highlight the value of the deer mouse model system to investigate the potential neurocognitive mechanisms that may underlie the development of persistent phenotypes that can likely not be explained entirely by current theories.

AB  - Stress plays an important role in the development of affective disorders. Women show a higher prevalence for these disorders than men. The course of a depression is thought to be positively influenced by social support. We have used a chronic stress model in which rats received foot-shocks daily for 3 weeks. Since rats are social animals we hypothesised that 'social support' might reduce the adverse effects of chronic stress. To test this hypothesis, male and female rats were housed individually or socially in unisex groups of four rats. The proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected 2 weeks before the sacrifice to investigate if stress and social housing influenced the survival of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus (DG). To investigate changes in proliferation, another group of rats was sacrificed the day after the last BrdU injection. Stress significantly decreased BrdU labelling in individually housed males and not significantly in socially housed males. In individually housed females stress increased BrdU labelling, which was prevented by social housing. The increase found in females is most likely caused by differences in survival rate, since cell proliferation was not affected by stress or housing conditions. These results indicate that social support can affect neurogenesis in both female and male rats, however in a different way. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Early developmental insults can cause dysfunction within parvalbumin (PVB)-containing interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. The neuropsychiatric disorders associated with such dysfunction might involve neuroinflammatory processes. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator of inflammation and is therefore a potential target for preventive treatment. Here, we investigated whether the developmental trajectories of PVB expression and COX-2 induction in the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex are altered after maternal separation stress in male rats.
   Methods: Male rat pups were separated from their mother and littermates for 4 hours/day between postnatal Days 2 and 20. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze PVB and COX-2 expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. A separate cohort of animals was treated with a COX-2 inhibitor during preadolescence and analyzed for PVB, COX-2, and working memory performance.
   Results: We demonstrate that maternal separation causes a reduction of PVB and an increase in COX-2 expression in the prefrontal cortex in adolescence, with concurrent working memory deficits. Parvalbumin was not affected earlier in development. Prophylactic COX-2 inhibition preadolescence prevents PVB loss and improves working memory deficits induced by maternal separation.
   Conclusions: These data are the first to show a preventive pharmacological intervention for the delayed effects of early life stress on prefrontal cortex interneurons and working memory. Our results suggest a possible mechanism for the relationship between early life stress and interneuron dysfunction in adolescence.

AB  - Ethanol exposure and early life stress during brain development are associated with an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders. We used a third-trimester equivalent model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders combined with a maternal separation (MS) protocol to evaluate whether these stressors cause sexually dimorphic behavioral and hippocampal dendritic arborization responses in adolescent rats. Wistar rat pups were divided into four experimental groups: 1) Control; 2) MS (MS, for 3 h/day from postnatal (PND) 2 to PND14); 3) EtOH (EtOH, 5 g/kg/day, i.p., PND2, 4, 6, 8, and 10); 4) EtOH + MS. All animals were divided into two cohorts and subjected to a battery of behavioral tests when they reached adolescence (PND37-44). Animals from cohort 1 were submitted to: 1) the open field test; 2) self-cleaning behavior (PND38); and 3) the motivation test (PND39-41). Animals from cohort 2 were submitted to: 1) the novel object recognition (PND37-39); 2) social investigation test (PND40); and 3) Morris water maze test (PND41-44). At PND45, the animals were euthanized, and the brains were collected for subsequent dendritic analysis. Postnatal ethanol exposure (PEE) caused anxietylike behavior in females and reduced motivation, and increased hippocampal dendritic arborization in both sexes. MS reduced body weight, increased locomotor activity in females, and increased motivation, and hippocampal dendritic arborization in both sexes. We found that males from the EtOH + MS groups are more socially engaged than females, who were more interested in sweets than males. Altogether, these data suggest that early life adverse conditions may alter behavior in a sex-dependent manner in adolescent rats.

AB  - Pre-clinical early-life stress paradigms model early adverse events in humans. However, the long-term behavioral consequences of early-life adversities after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adults have not been examined. In addition, endocannabinoids may protect against TBI neuropathology. Hence, the current study assessed the ef-fects of adverse stress during adolescence on emotional and cognitive performance in rats sustaining a TBI as adults, and how cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) activation impacts the outcome. On postnatal days (PND) 30-60, adolescent male rats were exposed to four weeks of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), followed by four weeks of no stress (PND 60-90), or no stress at any time (Control), and then anesthetized and provided a cortical impact of moderate severity (2.8 mm tissue deformation at 4 m/s) or sham injury. TBI and Sham rats (CUS and Control) were administered either arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA; 1 mg/kg, i.p.), a CB1 receptor agonist, or vehicle (VEH; 1 mL/kg, i.p.) immediately after surgery and once daily for 7 days. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in an open field test (OFT) and learning and memory in novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. No differences were revealed among the Sham groups in any behavioral assessment and thus the groups were pooled. In the ACEA and VEH-treated TBI groups, CUS increased exploration in the OFT, enhanced NOR focus, and decreased the time to reach the escape platform in the MWM, suggesting decreased anxiety and enhanced learning and memory relative to the Control group receiving VEH (p < 0.05). ACEA also enhanced NOR and MWM performance in the Control + TBI group (p < 0.05). These data suggest that 4 weeks of CUS provided during adolescence may provide protection against TBI acquired during adulthood and/or induce adaptive behavioral responses. Moreover, CB1 receptor agonism produces benefits after TBI independent of CUS protection.

AB  - Simple Summary Dogs are a social species and may experience negative emotions when left alone even for short periods of time. This study explored the effectiveness of different food-based enrichments on engaging dogs, and alleviating potential negative emotional states caused by social isolation. The results indicated that dogs spent the most time interacting with a long-lasting chew. They also responded to this enrichment with the most positive and calm emotions when compared to a treat-dispensing toy and a smart treat-dispensing device. Long-lasting chews should be further explored as an enrichment for improving dog emotional wellbeing during periods of separation from their caregivers. Dogs may experience negative emotional states when isolated from human caregivers and conspecifics. This study aimed to evaluate how dogs interact with different enrichments during a short period of social isolation, as a first step towards identifying methods for improving their emotional wellbeing. Using a cross-over design, dogs (n = 20) at the Waltham Petcare Science Institute were exposed to four different food-based enrichments while left alone in a familiar room for 20 min: long-lasting chew (Chew), kibble in a treat-dispensing toy (Toy), and kibble dispensed through a smart treat-dispensing device with (Device + Voice) and without (Device) a person talking to the dog. Time spent engaging with each enrichment item and emotional valence and arousal (7-point scale collected every 5-min) were scored from videos. The results of linear mixed models indicated Chew was the most successful enrichment, with dogs having lower arousal scores (p < 0.05 vs. Device and Toy) during the first five minutes of isolation, higher positive valence scores (p < 0.05 vs. all) during the second five minutes of isolation, and spending the most total time engaged (p < 0.01 vs. all). Based on these findings, long-lasting chews should be further explored to assess their impact on dog emotional wellbeing.

AB  - Although gene-environment interactions are known to significantly influence psychopathology related disease states, only few animal models cover both the genetic background and environmental manipulations. Therefore, we have taken advantage of the bidirectionally inbred high (HAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior mouse lines to generate HAB x LAB F1 hybrids that intrinsically carry both lines' genetic characteristics, and subsequently raised them in three different environments standard, enriched (EE) and chronic mild stress (CMS). Assessing genetic correlates of trait anxiety, we focused on two genes already known to play a role in HAB vs. LAB mice, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor type 1 (Crhr1) and high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3 (Hmgn3). While EE F1 mice showed decreased anxiety related and increased explorative behaviors compared to controls, CMS sparked effects in the opposite direction. However, environmental treatments affected the expression of the two genes in distinct ways. Thus, while expression ratios of Hmgn3 between the HAB- and LAB-specific alleles remained equal, total expression resembled the one observed in HAB vs. LAB mice, i.e., decreased after EE and increased after CMS treatment. On the other hand, while total expression of Crhr1 remained unchanged between the groups, the relative expression of HAB- and LAB-specific alleles showed a clear effect following the environmental modifications. Thus, the environmentally driven bidirectional shift of trait anxiety in this F1 model strongly correlated with Hmgn3 expression, irrespective of allele-specific expression patterns that retained the proportions of basic differential HAB vs. LAB expression, making this gene a match for environment-induced modifications. An involvement of Crhr1 in the bidirectional behavioral shift could, however, rather be due to different effects of the HAB- and LAB specific alleles described here. Both candidate genes therefore deserve attention in the complex regulation of anxiety-related phenotypes including environment-mediated effects.

AB  - In adult rodents, decreasing hippocampal neurogenesis experimentally using different approaches often impairs performance in hippocampus-dependent processes. Nonetheless, functional relevance of adult neurogenesis is far from being unraveled, and deficits so far described in animal models often lack reproducibility. One hypothesis is that such differences might be the consequence of the extent of the methodological specificity used to alter neurogenesis rather than the extent to which adult neurogenesis is altered. To address this, we focused on cranial irradiation, the most widely used technique to impair hippocampal neurogenesis and consequentially induce hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits. To investigate the specificity of the technique, we thus exposed 4-5 months old female cyclin D2 knockout mice, a model lacking physiological levels of olfactory and hippocampal neurogenesis, to an X-ray dose of 10 Gy, reported to specifically affect transiently amplifying precursors. After a recovery period of 1.5 months, behavioral tests were performed and probed for locomotor activity, habituation, anxiety, and spatial learning and memory. Spatial learning in the Morris water maze was intact in all experimental groups. Although spatial memory retention assessed 24 h following acquisition was also intact in all mice, irradiated wild type and cyclin D2 knockout mice displayed memory deficits one week after acquisition. In addition, we observed significant differences in tests addressing anxiety and locomotor activity dependent on the technique used to alter neurogenesis. Whereas irradiated mice were hyperactive regardless of their genotype, cyclin D2 knockout mice were hypoactive in most of the tests and displayed altered habituation. The present study emphasizes that different approaches aimed at decreasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis may result in distinct behavioral impairments related to locomotion and anxiety. In contrast, spatial long-term memory retention is consistently altered after both approaches suggesting a plausible implication of hippocampal neurogenesis in this cognitive process.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Different inbred mouse strains but also each animal of the same strain show an individually different stress response which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors such as early life experiences. In this study, we investigated consequences of mild postnatal stress exposure on the stress coping style of adult BALB/c mice.
   METHODS: We used a model of mild early life stress where neonatal mice were repeatedly separated from the dam staying with their siblings for I-h each day during the first two postnatal weeks. The environment during maternal separation was adapted to the nest (bedding, 37 degrees C warm).
   RESULTS: Adult female BALB/s mice that underwent the maternal separation protocol or were not isolated from the dam in early life were exposed to combined acoustic and restraint stress in adulthood. Repeated maternal separation which was performed under ambient conditions increased the stress coping ability of mice at the age of 12 weeks when exposed to this psychological stressors. By acoustic and restraint stress-induced alterations such as high corticosterone levels, an anti-inflammatory immune conditioning with an ex vivo hyperinducibility of interleukin-10 of splenocytes and a massive loss of body weight were significantly reduced in the maternally separated group compared with conventionally bred control mice.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mild maternal separation in early life modifies the stress coping style of adult female BALB/c mice to a more stress-resistant phenotype which shows reduced repeated stress-induced immune suppression and weight loss and is linked to reduced release of glucocorticoids after stress exposure.

AB  - Introduction: We have shown in previous work that acute episodes of predator exposure occurring in the context of chronic social instability produced PTSDlike sequelae in rats. Our animal model of PTSD contained two components: (1) acute trauma, immobilization of rats in close proximity to a cat twice in 10 days, and (2) chronic social instability, 31 days of randomized housing of cage cohorts. Here we tested the hypothesis that daily social stimulation would block the development of the PTSD-like sequelae. Methods: Beginning 24 h after the first cat exposure, adult male rats were given our established PTSD model, alone or in conjunction with daily social stimulation, in which all rats within a group interacted in a large apparatus for 2 h each day for the final 30 days of the PTSD regimen. All behavioral, for example, anxiety, memory, startle testing, and physiological assessments, for example, body growth, organ weights, and corticosterone levels, took place following completion of the psychosocial stress period. Results: Daily social stimulation blocked the expression of a subset of PTSD-like effects, including predator-based cued fear conditioning, enhanced startle response, heightened anxiety on the elevated plus maze and the stress-induced suppression of growth rate. We also found that social stimulation and psychosocial stress produced equivalent outcomes in some measures, including adrenal and heart hypertrophy, thymus atrophy, and a reduction in poststress corticosterone levels. Conclusions: Daily exposure of rats to a highly social environment blocked the development of a subset of trauma-induced sequelae, particularly fear-related outcomes. It is notable that daily social stimulation normalized a subset, but not all, of the PTSD-like effects. We discuss our findings in the context of the literature demonstrating that social stimulation can counteract the adverse effects of traumatic stress on behavioral and physiological measures, as well as to produce its own stress-like outcomes.

AB  - We have studied the effects of exercise in aged rats (18 months-old) on spatial learning and changes in neuronal metabolic activity associated with exercise program and the spatial learning process. The changes on neuronal oxidative metabolic activity was studied through cytochrome c oxidase histochemistry (COx) in brain regions related to spatial memory, reward, and motor activity after a forced exercise program on Rotarod. The spatial learning task was performed in the 4 arm-radial arm water maze (4-RAWM). Exercise program improved slightly the performance, with more percentage of entries into the correct arm along the days. Respect to COx activity, exercise increased the basal oxidative metabolism in frontal regions, such as motor, cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, and in central and basolateral amygdala. In the spatial memory task, the exercise group showed lower COx activity than the non-exercise group in prefrontal cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, tegmental ventral area and supramammillary nucleus, but the neuronal activity increased in the motor cortex in exercised group. These results suggest that our exercise program produces a more accurate performance and it increased efficiency, because the exercise group had lower neuronal metabolic needs in the regions implicated in the spatial memory process. Also, the reduction of COx activity in brain regions traditionally related to stress and some behavioral parameters, such as the lower velocity or more time spent in the center of the maze, may indicate a possible reduction of anxiety in the exercise group during the spatial task.

AB  - Over the recent years, the captive population of the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes; ferret) has experienced a decline in normal sperm (NS) morphology (from 50% to 16%), which may be linked to inbreeding depression or it may have been a dietary change. We examined the role of dietary vitamin E, selenium (SE), and vitamin A on serum levels of vitamin E, SE, and vitamin A and semen quality. Ferrets (n = 55 males) were randomly assigned to one of five diet treatments (n = 11 per treatment): (1) horsemeat diet (control); (2) horsemeat diet + vitamin E (400 IU/kg Dry Matter) daily; (3) horsemeat diet + whole prey; (4) horsemeat diet + vitamin E daily + whole prey; and (5) beef diet. Both blood (prediet and postdiet change) and diets were analyzed for vitamin E, vitamin A, and SE concentrations. Electroejaculates were collected monthly and evaluated for sperm concentration, sperm motility index (includes percent motile and forward progression), and percent NS. Results reveal that the beef and horsemeat diets had comparable (P = 0.05) vitamin E and SE concentrations and all diets met most nutrient requirements for small carnivores; however, the horsemeat diet was excessive in vitamin A and the beef diet was deficient in vitamin A. Vitamin E supplementation increased (chi(2)(1) = 25.83; P < 0.001) serum vitamin E. Ferrets fed the beef diet or prey had improved (H-4 = 15.596; P = 0.004) sperm motility index than the horsemeat control group, and ferrets fed the horsemeat diet supplemented with vitamin E had the lowest (H-4 = 18.408; P = 0.001) NS. In conclusion, the high levels of vitamin A in the horsemeat diet could compete with vitamin E as evidence by serum levels, which may reduce reproductive success in this endangered species.

AB  - Exposure to early-life stress is associated with long-term alterations in brain and behavior, and may aggravate the outcome of neurological insults. This study aimed at investigating the possible interaction between maternal separation, a model of early stress, and subsequent neonatal hypoxia-ischemia on emotional behavior and markers of synaptic plasticity in hippocampus. Therefore, rat pups (N=60) were maternally separated for a prolonged (MS 180min) or a brief (MS 15min) period during the first six postnatal days, while a control group was left undisturbed. Hypoxia-ischemia was applied to a subgroup of each rearing condition on postnatal day 7. Emotional behavior was examined at three months of age and included assessments of anxiety (elevated plus maze), depression-like behavior (forced swimming) and spontaneous exploration (open field). Synaptic plasticity was evaluated based on BDNF and synaptophysin expression in CA3 and dentate gyrus hippocampal regions. We found that neonatal hypoxia-ischemia caused increased levels of anxiety, depression-like behavior and locomotor activity (ambulation). Higher anxiety levels were also seen in maternally separated rats (MS180min) compared to non-maternally separated rats, but prolonged maternal separation prior to HI did not potentiate the HI-associated effect. No differences among the three rearing conditions were found regarding depression like behavior or ambulation. Immunohistochemical evaluation of synaptophysin revealed that both prolonged maternal separation (MS180min) and neonatal hypoxia-ischemia significantly reduced its expression in the CA3 and dentate gyrus. Decreases in synaptophysin expression in these areas were not exacerbated in rats that were maternally separated for a prolonged period prior to HI. Regarding BDNF expression, we found a significant decrease in immunoreactivity only in the hypoxic-ischemic rats that were subjected to the prolonged maternal separation paradigm. The above findings suggest that early-life stress prior to neonatal hypoxia-ischemia leads to significant alterations in synaptic plasticity of the dorsal hippocampus during adulthood, but does not exacerbate HI-related changes in emotional behavior.

AB  - Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin are neuropeptides that are associated with the negative emotional states. Experimental evidence indicates that dynorphin neurons located in the nucleus accumbens and CRF neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) mediate anxiety-like behaviors immediately after the stressful experience (24-48 h). The present study was done to evaluate if changes in the levels of the mRNA for these peptides in the striatum, BST, and CeA were associated with the long-lasting avoidance of novelty, a measure of an anxiety-like state, in a subset of rats exposed to unpredictable and moderately intense footshocks (5 x 2s of 1.5 mA). Shocked rats with enhanced fear to a novel tone 24 h after the footshocks (high responders; HR) displayed long-lasting avoidance in the elevated T-maze whereas shocked rats with low levels of acute fear (low responders; LR) had low levels of avoidance similar to nonshocked rats. An increase in the level of proCRF mRNA was detected in the CeA of the HR compared to LR and nonshocked rats but not in other areas of the brain sampled. In contrast, prodynorphin and proenkephalin mRNA levels in the striatum, BST and CeA were not different between HR, LR and nonshocked rats. This study provides evidence that CRF neurons in the CeA may play a role in the anxiety-like state produced in a subset of rats exposed to footshocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to identify differences in stress measures in pigs (Sus scrofa) with different roles during a tail-biting outbreak. Quartets (n = 16) of age- and gender-matched fattening pigs including a tail biter (TB; n = 16), a victim (V; n = 16), a control in the same pen (C-tb; n = 10), and one in a pen without tail biting (C-no; n = 14) were chosen by direct behavioural observation. Stress measures used were behaviour (dog-sitting, sniffing of pen-mates and aggression), thyroid hormone concentration, morphology of adrenal and thyroid glands and salivary cortisol concentration sampled at 0700, 1000, 1600 and 1900h. Category (TB, V, C-tb, C-no) effects were investigated using a mixed model with replicate as subject and category as repeated effect. Category had a significant effect on adrenal total (cortex + medulla) and cortical area, salivary cortisol at 1900h, serum triiodothyronine (T3) and the behaviours performing and receiving sniffing. Victims suffered from a triad of chronic stress, pathology and suppressed T3 secretion. Evidence for stress in tail biters, a possible cause of the behaviour, consisted of a slightly flattened day-time cortisol pattern and more performed sniffing than all other categories. Differences in evening cortisol concentration and T3 levels between the categories in the pen with ongoing tail biting emphasise the qualities of the control animal. It supports the view that neutral pigs represent a phenotype that adopts a coping strategy leading to lower stress levels than in tail biters and victims, despite being housed in the same pen.

AB  - Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) represents one of the most common causes of neonatal encephalopathy. The central nervous system injury comprises several mechanisms, including inflammatory, excitotoxicity, and redox homeostasis unbalance leading to cell death and cognitive impairment. Exercise during pregnancy is a potential therapeutic tool due to benefits offered to mother and fetus. Swimming during pregnancy elicits a strong metabolic programming in the offspring's brain, evidenced by increased antioxidant enzymes, mitochondrial biogenesis, and neurogenesis. This article aims to evaluate whether the benefits of maternal exercise are able to prevent behavioral brain injury caused by neonatal HI. Female adult Wistar rats swam before and during pregnancy (30 min/day, 5 days/week, 4 weeks). At 7th day after birth, the offspring was submitted to HI protocol and, in adulthood (60th day), it performed the behavioral tests. It was observed an increase in motor activity in the open field test in HI-rats, which was not prevented by maternal exercise. The rats subjected to maternal swimming presented an improved long-term memory in the object recognition task, which was totally reversed by neonatal HI encephalopathy. BDNF brain levels were not altered; suggesting that HI or maternal exercise effects were BDNF-independent. In summary, our data suggest a beneficial long-term effect of maternal swimming, despite not being robust enough to protect from HI injury. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abnormalities in thyroid hormones (TH) availability and/or metabolism have been hypothesized to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to be a risk factor for stroke. Recently, 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), an endogenous amine putatively derived from TH metabolism, gained interest for its ability to promote learning and memory in the mouse. Moreover, T1AM has been demonstrated to rescue the beta-Amyloid dependent LTP impairment in the entorhinal cortex (EC), a brain area crucially involved in learning and memory and early affected during AD. In the present work, we have investigated the effect of T1AM on ischemia-induced EC synaptic dysfunction. In EC brain slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), we demonstrated that the acute perfusion of T1AM (5 mu M) was capable of preventing ischemia-induced synaptic depression and that this protective effect was mediated by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Moreover, we demonstrated that activation of the BDNF-TrkB signalling is required for T1AM action during ischemia. The protective effect of T1AM was more evident when using EC slices from transgenic mutant human APP (mhAPP mice) that are more vulnerable to the effect of OGD. Our results confirm that the TH derivative T1AM can rescue synaptic function after transient ischemia, an effect that was also observed in a A beta-enriched environment.

AB  - It is well established that physical exercise can enhance hippocampal-dependent forms of learning and memory in laboratory animals, commensurate with increases in hippocampal neural plasticity (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] mRNA/protein, neurogenesis, long-term potentiation [LTP]). However, very little is known about the effects of exercise on other, non-spatial forms of learning and memory. In addition, there has been little investigation of the duration of the effects of exercise on behavior or plasticity. Likewise, few studies have compared the effects of exercising during adulthood versus adolescence. This is particularly important since exercise may capitalize on the peak of neural plasticity observed during adolescence, resulting in a different pattern of behavioral and neurobiological effects. The present study addressed these gaps in the literature by comparing the effects of 4 weeks of voluntary exercise (wheel running) during adulthood or adolescence on novel object recognition and BDNF levels in the perirhinal cortex (PER) and hippocampus (HP). Exercising during adulthood improved object recognition memory when rats were tested immediately after 4 weeks of exercise, an effect that was accompanied by increased BDNF levels in PER and HP. When rats were tested again 2 weeks after exercise ended, the effects of exercise on recognition memory and BDNF levels were no longer present. Exercising during adolescence had a very different pattern of effects. First, both exercising and non-exercising rats could discriminate between novel and familiar objects immediately after the exercise regimen ended; furthermore there was no group difference in BDNF levels. Two or four weeks later, however, rats that had previously exercised as adolescents could still discriminate between novel and familiar objects, while non-exercising rats could not. Moreover, the formerly exercising rats exhibited higher levels of BDNF in PER compared to HP, while the reverse was true in the non-exercising rats. These findings reveal a novel interaction between exercise, development, and medial temporal lobe memory systems. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is comorbidity between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and opioid use disorder (OUD), perhaps because PTSD-like stressful experiences early in life alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis to increase the risk for OUD. The present study determined if the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist PT150 reduces the escalation of fentanyl intake in rats exposed to a "two-hit" model of early-life stress (isolation rearing and acute stress). Male and female rats were raised during adolescence in either isolated or social housing and then were given either a single acute stress (restraint and cold-water swim) or control treatment in young adulthood. Rats were then treated daily with PT150 (50 mg/kg, oral) or placebo and were tested for acquisition of fentanyl self-administration in 1-hr sessions, followed by escalation across 6-hr sessions. Regardless of PT150 treatment or sex, acquisition of fentanyl self-administration in 1-hr sessions was greater in isolate-housed rats compared to social-housed rats; the acute stress manipulation did not have an effect on self-administration even though it transiently increased plasma corticosterone levels. During the 6-hr sessions, escalation of fentanyl was observed across all treatment groups; however, there was a significant PT150 Treatment x Sex interaction. While males self-administered more than females overall, PT150 decreased intake in males and increased intake in females, thus negating the sex difference. Although PT150 may serve as an effective treatment for reducing the risk of OUD following early-life stress in males, further work is needed to determine the mechanism underlying the differential effects of PT150 in males and females.
   Public Health Significance The effect of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist PT150 on fentanyl self-administration in male and female rats subjected to early-life stress was examined. Males self-administered more than females, but PT150 eliminated this sex difference, with intake decreasing in males and increasing in females. PT150 may be useful to treat opioid use disorder in males, but not in females.

AB  - Neonatal handling, an experimental model of early life experiences, is known to affect hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis function, thus increasing adaptability, coping with stress, cognitive abilities and in general brain plasticity-related processes. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast synaptic transmission at excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the CNS and are crucial during neuronal development, synaptic plasticity and structural remodeling. AMPARs are composed of four types of subunits, designated as AMPA glutamate receptor subunits (GluA1, GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4), which combine to form tetramers. The present study addressed the question of whether neonatal handling (15 min daily maternal separation from postnatal day 1 (PND1) to PND21) might have an effect on GluA1-4 mRNA levels in adult rat male and female brain using in situ hybridization. We have identified selective sexually dimorphic effects of neonatal handling on the mRNA expression levels of AMPAR subunits in adult rat hippocampus and nuclei of the amygdaloid complex. In the dorsal hippocampus GluA1 mRNA levels were increased in handled males, while they were decreased in handled female animals. In the ventral hippocampus and the amygdaloid complex GluA2 mRNA was lower in handled females, while no effect was observed in handled males. Furthermore, we observed that neonatal handling induced in both sexes decreases of GluA2 mRNA in the dorsal hippocampus, as well as in the somatosensory and occipital cortex, of GluA3 mRNA in most hippocampal areas, amygdaloid complex and cortical regions studied, and of GluA4 mRNA in the ventral hippocampus. These results show that glutamatergic transmission is markedly affected by an early experience. The neonatal handling-induced alterations in AMPAR subunit composition are in line with the increased brain plasticity, the more effective HPA axis function, and in general the more adaptive behavioral phenotype known to characterize the handled animals.

AB  - The revision of EU legislation will ban the use of wild-caught animals in scientific procedures. This change is partially predicated on the assumption that captive-rearing produces animals with reduced fearfulness. Previously, we have shown that hand-reared starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) indeed exhibit reduced fear of humans compared to wild-caught conspecifics. Here, we asked whether this reduction in fear in hand-reared birds is limited to fear of humans or extends more generally to fear of novel environments and novel objects. Comparing 6-8 month old birds hand-reared in the lab with age-matched birds caught from the wild as fledged juveniles a minimum of 1 month previously, we examined the birds' initial reactions in a novel environment (a small cage) and found that wild-caught starlings were faster to initiate movement compared to the hand-reared birds. We interpret this difference as evidence for greater escape motivation in the wild-caught birds. In contrast, we found no differences between hand-reared and wild-caught birds when tested in novel object tests assumed to measure neophobia and exploratory behaviour. Moreover, we found no correlations between individual bird's responses in the different tests, supporting the idea that these measure different traits (e. g. fear and exploration). In summary, our data show that developmental origin affects one measure of response to novelty in young starlings, indicative of a difference in either fear or coping style in a stressful situation. Our data contribute to a growing literature demonstrating effects of earlylife experience on later behaviour in a range of species. However, since we did not find consistent evidence for reduced fearfulness in hand-reared birds, we remain agnostic about the welfare benefits of hand-rearing as a method for sourcing wild birds for behavioural and physiological research.

AB  - Early maternal separation (MS) may produce lasting effects in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) that can change its response to chronic stress in adulthood. Chronic stress affects DH morphology and function, but tianeptine (an anti-depressant) can reverse the stress-induced morphological impairments. Morphologic alterations of hippocampus can affect contextual memory. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of tianeptine in MS and chronically stressed rats on: 1) volume of the DH and its areas using stereology and 2) hippocampal-dependent memory using a fear conditioning test. Male Wistar rats were subjected to daily MS for 4.5 h between postnatal days (PND) 1-21, or to animal facility rearing (AFR). Between (PND) days 50 and 74, rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress and were treated daily with tianeptine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle, providing eight groups: AFR-unstressed/vehicle (n = 5 for stereology, n = 18 for fear conditioning test); AFR unstressed/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10); AFR-chronic stress/vehicle (n = 6 and n = 14); AFR-chronic stress/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10), MS-unstressed/vehicle (n = 5 and n = 19), MS-unstressed/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10), MS-chronic stress/vehicle (n = 6 and n = 18), and MS-chronic stress/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10). MS-chronic stress/tianeptine rats showed a diminished CA1 area than the corresponding MS-unstressed/tianeptine rats. The combination of stressors produced a freezing response similar to those of the control group during postconditioning. During retrieval, MS led to a diminished freezing response compared to the AFR-unstressed groups. Tianeptine had no effect on freezing behavior. Our results show that tianeptine can affect the CA1 area volume differently depending on the nature and quantity of stressors but cannot alter freezing to context.

AB  - Prenatal stress problem, which is considered to be one of the factors promoting development of such diseases as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, epilepsy and others, has recently attracted more attention on behalf of researchers. The studies concerning the prenatal stress impact on behavioral reactions of the posterity are of utmost interest. There are numerous data testifying, that increased anxiety, tendency to depression, difficulty in gaining skills, disturbance of the organism adaptation ability, which in a number of cases is accompanied with decreased vitality and weight, are observed in the animals under the prenatal stress impact. Moreover, the mentioned changes are sex- and age dependent.
   It should be noted, that changes under the prenatal stress impact in sexual behavior of the animals are also observed, which are manifested as sexual cycle dysfunction, preterm delivery in females, whereas in males - as libido suppression and sometimes inclination to the individuals of the same gender. The data showing that the mentioned alterations can also be accompanied with such statical changes as female masculinization and male demasculinisation and feminization are available. The impact of prenatal stress causes changes in nociceptive system as well: pain sensitivity increase, duration and strength of the pain response, as well as pain relief system dysfunction.
   Many scholars explain the changes observed in prenatally stressed animals by the disturbance in the development of different parts of central nervous system, particularly, neurogenesis weakening, decrease in neuron amount, dysfunction of synaptic transmission and synapsis plasticity, as well as changes in the activity of different endocrine systems. The inclusion into pathologic process of hypothalamic-hypophyseal-adrenocortical and other hormonal systems, which are under its control is of great importance.
   The involvement into pathologic process of other biologically important systems (cannabinoid, opioid, serotonin), which have regulatory effect on the different functions of the organism and undergo functional changes under the influence of stress factors action in prenatal period is also significantly important.

AB  - The existence of play, a form of behaviour without obvious benefits to survival or reproduction, is a long-standing ethological mystery. Experiments in which socially deprived juvenile male mammals develop into sexually incompetent adults, along with widespread sexual dimorphism in rough-and-tumble play (R&T), suggest that R&T may prepare juvenile males for adult sexual behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal study of American mink, Neovison vison, on two farms, with two cohorts each. For males (N = 121), we predicted that individuals with the highest frequencies of rough-and-tumble play as juveniles (10-20 weeks old) would, as adults, show shorter latencies to bite females' necks and to begin copulating, and copulate for longer durations. On one farm, we conducted a pilot study of females (N = 10) as a preliminary test of the hypothesis that R&T also prepares females for adult sexual behaviour. Here, our predictions were the opposite of those for males, since abilities to limit the number or duration of copulations could allow females to exercise pre- or postcopulatory mate choice. In total, we observed 1669 maleefemale encounters and 1004 separate copulations. As predicted, frequent juvenile R&T predicted long-lasting copulations in adult males and longer latencies to copulate in adult females. This was true specifically of rough-and-tumble play itself, independently of general activity levels and, among a subset of 32 males reared in environmentally enriched housing, also independently of solitary object play. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that juvenile rough-and-tumble play predicts adult sexual behaviour in any species. Further research is required to test whether our results for females can be replicated, and, importantly, to determine whether play truly has a causal role in either of these correlational relationships.

AB  - The issue of animal welfare, particularly in relation to legislation, involves philosophical, ethical, economic and political issues and is not just a matter for science. A scientific definition of welfare must address the concerns of the public, but is difficult to achieve because of a lack of consensus as to what good welfare involves. The assessment of animal welfare is best achieved using a mixture of design criteria (which specify what must be included in the environment) and performance criteria (which specify what the signs of good welfare are). The quality of stockmanship can have a major influence on animal welfare, and it should not be assumed that the method of housing is the major determinant of animal welfare. The validity of many of the proposed measures of welfare is difficult to determine because of a lack of understanding of the underlying biology. Measures of aversion are the best available measures of animal suffering caused by procedures of short duration, but whether they can be used to assess the effect of housing is uncertain. Consensus has not yet been reached on the issue of behavioral deprivation, but several measures of behavioral motivation can be used to determine if animals are frustrated, although none is free from criticism. Much abnormal, stereotyped behavior seems to reflect feeding rather than housing problems, and there is a lack of firm evidence that the level of stereotypic behavior correlates with the welfare of the animals. The method of housing can influence the animals' physiology, but this effect is not adequately described by measures of corticosteroids. Use of the term ''stress'' generates confusion. Production measures give some information about animal welfare but only if the causes of lowered production are known. Animal welfare is a complex phenomenon and one component of welfare should not be equated with the whole, nor should scientific assessment of welfare be considered a simple matter.

AB  - Background: The chronic stress of social isolation is a valid predictor of cognitive pathology. This study aimed to compare the effects of long-term social isolation on female versus male Wistar rats' learning and memory. We hypothesized that prolonged social isolation stress, which starts early in life, would affect learning in a sex-dependent manner. Methods: Social isolation started at the edge of early to mid-adolescence and lasted 9 months. The rat's cognitive abilities were assessed by habituation and reactivity to novelty in the open field (OF) test, spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM), and the conditioned passive avoidance (PA) reflex. Basal serum corticosterone levels were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Regardless of the housing conditions, females habituated to the OF under low illumination slower than males. Under bright light, the single-housed rats showed hyporeactivity to novelty. In the MWM, all the rats learned to locate the platform; however, on the first training day, the single-housed females' speed was lower relative to other groups. Four months later, in the post-reminder probe trial, the single-housed rats reached the area around the platform site later, and only males, regardless of housing conditions, preferred the target quadrant. Single-housed rats, irrespective of sex, showed a PA deficit. There was a more pronounced conditioned fear in the single-housed males than in females. In both male and female rats, basal corticosterone levels in rat blood serum after 9 months of social isolation did not differ from that in the group-housed rats of the corresponding sex. Meanwhile, females' basal corticosterone level was higher than in males, regardless of the housing conditions. The relative weight of the adrenal glands was increased only in single-housed females. Conclusions: Under long-term social isolation, started early in life, single-housed females compared with males showed more pronounced cognitive impairments in the MWM and PA paradigm, findings that specify their greater vulnerability to the stress of prolonged social isolation.

AB  - Bizarre behaviors (stereotyped stretching, stereotyped rearing, backward movements and jumps) were conspicuously elicited in classical unconditioned, tests with different levels of anxiogenic conditions. They were characterized for the first time as early-BPSD-like symptoms in 6 month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice. The pattern of these behaviors differed from that exhibited by their age- and gender-matched NTg counterparts. Confrontation of an open and illuminated field was the best trigger of such behaviors as compared to mild neophobia in the corner test or the choice between two compartments in the dark-light box. Here we also report that increased freezing, delayed thigmotaxis and enhancement of emotional behaviors were early BPSD-like symptoms indicative of their response to low-stressful environments. Independently of the genotype, consistent gender effects pointed toward the relevance of female gender to study bizarre behaviors and risk assessment. The identification of items of behavior and its gender component were relevant to find out bidirectional and selective behavioral long-lasting effects of postnatal handling. This early life treatment reduced freezing and most of the bizarre behaviors whereas potentiated risk assessment and the horizontal locomotor activity. In contrast, vertical exploratory activity was not modified by the treatment. The results also talk in favor of the beneficence of early-life interventions on the behavioral outcome in adulthood in both healthy and disease conditions. As shown, the consideration of bizarre behaviors and risk assessment may become an additional tool for evaluating BPSD-like symptoms in relation to preventive and/or therapeutical strategies targeted at AD. It may also have a role in the evaluation of the potential risk factors for the disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Of wide interest for health is the relation existing between depression, a very common psychological illness, accompanied by anxiety and reduced ability to concentrate, and adult neurogenesis.
   We will focus on two neurogenic stimuli, fluoxetine and physical exercise, both endowed with the ability to activate adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be required for learning and memory, and both able to counteract depression. Fluoxetine belongs to the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, which represent the most used pharmacological therapy; physical exercise has also been shown to effectively counteract depression symptoms in rodents as well as in humans.
   While there is evidence that the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine requires its pro-neurogenic action, exerted by promoting proliferation, differentiation and survival of progenitor cells of the hippocampus, on the other hand fluoxetine exerts also neurogenesis-independent antidepressant effects by influencing the plasticity of the new neurons generated. Similarly, the antidepressant action of running also correlates with an increase of hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity, although the gene pathways involved are only partially coincident with those of fluoxetine, such as those involved in serotonin metabolism and synapse formation.
   We further discuss how extra-neurogenic actions are also suggested by the fact that, unlike running, fluoxetine is unable to stimulate neurogenesis during aging, but still displays antidepressant effects. Moreover, in specific conditions, fluoxetine or running activate not only progenitor but also stem cells, which normally are not stimulated; this fact reveals how stem cells have a long-term, hidden ability to self-renew and, more generally, that neurogenesis is subject to complex controls that may play a role in depression, such as the type of neurogenic stimulus or the state of the local niche.
   Finally, we discuss how fluoxetine or running are effective in counteracting depression originated from stress or neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - A number of acute or repeated stimuli can induce expression of DeltaFosB (Delta FosB), a transcription factor derived from the fosB gene (an osteosarcoma viral oncogene) via alternative splicing. Delta FosB protein is currently viewed as a 'molecular switch' to repeated stimuli that gradually converts acute responses into relatively stable adaptations underlying long-term neural and behavioral plasticity. Delta FosB has received extensive attention in drug addition, depression, and stress adaptation, but changes in Delta FosB protein expression during pain is not fully understood. In this study we explored Delta FosB expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats experiencing chronic or acute stress-induced pain. Our data reveal that chronic pain induced by neonatal colorectal distension, chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, or maternal separation was associated with an increase in Delta fosB protein expression in mPFC, but acute application of acetic acid or zymosan did not alter the Delta FosB protein expression. Delta FosB expression in the rat visual cortex, a non pain related brain region, did not change in response to (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and acetic acid treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate that Delta FosB protein expression is significantly elevated in rats that have experienced chronic pain and stress, but not acute pain. The Delta FosB protein may serve as an important transcription factor for chronic stress-induced pain. Further research is needed to improve the understanding of both the upstream signaling leading to Delta FosB protein expression as well as the regulation of Delta FosB gene expression in cortical neurons.

AB  - The identification and characterization of variables that influence "liking" and enhance vulnerability to repeated alcohol use are vital to understanding and treating alcohol use disorders. In the current study, we explore the influence of rearing environment and experimenter-administered adolescent ethanol on the hedonic value of ethanol, sucrose, and quinine. Male and female rats were reared for 30 days starting at postnatal day (PND) 21 in either an enriched, isolated, or standard condition and received 1.5 g/kg (intraperitoneally [i.p.]) 20% (w/v) ethanol or saline every other day for 12 days starting at PND 28. Thereafter, all rats had indwelling intraoral fistulae implanted and their taste reactivities to water, ethanol (5, 10, 20, 30, 40% v/v), sucrose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 M), and quinine (0.1, 0.5 mM) were recorded and analyzed. Results indicated that enrichment elevated hedonic responding to sucrose compared to isolation, and induced a stronger negative relationship between hedonic responding and ethanol concentration compared to standard conditions. Enrichment also elevated aversive responding to ethanol and quinine compared to both isolated and standard condition rats. Adolescent ethanol injections marginally reduced aversive responding to quinine. These results replicate previous findings that environmental enrichment enhances both "liking" and aversion. In addition, the current findings suggest that, while adolescent ethanol injections may blunt aversive responses to quinine, they have no effect on aversive or hedonic responding to ethanol or sucrose. Together with existing literature, our results may suggest that experience with the taste of ethanol is necessary for alterations to ethanol "liking" and aversion. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Post-weaning social isolation has been shown to be a relevant animal model for studying the mechanisms underlying psychopathological states induced by early-life stressful experiences. Besides extensively studied brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor, increasing attention is being given to a neuropeptide precursor VGF (non-acronymic). Several lines of evidence indicate an interplay between the neurotrophins and nitric oxide signaling. This study investigated the long-term consequences of post weaning social isolation on behavior, VGF/BDNF/TrkB pathway and two isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the hippocampus and examined whether these effects were sex-specific. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were reared either in social isolation or social groups from postnatal day 21 for 9 weeks (n = 12-15/group and sex). Post-weaning social isolation induced impairments in sensorimotor gating and increased anxiety-like behavior in rats of both sexes. These behavioral alterations were accompanied by attenuated gene expression of VGF and TrkB receptor in the hippocampus. Isolation-induced reduction in VGF gene expression was more evident in male isolates. Similar changes were found in neuronal NOS (nNOS) gene expression with reduced mRNA levels in male isolates. Gene expression of BDNF and inducible NOS was not influenced by isolation rearing or sex. In addition, sex-specific patterns of VGF and nNOS gene expression in the hippocampus with higher mRNA levels in males than in females were revealed. The present study demonstrates a relationship between nNOS, VGF, BDNF, and TrkB confirming a link between nitric oxide and neurotrophins signaling pathways. Our findings indicate that long-term post-weaning social isolation alters signaling via VGF/BDNF/TrkB and nNOS that could interfere with neurodevelopmental processes which may contribute to pathological behavioral symptoms in adulthood. Future studies are needed to support this suggestion since the direct mechanistic link has not been approached in this study.

AB  - The regulation of aggression in captive animals is an important welfare concern. Captive environments typically provide limited space for animals and many species exhibit heightened aggression in response to spatial restriction. However, primates appear to regulate aggression under these conditions. These findings have led to the proposal of three models for responses to spatial density changes: the density-intensity, tension-reduction and conflict-avoidance models. Our study aimed to investigate whether spatial restriction in two groups of captive chimpanzees at the Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa, supported the hypotheses of one or more of these models. In addition, a forth model based on the coping hypothesis of stereotypic behaviour was tested. Behavioural observations of both chimpanzee groups were conducted during the nine month reconstruction of the chimpanzee exhibit, and the associated variation in spatial limitation. Both chimpanzee groups used a tension-reduction tactic to limit aggression in the outdoor environments under high spatial density. In the indoor environments, the one (orphan) group of chimpanzees adopted a tension-reduction tactic to limit aggression while the other (family) group adopted a conflict-avoidance tactic. In both groups, indoor high-density conditions generated significant increases in abnormal behaviour. Our findings provide mixed support for the tension-reduction and conflict-avoidance models, while offering no clear evidence for the density-intensity model. The outcomes suggest that the chimpanzees may also have utilised abnormal behaviour as an outlet for the stress of spatial restriction. Together with evidence from other studies, our results suggest that chimpanzees are flexible in their response to the stress of spatial restriction and may employ aggression-mediation tactics in a context dependent manner. With regard to primate welfare, our findings suggest that aggression during spatial restriction may not necessarily be as prominent a welfare concern as previously thought but redirected and abnormal behaviour may still compromise animal wellbeing under spatial restriction.

AB  - Background: We are interested in the causal interactions between psychological stress and activity within different compartments of the immune system. Psychosocial stress has been reported to not only alter microglia morphology but also produce anxiety-like and depressive-like effects by triggering CNS infiltration of macrophages from the periphery. We sought to test these phenomena in a somewhat different but standardized model of chronic social defeat (SD) stress.
   Methods: We used a paradigm of dyadic home pairing of dominant and subordinate mice that has been validated to induce powerful anxiety-like and depressive-like effects manifested by behavior assessed in social tasks. We administered the SD stress for 3 days (acute SD) or 14 days (chronic SD) and looked for monocyte entry into the brain by three independent means, including CD45 activation states assessed by flow cytometry and tracking fluorescently tagged peripheral cells from Ccr2(wt/rfp) and Ubc(gfp/gfp) reporter mice. We further characterized the effects of SD stress on microglia using quantitative morphometric analysis, ex vivo phagocytosis assays, flow cytometry, and immunochemistry.
   Results: We saw no evidence of stress-induced macrophage entry after acute or chronic defeat stress. In comparison, brain infiltration of peripheral cells did occur after endotoxin administration. Furthermore, mutant mice lacking infiltrating macrophages due to CCR2 knockout developed the same degree of chronic SD-induced depressive behavior as wildtype mice. We therefore focused more closely on the intrinsic immune cells, the microglia. Using Cx3cr1(wt/gpf) microglial reporter mice, we saw by quantitative methods that microglial morphology was not altered by stress at either time point. However, chronic SD mice had elevated numbers of CD68(hi) microglia examined by flow cytometry. CD68 is a marker for phagocytic activity. Indeed, these cells ex vivo showed elevated phagocytosis, confirming the increased activation status of chronic SD microglia. Finally, acute SD but not chronic SD increased microglial proliferation, which occurred selectively in telencephalic stress-related brain areas.
   Conclusions: In the SD paradigm, changes in CNS-resident microglia numbers and activation states might represent the main immunological component of the psychosocial stress-induced depressive state.

AB  - Captive/domestic animals are often described as inactive, with the implicit or explicit implication that this high level of inactivity is a welfare problem. Conversely, not being inactive enough may also indicate or cause poor welfare. In humans, too much inactivity can certainly be associated with either negative or positive affective states. In non-human animals, however, the affective states associated with elevated or suppressed levels of inactivity are still not well understood.
   Part of the complexity is due to the fact that there are many different forms of inactivity, each likely associated with very different affective states. This paper has two aims. One is to identify specific forms of inactivity that can be used as indicators of specific affective states in animals. The other is to identify issues that need to be resolved before we could validly use the remaining, not yet validated forms of inactivity as indicators of affective state.
   We briefly discuss how inactivity is defined and assessed in the literature, and then how inactivity in its various forms relates to affective (either negative or positive) states in animals, basing our reasoning on linguistic reports of affective states collected from humans displaying inactivity phenotypically similar to that displayed by animals in similar situations, and, when possible, on pharmacological validation. Specific forms of inactivity expressed in response to perceived threats (freezing, tonic immobility, and hiding) appear to be, to date, the best-validated indicators of specific affective states in animals. We also identify a number of specific forms of inactivity likely to reflect either negative (associated with ill-heath, boredom-like, and depression-like conditions), or positive states (e.g. 'sun-basking', post-consummatory inactivity), although further research is warranted before we could use those forms as indicators of the affective states. We further discuss the relationship between increased inactivity and affective states by presenting misleading situations likely to yield wrong conclusions. We conclude that more attention should be paid to inactivity in animal welfare studies: specific forms of inactivity identified in this paper are, or have the potential to be, useful indicators of affective (welfare) states in animals.

AB  - Pregnancy is a time of marked neural, physiological and behavioral plasticity in the female and is often a time when women are more vulnerable to stress and stress-related diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Unfortunately the impact of stress during gestation on neurobiological processes of the mother has yet to be fully determined, particularly with regard to changes in the hippocampus; a brain area that plays an important role in stress-related diseases. The present study aimed to determine how stress early in pregnancy may affect hippocampal plasticity in the pregnant female and whether these effects differ from those in virgin females. For this purpose, adult age-matched pregnant and virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two conditions: (1) Control and (2) Stress. Females in the stress condition were restrained during days 5-11 of gestation and at matched time-points in virgin females. All pregnant females received an injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on day 1 of gestation and were sacrificed 21 days later. The same procedure was carried out at matched time points in virgin females. Results show that for number of Ki67-immunoreactive (ir) cells and doublecortin (DCX)-ir cells, there were significant interactions between reproductive state (pregnant/virgin) and stress exposure (p = .05, p = .04, respectively) with control virgin and stressed pregnant females having more Ki67-ir cells than control pregnant females and more DCX-ir cells than stressed virgin females. Results also show that pregnant females had significantly greater glucocorticoid receptor (GR) density in the CA1, CA3 and granule cell layer compared to virgin females. In addition, there was a main effect of stress on GR density in the CA3 region, with stressed females having significantly lower GR density compared to control females (p = .01). This work adds to our understanding of how stress and reproductive state affect plasticity in the female hippocampus. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In free-range and organic production systems, hens can make choices according to their needs and desires, which is in accordance with welfare definitions. Nonetheless, health and behavioral problems are also encountered in these systems. The aim of this article was to identify welfare challenges observed in these production systems in the EU and the most promising solutions to overcome these challenges. It is based on a review of published literature and research projects complemented by interviews with experts. We selected EU specific information for welfare problems, however, the selected literature regarding solutions is global. Free range use may increase the risk of infection by some bacteria, viruses and parasites. Preventive methods include avoiding contamination thanks to biosecurity measures and strengthening animals' natural defenses against these diseases which can be based on nutritional means with new diet components such as insect-derived products, probiotics and prebiotics. Phytotherapy and aromatherapy can be used as preventive and curative medicine and vaccines as alternatives to antibiotics and pesticides. Bone quality in pullets and hens prevents keel deviations and is favored by exercise in the outdoor range. Free range use also lead to higher exposure to variable weather conditions and predators, therefore shadow, fences and guard animals can be used to prevent heat stress and predation respectively. Granting a free range provides opportunities for the expression of many behaviors and yet many hens usually stay close to the house. Providing the birds with trees, shelters or attractive plants can increase range use. Small flock sizes, early experiences of enrichment and personality traits have also been found to enhance range use. Severe feather pecking can occur in free range production systems, although flocks using the outdoor area have better plumage than indoors. While many prevention strategies are facilitated in free range systems, the influence of genetics, prenatal and nutritional factors in free range hens still need to be investigated. This review provides information about practices that have been tested or still need to be explored and this information can be used by stakeholders and researchers to help them evaluate the applicability of these solutions for welfare improvement.

AB  - Mixing gestating sows implies hierarchy formation and has detrimental consequences on welfare. The effects of social stress on the most vulnerable individuals may be underestimated and it is therefore important to evaluate welfare between individuals within groups. This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups. We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order on 20 groups of 46-91 animals. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P = 0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P<0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P = 0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P<0.0001). New sows, especially with a low social status, are more vulnerable throughout gestation and could serve as indicators of non-optimal conditions.

AB  - The costs and benefits of a particular behavioural trait, such as boldness or aggression, may vary depending on the physical environment. We tested whether the common practice of adding physical structure (i.e. boulders) to streams to increase salmonid density has behavioural consequences, as open habitats are predicted to favour individuals that are more bold and aggressive. Wild young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon were captured from habitats of varying physical complexity and placed into semi-natural stream enclosures for 11 days while their behaviour was observed and tested in both open and structurally complex environments. We found evidence for personality, or consistent individual behavioural differences across contexts, for avoidance and site attachment, with repeatabilities of 0.287 and 0.206, respectively, but not for activity or frequency of aggression. Fish were significantly more active and aggressive in the open habitats, and more site-attached in the complex habitats. Active and aggressive fish also grew more in the wild, while site-attached fish grew less in the wild, but more in the enclosures. However, contrary to our expectation, the complexity of the original habitat was not a significant predictor of personality. Our results suggest stream restorations involving increasing habitat complexity will alter the behaviour of young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon, but will not favour any particular personality types.

AB  - Phenol is one typical pollutant in many kinds of industrial wastewater, and some of them frequently existed in saline condition and coexistence with heavy metals. These factors lead to more difficulties of phenol biodegradation. In this study, an efficient phenol-degrading halophilics train SL-1 was isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil and identified as Pseudomonas sp. Strain SL-1 was able to completely degrade up to 800 mg/L phenol less than 40 h but biodegradation was inhibited at higher phenol concentrations. The considerable pH condition for strain SL-1 was slightly acidic condition in a range between 5.0 and 7.0, and the optimal pH value was 7.0. Meanwhile, strain SL-1 was able to biodegrade phenol efficiently in high NaCl concentration up to 20%. Furthermore, strain SL-1 showed a good tolerance of heavy metals. It maintained high phenol removal efficiency in the presence of 10 mM of Zn(II), Cu(II), Mn(II) and Pb (II). In additional, functional genes encoding phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase were present in strain SL-1 as determined. This indicated that phenol biodegraded by strain SL-1 via meta-cleavage pathway. The excellent biodegradation performance showed that strain SL-1 possesses a broad application prospect in phenol bioremediation under complex environmental conditions.

AB  - Canine commercial breeding establishments (CBEs) are kennel facilities where puppies are produced in large numbers for commercial sale. In the popular media, CBEs are commonly referred to as "puppy mills" or "puppy farms." Conditions in CBEs vary widely in quality. Dogs in these facilities are routinely housed for their entire reproductive lives in cages or runs, and provided with minimal to no positive human interaction or other forms of environmental enrichment. Numerous anecdotal reports have suggested that after removal from CBEs many of the former breeding dogs display persistent behavioural and psychological abnormalities when compared with the general pet dog population. The purpose of this study was to determine if this anecdotal evidence could be confirmed empirically.
   Behavioural evaluations of the dogs were obtained from current owners/fosterers using the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), which utilizes ordinal scales to rate either the intensity or frequency of the dog's behaviours. A total of 1169 former CBE dogs were included in the study.
   Among the CBE ex-breeding dogs, 76 different breeds were represented. With the exception of the Bichon Frise (31.5%), all other breeds comprised <5% of the dogs. The sex ratio was 70.3% females and 29.7% males. The dogs had been living in their adoptive homes for an average of 2 years when the C-BARQ was completed.
   When compared with a convenience sample of pet dogs matched for breed, sex, age and neuter status, former CBE breeding dogs were reported as showing significantly higher rates of health problems (23.5% versus 16.6%, P=0.026). With respect to behaviour, CBE dogs displayed significantly higher rates of fear (both social and nonsocial; ordinal GLM models, P<0.001), house-soiling (P<0.001), and compulsive staring (P<0.005); and significantly lower rates of aggression (toward strangers and other dogs; P<0.0001), trainability (P<0.0001), chasing small animals (P<0.0001), excitability (P<0.0001), and energy (P<0.0001).
   By demonstrating that dogs maintained in these environments develop extreme and persistent fears and phobias, possible learning deficits as evidenced by lower trainability, and often show difficulty in coping successfully with normal existence, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that the conditions prevailing in CBEs are injurious to the mental health and welfare of dogs.

AB  - The welfare of agricultural research animals relies not only on measures of good health but also on the presence of positive emotional states and the absence of aversive or unpleasant subjective states such as fear, frustration, or association with pain. Although subjective states are not inherently observable, their interaction with motivational states can be measured through assessment of motivated behavior, which indicates the priority animals place on obtaining or avoiding specific environmental stimuli and thus allows conclusions regarding the impact of housing, husbandry, and experimental procedures on animal welfare. Preference tests and consumer demand models demonstrate that animal choices are particularly valuable when integrated with other behavioral and physiological measurements. Although descriptive assessments of apparently abnormal behavior such as stereotypies and "vacuum behaviors" provide indications of potentially impoverished environments, they should be used with some caution in drawing welfare conclusions. The development of stereotypies may in some cases be linked to psychiatric dysfunction and reflect underlying neurophysiological impairments, which have implications for the ability to perform flexible behavior and thus the quality of research data provided by this kind of behavioral measurement (e.g., in pharmaceutical research). Environmental modifications, commonly termed "enrichment," can have diverse consequences for cognitive function, physiological responses, health, psychological welfare, and research data. Simple practical modifications of housing, husbandry, and experimental design are suggested to improve the psychological welfare of agricultural research animals in accordance with the principles of refining, reducing, and replacing (the "3Rs"), which underlie US Public Health Service Policy, and prevailing public ethics.

AB  - Although the human brain is exceptional in size and information processing capabilities, it is similar to other mammals with regard to the factors that promote its optimal performance. Three such factors are the challenges of physical exercise, food deprivation/fasting, and social/intellectual engagement. Because it evolved, in part, for success in seeking and acquiring food, the brain functions best when the individual is hungry and physically active, as typified by the hungry lion stalking and chasing its prey. Indeed, studies of animal models and human subjects demonstrate robust beneficial effects of regular exercise and intermittent energy restriction/fasting on cognitive function and mood, particularly in the contexts of aging and associated neurodegenerative disorders. Unfortunately, the agricultural revolution and the invention of effort-sparing technologies have resulted in a dramatic reduction or elimination of vigorous exercise and fasting, leaving only intellectual challenges to bolster brain function. In addition to disengaging beneficial adaptive responses in the brain, sedentary overindulgent lifestyles promote obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, all of which may increase the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore important to embrace the reality of the requirements for exercise, intermittent fasting and critical thinking for optimal brain health throughout life, and to recognize the dire consequences for our aging population of failing to implement such brain-healthy lifestyles.

AB  - Enrichment is widely used as tool for managing fearfulness, undesirable behaviors, and stress in captive animals, and for studying exploration and personality. Inconsistencies in previous studies of physiological and behavioral responses to enrichment led us to hypothesize that enrichment and its removal are stressful environmental changes to which the hormone corticosterone and fearfulness, activity, and exploration behaviors ought to be sensitive. We conducted two experiments with a captive population of wild-caught Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) to assess responses to short- (10-d) and long-term (3-mo) enrichment, their removal, and the influence of novelty, within the same animal. Variation in an integrated measure of corticosterone from feathers, combined with video recordings of behaviors, suggests that how individuals perceive enrichment and its removal depends on the duration of exposure. Short- and long-term enrichment elicited different physiological responses, with the former acting as a stressor and birds exhibiting acclimation to the latter. Non-novel enrichment evoked the strongest corticosterone responses of all the treatments, suggesting that the second exposure to the same objects acted as a physiological cue, and that acclimation was overridden by negative past experience. Birds showed weak behavioral responses that were not related to corticosterone. By demonstrating that an integrated measure of glucocorticoid physiology varies significantly with changes to enrichment in the absence of agonistic interactions, our study sheds light on potential mechanisms driving physiological and behavioral responses to environmental change.

AB  - Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) rats, selectively bred for, respectively, rapid vs. extremely poor acquisition of avoidant behaviour in the shuttle-box, display different coping strategies when exposed to aversive environmental conditions: RLA rats are reactive copers and show hyperemotional behaviour characterized by hypomotility and freezing, while RHA rats show a proactive coping behaviour aimed at gaining control over the stressor. RHA rats also display a robust sensation/novelty seeking profile, high baseline levels of impulsivity, and marked preference for, and intake of, natural and drug rewards. This study shows that the Roman lines also differ in sexual behaviour, a main source of natural reward. Thus, male RHA rats engaged in copulatory activity with a receptive female showing more mounts, intromissions and ejaculations in the first copulation test as compared with their RLA counterparts and Sprague Dawley rats used as an external reference strain. Such differences decreased only partially in subsequent copulation tests, with RHA rats always showing higher levels of sexual motivation and performance than RLA rats. Accordingly, analysis of copulatory parameters of five copulation tests performed at 3-day intervals confirmed that the Roman lines display different patterns of copulatory activity that persist after stabilization of copulatory behaviour by sexual experience. Finally, the weight of the testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles increased to a similar extent in both Roman lines after sexual activity.

AB  - Endometriosis is a disorder in which endometrial tissue is found outside the uterus causing pain, infertility and stress. Finding effective, non-hormonal and long-term treatments for endometriosis still remains one of the most significant challenges in the field. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is one of the main signaling peptides within the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis released in response to stress. CRH can affect nervous and visceral tissues such as the uterus and gut via activation of two types of CRH receptors: CRHR1 and CRHR2. Our aim was to determine if blocking CRHR1 with antalarmin will reduce endometriosis progression. In experiment 1 we induced endometriosis in female rats by suturing uterine horn tissue next to the intestinal mesentery and allowed to progress for 7 days. We determined that after 7 days, there was a significant increase in CRHR1 within endometriotic vesicles as compared to normal uterus. In Experiment 2, we induced endometriosis and administered either antalarmin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle during the first 7 days after surgery. A separate group of sham surgery rats served as non-endometriosis controls. Endometriosis was allowed to progress until 60 days after surgery, at which time rats were tested for anxiety behaviors. At the time of sacrifice, endometriotic vesicles, uterus and blood were collected. Treatment with antalarmin significantly reduced the size (67% decrease) and number (30% decrease) of endometriotic vesicles. Antalarmin also prevented the increase in CRH and CRHR1 mRNA within endometriotic vesicles but not of glucocorticoid receptor. Endometriosis did not change anxiety behaviors in the open field and zero-maze tests and prior antalarmin administration did not modify this. Our data provides the first in-vivo demonstration for use of CRHR1 antagonist for the treatment of endometriosis opening the possibility for further exploring CRH signaling as a treatment target for this debilitating disease.

AB  - Both environmental stress and immune challenge can induce abnormal neurobehavior. However, the impact of chronic stress on immune challenge-related neurobehavioral abnormalities is still controversial. Hence, we aimed to investigate the effects of chronic stress on immune challenge-related neurobehavioral abnormalities and explore the possible underlying mechanisms. During the first set of experiments, mice were reared under normal condition (NC) or chronic stress (CS) for 4 consecutive weeks. They were allocated to the following four groups: NC + normal saline (NS) group, CS + NS group, NC + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, and CS + LPS group. Open field, elevated plus maze, fear conditioning, novel object recognition, and forced swimming tests were performed, and their tissues were harvested. During the second set of experiments, after rearing the mice under the above conditions for 3 weeks, microelectrodes were implanted into the CA1 of the hippocampus. After recovery for 1 week under the respective environmental conditions, the mice were allocated to four groups, as in the first experiments. The basal (home cage) and task (fear conditioning)-related local field potential (LFP) were recorded. In the present study, LPS significantly induced a decrease in the freezing to context and discrimination ratio. However, only the freezing to context was further reduced by prior chronic stress. This suggested that chronic stress worsened fear memory impairment induced by acute LPS challenge. Consistent with the change in fear memory, LPS significantly decreased the expression of PV in the CA1, which was further downregulated by prior chronic stress. On the other hand, LPS inhibited the power of both basal and task-related theta oscillations in the CA1. Only the task-related theta power was further decreased by chronic stress. In conclusion, our study showed that the phenotypic loss of PV interneurons and the decrease in the power of the theta oscillation in the CA1 aggravated by chronic stress may mediate, at least in part, the deterioration of fear memory impairment induced by LPS.

AB  - The chronically stressed brain may present a vulnerability to develop maladaptive fear-related behaviors in response to a traumatic event. In rodents, chronic stress leads to amygdala hyperresponsivity and dendritic hypertrophy and produces a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like phenotype that includes exaggerated fear learning following Pavlovian fear conditioning and resistance to extinction. It is unknown whether chronic stress-induced enhanced fear memories are vulnerable to disruption via reconsolidation blockade, as a novel therapeutic approach for attenuating exaggerated fear memories. We used a chronic stress procedure in a rat model (wire mesh restraint for 6 h/d/21 d) to create a vulnerable brain that leads to a PTSD-like phenotype. We then examined freezing behavior during acquisition, reactivation and after post-reactivation rapamycin administration (i.p., 40 mg/kg) in a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm to determine its effects on reconsolidation as well as the subsequent functional activation of limbic structures using zif268 mRNA. Chronic stress increased amygdala zif268 mRNA during fear memory retrieval at reactivation. Moreover, these enhanced fear memories were unaffected by post reactivation rapamycin to disrupt long-term fear memory. Also, post-reactivation long term memory processing was also associated with increased amygdala (LA and BA), and decreased hippocampal CA1 zif268 mRNA expression. These results suggest potential challenges for reconsolidation blockade as an effective approach in treating exaggerated fear memories, as in PTSD. Our findings also support chronic stress manipulations combined with fear conditioning as a useful preclinical approach to study a PTSD-like phenotype. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developing reliable mouse models for social behaviour is challenging. Different tests have been proposed, but most of them consist of rather artificial confrontations of unfamiliar mice in novel arenas or are relying on social stress induced by aggressive conspecifics. Natural social interaction in home cage in laboratory has not been investigated well. IntelliCage is a fully automated home-cage system, where activity of the group-housed mice can be monitored along with various cognitive tasks. Here we report the behavioural profile of C57BL/6N (86) and BALB/c (BALB) female mice in IntelliCage when separated by strain, followed by monitoring of activity and formation of 'home-base' after mixing two strains. For that purpose, 3 cages were connected. Significant differences between the strains were established in baseline behaviour in conventional tests and in IntelliCage. The B6 mice showed reduced anxiety-like behaviour in open field and light-dark box, slightly enhanced exploratory activity in IntelliCage during initial adaptation and clearly distinct circadian activity. Mixing of two strains resulted in reduction of body weight and anhedonia in B6 mice. In addition, the B6 mice showed clear preference to previous home-cage, and formed a new home-base faster than BALB mice. In contrast, BALB mice showed enhanced activity and moving between the cages without showing any preference to previous home-cage. It could be argued that social challenge caused changes in both strains and different coping styles are responsible for behavioural manifestations. Altogether, this approach could be useful in modelling and validating mouse models for disorders with disturbed social behaviour.

AB  - The present study was designed to systematically assess the control experience routinely used in our laboratory as part of studies on predator odour stress. Specifically, we examined effects of the physical and social components of this control experience on measures of anxiety-like behaviour in adolescent rats. Adolescent animals are at increased susceptibility to environmental perturbations and have been used for such studies much less often. Long-Evans rats of both sexes were subjected to physical stimulation (Exposed or Unexposed) and social stimulation (Single-Housed or Pair-Housed), resulting in four groups. Exposed rats received six 30-min exposures to an enclosed arena containing an unscented piece of cat collar occurring between adolescence and early adulthood, while Unexposed remained in the home cage. Groups of Exposed and Unexposed animals were housed singly (Single-Housed) from early adolescence to early adulthood or Pair-Housed during this time. Experimental procedures began in adolescence and involved repeated assessment of startle amplitude (measure of anxiety-like behaviour) and prepulse inhibition (PPI; a measure of sensorimotor gating) to gauge the shortterm impact of social and/or physical stimulation. All animals were re-paired in adulthood prior to a final startle/PPI session to assess if isolation limited to adolescence could impose long-term effects that were not reversible. We also measured anxiety-like behaviour in adulthood using an extended open field test (EOFT; addition of novel objects to the open field on later days), and the elevated plus maze task (EPM), as well as a sucrose preference test (SPT) to measure anhedonia. An absence of social or physical stimulation resulted in increased startle amplitude and some measures of anxiety-like behaviour in the EOFT, but a reduction in such anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM task. These results suggest common neural substrates for the physical and social experiences. Performance in the SPT was unaltered by any experimental treatments. Sensorimotor gating, as measured by PPI, was increased in the absence of physical stimulation with no short-term effect of isolation, or of re-pairing. These results indicate the importance of considering individual components of the rearing environment of rats, while showing the need to use multiple assays of anxiety-like behaviour.

AB  - The field of behavioral neuroendocrinology has generated thousands of studies that indicate differences in brain structure and reactivity to gonadal steroids that produce sex-specific patterns of social behavior. However, rapidly emerging evidence shows that genetic polymorphisms and resulting differences in the expression of neuroactive peptides and receptors as well as early-life experience and epigenetic changes are important modifiers of social behavior. Furthermore, due to its inherent complexity, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying sex differences in social behavior are usually studied in a tightly regulated laboratory setting rather than in complex environments. Importantly, specific hormones may elicit a range of different behaviors depending on the cues present in these environments. For example, individuals exposed to a psychosocial stressor may respond differently to the effects of a gonadal steroid than those not exposed to chronic stress. The objective of this review is not to re-examine the activational effects of hormones on sex differences in social behavior but rather to consider how genetic and environmental factors modify the effects of hormones on behavior. We will focus on estrogen and its receptors but consideration is also given to the role of androgens. Furthermore, we have limited our discussions to the importance of oxytocin and vasopressin as targets of gonadal steroids and how these effects are modified by genetic and experiential situations. Taken together. the data clearly underscore the need to expand research initiatives to consider gene-environment interactions for better understanding of the neurobiology of sex differences in social behavior.

AB  - Early experience has a profound influence on brain development, and the modulation of prenatal perceptual learning by external environmental stimuli has been shown in birds, rodents and mammals. In the present study, the effect of prenatal complex rhythmic music sound stimulation on post natal spatial learning, memory and isolation stress was observed. Auditory stimulation with either music or species-specific sounds or no stimulation (control) was provided to separate sets of fertilized eggs from day 10 of incubation. Following hatching, the chicks at age 24, 72 and 120 h were tested on a T-maze for spatial learning and the memory of the learnt task was assessed 24 h after training. In the post-hatch chicks at all ages, the plasma corticosterone levels were estimated following 10 min of isolation. The chicks of all ages in the three groups took less (p < 0.001) time to navigate the maze over the three trials thereby showing an improvement with training. In both sound-stimulated groups, the total time taken to reach the target decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in comparison to the unstimulated control group, indicating the facilitation of spatial learning. However, this decline was more at 24 h than at later posthatch ages. When tested for memory after 24 h of training, only the music-stimulated chicks at posthatch age 24 h took a significantly longer (p < 0.001) time to traverse the maze, suggesting a temporary impairment in their retention of the learnt task. In both sound-stimulated groups at 24 h, the plasma corticosterone levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) and increased thereafter at 72 h (p ! 0.001) and 120 h which may contribute to the differential response in spatial learning. Thus, prenatal auditory stimulation with either species-specific or complex rhythmic music sounds facilitates spatial learning, though the music stimulation transiently impairs postnatal memory.

AB  - Current climate change is leading to increasingly unpredictable environmental conditions and is imposing new challenges to wildlife. For example, ambient conditions fluctuating during critical developmental periods could potentially impair the development of cognitive systems and may therefore have a long-term influence on an individual's life. We studied the impact of temperature variability on zebra finch cognition, focusing on song learning and song quality (N = 76 males). We used a 2 x 2 factorial experiment with two temperature conditions (stable and variable). Half of the juveniles were cross-fostered at hatching to create a mismatch between pre- and posthatching conditions, the latter matching this species' critical period for song learning. We found that temperature variability did not affect repertoire size, syllable consistency, or the proportion of syllables copied from a tutor. However, birds that experienced variable temperatures in their posthatching environment were more likely to sing during recordings. In addition, birds that experienced variable prenatal conditions had higher learning accuracy than birds in stable prenatal environments. These findings are the first documented evidence that variable ambient temperatures can influence song learning in zebra finches. Moreover, they indicate that temperature variability can act as a form of environmental enrichment with net positive effects on cognition.
   Climate change and environmental unpredictability can affect cognitive development and subsequent cognitive performance in animals. This effect could be even more severe when learning of a crucial skill occurs within a definite period of time during development. In this study, we show that temperature variability actually enhances song learning accuracy in zebra finches and does not impact other key song parameters, such as the repertoire size or the proportion of syllables copied from the tutor.

AB  - Repeated exposure to laboratory stressors often results in behavioral changes that are commonly referred to as depressive-like behaviors. Here, we examined the contribution fear conditioning may play in altering an animals' behavior in a repeated stress paradigm. Fischer rats were exposed daily to different stressors in a complex environment (context A). After four days of stressor exposure, exploratory behavior (10 min in new cage) and social interaction (5 min with juvenile) were tested on day 5 in either the same environment or a new environment (context B). Rats showed decreased exploration and social interaction when tested in context A compared to control rats or rats tested in context B. Additionally, chronic infusion of propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier), but not nadolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier), prevented the behavioral changes following repeated stressor exposure. Propranolol treatment did not affect the acute or chronic elevation of corticosterone, the decrease in body weight gain, or adrenal hypertrophy observed in animals exposed to stress. These data demonstrate that conditioned fear responses can contribute to behavioral changes in a repeated stress paradigm. Additional studies revealed, Sprague-Dawley rats do not demonstrate decreased exploration or social interaction when testing occurs in the same context as repeated stressor exposure suggesting Fischer rats may have a greater propensity to associate distal cues with aversive events in a complex environment. This may be due to greater stress responses in Fischer animals that are known to enhance consolidation of emotionally arousing events. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animal models of schizophrenia-relevant symptoms are increasingly important for progress in our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the disorder and for discovering novel and more specific treatments. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and working memory, which are impaired in schizophrenic patients, are among the symptoms/processes modeled in those animal analogs. We have evaluated whether a genetically-selected rat model, the Roman high-avoidance inbred strain (RHA-I), displays PPI deficits as compared with its Roman low-avoidance (RLA-I) counterpart and the genetically heterogeneous NIH-HS rat stock. We have investigated whether PPI deficits predict spatial working memory impairments (in the Morris water maze; MWM) in these three rat types (Experiment 1), as well as in a separate sample of NIH-HS rats stratified according to their extreme (High, Medium, Low) PPI scores (Experiment 2). The results from Experiment 1 show that RHA-I rats display PPI and spatial working memory deficits compared to both RLA-I and NIH-HS rats. Likewise, in Experiment 2, "Low-PPI" NIH-HS rats present significantly impaired working memory with respect to "Medium-PPI" and "High-PPI" NIH-HS subgroups. Further support to these results comes from correlational, factorial, and multiple regression analyses, which reveal that PPI is positively associated with spatial working memory performance. Conversely, cued learning in the MWM was not associated with PPI. Thus, using genetically-selected and genetically heterogeneous rats, the present study shows, for the first time, that PPI is a positive predictor of performance in a spatial working memory task. These results may have translational value for schizophrenia symptom research in humans, as they suggest that either by psychogenetic selection or by focusing on extreme PPI scores from a genetically heterogeneous rat stock, it is possible to detect a useful (perhaps "at risk") phenotype to study cognitive anomalies linked to schizophrenia.

AB  - Metazoan adaptation to global change relies on selection of standing genetic variation. Determining the extent to which this variation exists in natural populations, particularly for responses to simultaneous stressors, is essential to make accurate predictions for persistence in future conditions. Here, we identified the genetic variation enabling the copepod Acartia tonsa to adapt to experimental ocean warming, acidification, and combined ocean warming and acidification (OWA) over 25 generations of continual selection. Replicate populations showed a consistent polygenic response to each condition, targeting an array of adaptive mechanisms including cellular homeostasis, development, and stress response. We used a genome-wide covariance approach to partition the allelic changes into three categories: selection, drift and replicate-specific selection, and laboratory adaptation responses. The majority of allele frequency change in warming (57%) and OWA (63%) was driven by shared selection pressures across replicates, but this effect was weaker under acidification alone (20%). OWA and warming shared 37% of their response to selection but OWA and acidification shared just 1%, indicating that warming is the dominant driver of selection in OWA. Despite the dominance of warming, the interaction with acidification was still critical as the OWA selection response was highly synergistic with 47% of the allelic selection response unique from either individual treatment. These results disentangle how genomic targets of selection differ between single and multiple stressors and demonstrate the complexity that nonadditive multiple stressors will contribute to predictions of adaptation to complex environmental shifts caused by global change.

AB  - This study explores the long-term effects of exposure to a maternal Western diet (WD) vs. standard diet (SD) in the Yucatan minipig, on the adult progeny at lean status (n = 32), and then overweight status. We investigated eating behavior, cognitive abilities, brain basal glucose metabolism, dopamine transporter availability, microbiota activity, blood lipids, and glucose tolerance. Although both groups demonstrated similar cognitive abilities in a holeboard test, WD pigs expressed a higher stress level than did SD pigs (immobility, P < 0.05) and lower performance in an alley maze (P = 0.06). WD pigs demonstrated lower dopamine transporter binding potential in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (P < 0.05 for both), as well as a trend in putamen (P = 0.07), associated with lower basal brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (P < 0.05) compared with lean SD pigs. Lean WD pigs demonstrated a lower glucose tolerance than did SD animals (higher glucose peak, P < 0.05) and a tendency to a higher incremental area under the curve of insulin from 0 to 30 minutes after intravenous glucose injection (P < 0.1). Both groups developed glucose intolerance with overweight, but WD animals were less impacted than SD animals. These results demonstrate that maternal diet shaped the offspring's brain functions and cognitive responses long term, even after being fed a balanced diet from weaning, but behavioral effects were only revealed in WD pigs under anxiogenic situation; however, WD animals seemed to cope better with the obesogenic diet from a metabolic standpoint.Gautier, Y., Luneau, I., Coquery, N., Meurice, P., Malbert, C.-H., Guerin, S., Kemp, B., Bolhuis, J.

AB  - Animals in a negative affective state seem to be more sensitive to reward loss, i.e. an unexpected decrease in reward size. The aim of this study was to investigate whether early-life and current enriched vs. barren housing conditions affect the sensitivity to reward loss in pigs using a successive negative contrast test. Pigs (n = 64 from 32 pens) were housed in barren or enriched conditions from birth onwards, and at 7 weeks of age experienced either a switch in housing conditions (from barren to enriched or vice versa) or not. Allotting pigs to the different treatments was balanced for coping style (proactive vs. reactive). One pig per pen was trained to run for a large reward and one for a small reward. Reward loss was introduced for pigs receiving the large reward after 11 days (reward downshift), i.e. from then onwards, they received the small reward. Pigs housed in barren conditions throughout life generally had a lower probability and higher latency to get the reward than other pigs. Proactive pigs ran overall slower than reactive pigs. After the reward downshift, all pigs ran slower. Nevertheless, reward downshift increased the latency and reduced the probability to get to the reward, but only in pigs exposed to barren conditions in early life, which thus were more sensitive to reward loss than pigs from enriched early life housing. In conclusion, barren housed pigs seemed overall less motivated for the reward, and early life housing conditions had long-term effects on the sensitivity to reward loss.

AB  - In juvenile and young adult mice monocular deprivation (MD) shifts the ocular dominance (OD) of binocular neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) away from the deprived eye. However, OD plasticity is completely absent in mice older than 110 days, but can be reactivated by treatments which decrease GABA levels in V1. Typically, these OD shifts can be prevented by increasing GABAergic transmission with diazepam. We could recently demonstrate that both bilateral whisker and auditory deprivation (WD, AD), can also restore OD plasticity in mice older than 110 days, since MD for 7 days in WD mice caused a potentiation of V1 input through the ipsilateral (open) eye, the characteristic feature of OD plasticity of "young adult" mice. Here we examined whether WD for 7 days also decreases GABA levels. For this, we performed post mortem HPLC analysis of V1 tissue. Indeed, we found that WD significantly decreased GABA levels in V1. Surprisingly, enhancing GABAergic inhibition by diazepam did not abolish OD shifts in WD mice, as revealed by repeated intrinsic signal imaging. On the contrary, this treatment led to a depression of V1 input through the previously closed contralateral eye, the characteristic signature of OD plasticity in juvenile mice during the critical period. Interestingly, the same result was obtained after AD. Taken together, these results suggest that cross-modally restored OD plasticity does not only depend on reduction of GABA levels in V1, but also requires other, so far unknown mechanisms.

AB  - The selective breeding of Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) rats for rapid vs extremely poor acquisition of active avoidance behavior in a shuttle-box has generated two phenotypes with different emotional and motivational profiles. The phenotypic traits of the Roman rat lines/strains (outbred or inbred, respectively) include differences in sensation/novelty seeking, anxiety/fearfulness, stress responsivity, and susceptibility to addictive substances. We designed this study to characterize differences between the inbred RHA-I and RLA-I strains in the impulsivity trait by evaluating different aspects of the multifaceted nature of impulsive behaviors using two different models of impulsivity, the delay-discounting task and five-choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task. Previously, rats were evaluated on a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) task that has been suggested as a model of obsessive-compulsive disorder. RHA-I rats showed an increased acquisition of the SIP task, higher choice impulsivity in the delay-discounting task, and poor inhibitory control as shown by increased premature responses in the 5-CSRT task. Therefore, RHA-I rats manifested an increased impulsivity phenotype compared with RLA-I rats. Moreover, these differences in impulsivity were associated with basal neurochemical differences in striatum and nucleus accumbens monoamines found between the two strains. These findings characterize the Roman rat strains as a valid model for studying the different aspects of impulsive behavior and for analyzing the mechanisms involved in individual predisposition to impulsivity and its related psychopathologies.

AB  - New neuron formation in the adult brain extends our knowledge and incorporates a novel dimension about brain plasticity. Adult neurogenesis is a complex process regulated by different factors within the niche, where adult neural stem cells reside, proliferate and differentiate. Neural stem cell together with astrocytes and endothelial cells form the principle components of this complex niche. Other molecular factors that regulate adult neurogenesis are the neuro-transmitters (GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine); hormones (prolactin, growth hormone, estrogens and melatonin); growth factors (FGF, EGF, VEGF) and neurotrophins (BDNF, NT3). All of them regulate different aspects of the neurogenic process.
   Behavioral regulators that influence new neuron formation in the adult brain include physical activity, complex stimulatory environment best known as enrichment environment, and social interaction. Voluntary physical activity with free access to the running wheel increases the number of proliferating cells, while the complex stimulotory environment provided by enriched environment preferentially influences survival of newborn cells. In addition, social interaction has a positive influence on the new neuron formation in the dentate gyrus (DG).
   Although adult hippocampal neurogenesis is positively regulated by the aforementioned factors, there are different conditions with negative influence on this process. Some of these conditions are stress exposure and sleep deprivation. Both conditions are present in neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Thus, stress and sleep deprivation impair adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
   Alteration of the neurogenic process following stress occurs due to the high levels of glucocorticoid receptors within the hippocampus and because exposure to stress causes the increase in glucocorticoid levels.
   Preclinical studies have shown that exposure to different classes of stressors affect hippocompal neurogenesis. Prolonged exposure to stressors (chronic mild stress), predatory odor, foot shock, acute force swimming and psychosocial stress not only affect mature neuronal plasticity but also hippocampal neurogenesis.
   Although there is information about the effects of stress on adult neurogenesis, the mechanism by which stress causes inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis remains unclear. Recent work showed that exposure to stress increases the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in several brain areas. Also, administration of IL-1 beta exerts stress-like effects including down-regulation of hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Additionally, inhibition of the receptor for IL-1 beta prevents stress-like effects. Moreover, the suppression of cell proliferation is mediated by direct actions of IL-1 beta) on IL-1RI receptors localized on precursor cells. These findings support that IL-1 beta is a critical mediator of the antineurbgenic effect caused by acute and chronic stress. However, IL-1 beta is not the unique mediator of stress that could be involved in the alteration of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Recently it was reported that the decrease in cell proliferation concomitantly occurs with an increase of IL6 and TNF alpha levels.
   Preclinical studies have suggested that adult hippocbmpal neurogenesis is not a sole cause of depression or the sole mechanism of treatment efficacy, but it is likely an important contributor to this complex disorder. In order to revert the effects of stress on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, different therapies have been used, for example: electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), exercise, complex stimulatory environment and antidepressant drugs.
   Although the most rapid induction of neurogenesis is seen with ECT application, most studies have been done with antidepressant drugs. The effects of antidepressants are time-dependent as highest therapeutic effects ore observed within the time course of weeks.
   Different types of antidepressants (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and atypical antidepressants) have been used to study their influence Ion the neurogenic process. Despite that serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most prescribed treatments for major depression and that the therapeutic effects of antidepressants require chronic treatment, the mechanisms by which these drugs exert their effects on hippocampal neurogenesis are still unknown. Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors are very fast in increasing serotonin levels, the antidepressani action is delayed possibly because of the induction of structural or functional changes that possibly need longer time (2-4 weeks).
   In this regard, one of the actions of antidepressants is the regulation of adult hippocampal neuregenesis, a process that is consistent with the delayed onset of therapeutic effects of antidepressants. Fluoxetine is one of the antidepressants more used to study its influence on adult neurogenesis. Fluoxetine targets amplifying neural progenitors by increasing the rate of symmetric divisions without altering the division of stem-like cells in the DG. Considering previous classification based on the temporal protein markers expression, the neural progenitors targeted by fluoxetine correspond to type 2a, 2b and type 3.
   In addition, the increase in new neurons caused by fluoxetine is due to the expansion of neural progenitors. In addition to cell proliferation, the neurogenic process also involves a maturation step, Which is associated with the expression of doublecortin, a protein that binds to microtubules and that is expressed along the cytoplasm. of the cell. Further maturation of immature neurons such as. dendrite maturation, is controlled independently of the regulation of precursor cell proliferation. Thus, micro-regulatory events influence the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, fluoxetine also affects dendrite maturation and functional integration of new neurons. Chronic fluoxetine treatment modifies dendrite morphology increasing dendrite arborisation and favors synaptic plasticity-of newborn granule cells. Also, chronic administration of fluoxetine causes behavioral improvement, an effect that was blocked when neurogenesis was ablated by X-ray irradiation.
   Other important factor that influences the effect of antidepressants on adult neurogenesis is the genetic background. Then antidepressants' induced behavioral improvement depending on the genetic background of the mouse strain used.
   Preclinical studies in mice have revealed different actions of antidepresants on-adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, studies in humans, are scarce and deserve greater attention to discover the correlation between preclinical and Clinical studies. Recent work in human brains shows contradictory evidences about the regulation of neuronal development by antidepressants. These evidences are in the same line as recent published work in which it was demonstrated that the effects of ADs are age-dependent.
   Altogether, multiple evidences indicate that antidepressants affect several aspects of the neurogenic process. Therefore, chronic treatment is necessary for the antidepressant-dependent regulation of adult hippocampal neuregenesis. In addition, it has been shown that antidepressants act through different pathways involving both neurogenesis-dependent and neurogenesis-independent actions.
   Although there is an important increase in the adult hippocampal neurogenesis field, it is necessary to increase the number of studies performed in human beings to correlate the preclinical findings with clinical studies to address the role of adult neurogenesis in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Reptiles are popular pets around the world, although their welfare requirements in captivity are not always met, due in part to an apparent lack of awareness of their needs. Herein, we searched a selection of the scientific literature for evidence of, and explorations into, reptile sentience. We used these findings to highlight: (1) how reptiles are recognised as being capable of a range of feelings; (2) what implications this has for the pet trade; and (3) what future research is needed to help maximise their captive welfare. We found 37 studies that assumed reptiles to be capable of the following emotions and states; anxiety, stress, distress, excitement, fear, frustration, pain, and suffering. We also found four articles that explored and found evidence for the capacity of reptiles to feel pleasure, emotion, and anxiety. These findings have direct implications for how reptiles are treated in captivity, as a better understanding of their sentience is critical in providing them with the best quality of life possible.
   We searched a selection of the scientific literature to document evidence for, and explorations into reptile sentience. The intention of this review was to highlight; (1) to what extent reptile capability for emotions have been documented in the scientific literature; (2) to discuss the implications this evidence has for the trade in reptiles; and (3) to outline what future research is needed to maximise their captive welfare needs. We used 168 keywords associated with sentience, to search through four journal databases and one open-access journal. We recorded studies that explored sentience in reptiles and those that recognised reptile sentience in their experiments. We found that reptiles were assumed to be capable of the following emotions and states; anxiety, distress, excitement, fear, frustration, pain, stress, and suffering, in 37 articles. We also found four articles that explored and found evidence for the capacity of reptiles to feel pleasure, emotion, and anxiety. These findings show that reptiles are considered to be capable of experiencing a range of emotions and states. This has implications for how reptiles are treated in captivity, as a better understanding could help to inform a range of different operational initiatives aimed at reducing negative animal welfare impacts, including improved husbandry and consumer behaviour change programmes.

AB  - Surveillance of cat shelters by official veterinarians in Austria is based on legal requirements and does not directly assess cat welfare. The aim of this study was to develop animal-based parameters that are feasible to measure in a surveillance setting, stable over time, and reproducible by different raters. We assessed physical condition (body condition, eye and nose discharge, and coat and skin) and behavior of the cats (aggressive interactions, play behavior, behavior toward humans) and also collected data about housing conditions, shelter management, and the shelter cat population. The validity of the animal-based parameters was assessed by examining relationships with housing conditions. Thirty animal shelters housing a median of 63 cats each were studied. Cats were kept mostly in groups (mean size, 7). Adult cats housed in the shelter for at least 4 weeks (24 +/- 18 per shelter) were included. Test-retest reliability of the animal-based parameters was assessed by visiting 10 shelters twice approximately 2 months apart. To assess interrater reliability (IRR), 36 pens were evaluated by 2 raters. Two parameters were stable over time with acceptable IRR. The proportion of very thin cats (body condition score of 1/5) and the proportion of cats with a poor coat condition correlated highly with no significant difference between visits (%catsverythin: r(s) = 0.84, P = 0.002, Wilcoxon test: P = 0.225; % catspoorcoat: r(s) = 0.86, P = 0.002, Wilcoxon test: P = 0.128). IRR was moderate for % catsverythin (r(s) = 0.63, P < 0.001) and good for % catspoorcoat (r(s) = 0.87, P < 0.001). The physical condition of the cats was found to correlate with housing conditions; for example, an increased proportion of very thin cats correlated with a higher proportion of pens with less than 1 lying area per cat (r(s) = 0.54, P < 0.05) and with a lower proportion of pens with hiding places for all cats (r(s) = -0.54, P < 0.05). Poorer scores for coat condition correlated with longer mean length of stay in the shelter (r(s) = 0.46, P < 0.05), fewer cat toilets per cat (r(s) = -0.37, P < 0.05), and a more unpleasant odor (r(s) = 0.57, P < 0.05). Our results show that simple animal-based parameters can give an indication of how well cats cope with their environment and suggest that the use of these parameters, in addition to the assessment of conformance with legal requirements for shelter surveillance, could be beneficial for cat welfare.

AB  - An enriched environment is widely used to improve domestic animals' welfare and promote their natural behaviors. Music can reduce abnormal behavior in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. However, little is known about the effects of music on pigs. This study aims to explore the effects of repeated music stimulation on the behavior, physiology, and immunity of growing pigs. A total of 72 hybrid piglets (Large White x Duroc x Minpig) were randomly divided into three groups, including music (Mozart K.448, 60 to 70 dB), noise (recorded mechanical noise, 80 to 85 dB), and control (natural background sound, <40 dB), and 6 h sound stimulation was given per day (1000 to 1600 hours) from 40 to 100 d of age. The behavioral activities of the pigs were observed during the music stimulation, and their serum cortisol, salivary cortisol, and serum immune indices were also measured. Compared with the control group, the music group and noise group increased activity but decreased lying of pigs (P < 0.05). A significant increase in tail-wagging, playing, and exploring behaviors of pigs was found in the music group (P < 0.05), and the noise significantly increased the aggressive behavior of the pigs (P < 0.05). Tail-wagging, playing, exploring, manipulating, and aggressive behaviors decreased over time. Short-term (8 d) music stimulus had a lower cortisol level than that of the noise and control groups (P < 0.05), whereas long-term (60 d) music stimulus increased immunoglobulin G (IgG), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels (P < 0.05) and decreased interleukin-4 (IL-4) level (P < 0.05). Long-term noise stimulus significantly reduced the level of IgG (P < 0.05) but did not affect the level of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-. levels (P > 0.05). In conclusion, short-term music stimulus (8 d) reduced the stress response, whereas long-term music stimulus (60 d) enhanced the immune responses. In addition, the noise increased the aggressive behavior, and long-term noise reduced the immunity of the growing pigs.

AB  - Early socialization not only facilitates positive behaviors and cognition abilities of post-weaning piglets, but also has effects on social behavior and physiology of suckling piglets during the lactation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of early socialization environment on social behavior, stress coping and weaning weight of suckling piglets. We selected 199 piglets (Large White x Duroc x Min pig) from 18 litters and three treatments were differentiated: intermittent contact group (IC, 6 litters), piglets of two neighboring litters were socialized twice a week for 3 h from D14 (14 days of age) to D35; continuous contact group (CC, 6 litters), piglets of two neighboring litters were socialized continuously from D14 to D35; the control group (CON, 6 litters), piglets were not socialized during the lactation. Behavioral observation occurred on D14, D15, D21, D22, D28, D29, D33 and D34, and blood samples were collected on D16, D28 and D34. The results revealed that the amount of fighting and head knocking in IC group was higher than CC and CON groups (P < 0.05). On the social interaction during the lactation, for performing piglet, piglets in CC group showed more oral-nasal contact than IC in 3 weeks of age (W-3 , D21 and D22) (P = 0.045), and socialized groups (CC, IC) showed more oral-nasal contact than CON in W-4 (P = 0.001). The amount of mounting in CC was higher than IC and CON from W-3 to W-5 (P < 0.001). For receiving pig, amounts of avoiding behavior in IC and CC were higher than CON in W 4 (P = 0.047). The return approach (positive response to the performing pig) of IC and CC were higher than C in W-2, CC was higher than IC and CON in W-3 (P = 0.003), socialized groups were higher than CON in W-4 and W-5 (P < 0.001). Serum epinephrine concentration in IC and CC were lower than CON on D16 (P < 0.001). The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration of IC was higher than CC and CON (P < 0.05) on D16 and D28, IC and CC were higher than CON (P = 0.004) on D34. There was no significant difference in weaning weight and crosssucking frequency among treatments. In conclusion, the early socialization environment provided opportunities for piglets to improve their social skills, increased the expression of social behaviors and had a positive impact on the expression of BDNF in piglets.

AB  - Objective: Emotional empathy is critical to successful social interactions and is often compromised after traumatic brain injury (FBI). Using the Emostroop task, we investigated whether adults with moderate to severe TBI (N = 26) have problems with rapid conceptual processing of emotional stimuli compared with controls (N = 30). Further, we investigated whether rapid conceptual processing of emotions relates to emotion recognition and emotional empathy. Method: In the Emostroop task, participants categorize emotional words (e.g., joyous, furious, and woeful) into three emotion categories: happy. sad, and angry. Each word is superimposed onto an image of a face, which expresses an emotion that is congruent to the word (congruent condition), incongruent to the word (incongruent condition), or is neutral (neutral condition). Slowed responding in the incongruent condition (interference) and speeded responding in the congruent condition (facilitation) indicates rapid conceptual processing of the faces. Participants also completed an emotion perception task, an empathy questionnaire (the BEES) and neuropsychological tests measuring processing speed. working memory. and executive function. Results: Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that rapid conceptual processing of emotional faces was preserved in people with TBI, despite diminished neuropsychological performance, emotion recognition, emotional empathy, and slowed responding. Further, the Emostroop effect was not correlated with self-reported emotional empathy or with emotion recognition. Conclusions: We conclude that in people with TBI, reduced empathy may be explained by processes downstream of the initial rapid conceptual processing of emotional information, such as flexibly attending and responding to this information in a goal-directed manner in complex environments.

AB  - Handling of laboratory rats can increase physiological and emotional stress, leading to a fearful relationship with humans. We hypothesized that the affective quality of handling techniques used during routine care influences the animals' fear of humans. We assessed responses of male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 32) to four handling treatments provided by caretakers from 57 to 74 days of age: (1) Minimal handling once weekly during cage cleaning (this handling was common to all treatments); (2) Exposed to a Passive hand for 2 min daily; (3) Tickled for 2 min daily, mimicking social play; (4) Restrained on back for 2 min daily, intended to mimic unreciprocated pinning by a dominant rat. Behaviour was assessed on days 77-87 during a Human Approach test of attraction to a human hand (HA; 2 min without hand, followed by 3 min with a familiar or unfamiliar passive hand), Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) and Cat Odour (CAT) tests of anxiety, and weighing and injection procedures (to assess ease of handling). In the HA test, Tickled rats reared (interpreted as non-fearful monitoring behaviour) more often than Restrained rats prior to hand presentation (P < 0.05). In the presence of the hand, Tickled rats reared more often, and made more hand contacts than Minimally-handled rats, and uttered more 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (interpreted as indicating positive affect) than rats from the Passive treatment. Both Tickled and Restrained rats spent more time near the hand than Minimally-handled rats (P < 0.05). Although rats from all treatments directed more behaviour towards a familiar hand, Tickled rats visited an unfamiliar hand more often than Minimally-handled rats (P < 0.05). The handling treatments did not affect ease of handling during weighing, or behaviour in the EPM or CAT tests. During the minute after receiving an intra-peritoneal injection, rats from the Tickled and Passive treatments spent more time rearing close to the experimenter than rats from the Minimally-handled and Restraint treatments (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, rats (N = 16) were tickled by one handler, and restrained by another. for 2 min daily over 15 days. When preference for the two handlers was compared, rats spent similar time near, and in contact with, both handlers, but nibbled their tickler's hand (interpreted as play solicitation) more often than the hand of their restraint handler (P < 0.05). The results from both experiments indicate that, unexpectedly, the Restraint treatment was not aversive to the rats. Both the Passive and Restraint treatments had some value in habituating rats to humans relative to minimal handling. Nevertheless, tickling was the most effective method for reducing rats' fear of humans and hence improving their emotional welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Learning, memory and regulation of the stress response are mediated by the hippocampus. Biologically relevant hippocampal-dependent tasks that develop and integrate cognitive processing of this region may not be available to piglets in some current production systems. Additionally, weaning piglets at less than two weeks of age may make them particularly vulnerable to disruptions during cognitive development. We measured the effects of a spatial maze task (MT) on the stress response of piglets at weaning (12 days of age) and subsequent fear response (at 7 weeks of age). Twenty-seven pigs from four litters were assigned to one of three treatments: maze task (MT), isolation control (IC), or control with sow (SC), then combined into same sex groups with each treatment represented. Each group was tested four times per day from 5-11 days of age. MT piglets navigated the MT in order to return to the home farrowing crate containing the sow and litter. IC piglets were isolated for the same length of time taken for the MT piglet in their group to navigate the MT. SC piglets controlled for handling and were returned to sow as MT entered the MT. Saliva was collected immediately pre- and post-MT on day 11 to measure cortisol concentrations, which were lower pre-MT (F(1, 8) = 5.65, P = 0.04). Weaning at 12 days of age increased cortisol concentrations 2 h post-weaning (F(4, 75) = 5.67, P < 0.001). When exposed to a modified Morris water maze (MWM), a significant interaction of sex and treatment was found with MT males and IC females faster at solving the MWM than male IC pigs (chi(2)(2) = 9.14, P = 0.01). Lower cortisol concentrations were seen pre-water maze versus post-water maze (F(1, 19) = 27.62, P < 0.001). At 50 days of age, fear response of pigs was examined using three fear-related tests (open field test (OFT), novel object test (NOT), and human approach test (HAT), each consisting of 1 m acclimation and 4 m testing. In the HAT, MT animals had a tendency to touch the unfamiliar person more quickly (F(2, 19) = 2.51, P = 0.10), and more times than animals in other groups (F(2, 49) = 6.31, P = 0.008). MT may result in less fear of novel persons and ameliorate cognitive deficits in male pigs, suggesting benefits of exposing young pigs to environments requiring spatial learning.

AB  - Interest in individual differences in animal behavioural plasticities has surged in recent years, but research in this area has been hampered by semantic confusion as different investigators use the same terms (e.g. plasticity, flexibility, responsiveness) to refer to different phenomena. The first goal of this review is to suggest a framework for categorizing the many different types of behavioural plasticities, describe examples of each, and indicate why using reversibility as a criterion for categorizing behavioural plasticities is problematic. This framework is then used to address a number of timely questions about individual differences in behavioural plasticities. One set of questions concerns the experimental designs that can be used to study individual differences in various types of behavioural plasticities. Although within-individual designs are the default option for empirical studies of many types of behavioural plasticities, in some situations (e.g. when experience at an early age affects the behaviour expressed at subsequent ages), 'replicate individual' designs can provide useful insights into individual differences in behavioural plasticities. To date, researchers using within-individual and replicate individual designs have documented individual differences in all of the major categories of behavioural plasticities described herein. Another important question is whether and how different types of behavioural plasticities are related to one another. Currently there is empirical evidence that many behavioural plasticities [e.g. contextual plasticity, learning rates, IIV (intra-individual variability), endogenous plasticities, ontogenetic plasticities) can themselves vary as a function of experiences earlier in life, that is, many types of behavioural plasticity are themselves developmentally plastic. These findings support the assumption that differences among individuals in prior experiences may contribute to individual differences in behavioural plasticities observed at a given age. Several authors have predicted correlations across individuals between different types of behavioural plasticities, i.e. that some individuals will be generally more plastic than others. However, empirical support for most of these predictions, including indirect evidence from studies of relationships between personality traits and plasticities, is currently sparse and equivocal. The final section of this review suggests how an appreciation of the similarities and differences between different types of behavioural plasticities may help theoreticians formulate testable models to explain the evolution of individual differences in behavioural plasticities and the evolutionary and ecological consequences of individual differences in behavioural plasticities.

AB  - Perinatal brain injury (PBI) leads to neurological disabilities throughout life, from motor deficits, cognitive limitations to severe cerebral palsy. Yet, perinatal brain damage has limited therapeutic outcomes. Besides, the immature brain of premature children is at increased risk of hypoxic/ischemic (HI) injury, with males being more susceptible to it and less responsive to protective/therapeutical interventions. Here, we model in male and female C57BL/6 mice, the impact of neonatal HI and the protective effects of neonatal handling (NH), an early life tactile and proprioceptive sensory stimulation. From postnatal day 1 (PND1, modeling pre-term) to PND21 randomized litters received either NH or left undisturbed. HI brain damage occurred by permanent left carotid occlusion followed by hypoxia at PND7 (modeling full-term) in half of the animals. The behavioral and functional screening of the pups at weaning (PND23) and their long-term outcomes (adulthood, PND70) were evaluated in a longitudinal study, as follows: somatic development (weight), sensorimotor functions (reflexes, rods and hanger tests), exploration [activity (ACT) and open-field (OF) test], emotional and anxiety-like behaviors [corner, open-field and dark-light box (DLB) tests], learning and memory [T-maze (TM) and Morris Water-Maze (MWM)]. HI induced similar brain damage in both sexes but affected motor development, sensorimotor functions, induced hyperactivity at weaning, and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive deficits at adulthood, in a sex-and age-dependent manner. Thus, during ontogeny, HI affected equilibrium especially in females and prehensility in males, but only reflexes at adulthood. Hyperactivity of HI males was normalized at adulthood. HI increased neophobia and other anxiety-like behaviors in males but emotionality in females. Both sexes showed worse short/long-term learning, but memory was more affected in males. Striking neuroprotective effects of NH were found, with significantly lower injury scores, mostly in HI males. At the functional level, NH reversed the impaired reflex responses and improved memory performances in hippocampal-dependent spatial-learning tasks, especially in males. Finally, neuropathological correlates referred to atrophy, neuronal densities and cellularity in the affected areas [hippocampal-CA, caudate/putamen, thalamus, neocortex and corpus callosum (CC)] point out distinct neuronal substrates underlying the sex- and age- functional impacts of these risk/protection interventions on sensorimotor, behavioral and cognitive outcomes from ontogeny to adulthood.

AB  - Simple Summary In times of intensified livestock production, the search for methods that reduce stress, which has an adverse impact on the health and welfare of their animals, has become a challenge for breeders and producers. Therefore, the possibility of using various musical genres to alleviate stress in chickens, cattle or pigs was considered. It has turned out that choosing a musical item is extremely important, as it can positively affect the health and production performance of animals by increasing the feeling of relaxation. The time of exposure to sounds and their intensity are important as well, and some authors propose to also pay attention to the frequency of sound waves. Music therapy, which was previously more widely deployed among humans, is increasingly used for farm animals as an element of enriching their living environment. Current research shows the importance of sound waves' influence in animal production. Proper selection of the music genre, music intensity and tempo can reduce the adverse effects of noise and, thus, reduce the level of stress. It should be remembered, however, that silence is equally important and necessary for the welfare of animals. The paper presents literature findings regarding the influence of music on cattle, poultry and pigs. The welfare of animals, especially those kept in intensive production systems, is a priority for modern agriculture. This stems from the desire to keep animals healthy, to obtain a good-quality final product, and to meet the demands of today's consumers, who have been increasingly persuaded to buy organic products. As a result, new sound-based methods have been pursued to reduce external stress in livestock. Music therapy has been known for thousands of years, and sounds were believed to improve both body and spirit. Today, they are mostly used to distract patients from their pain, as well as to treat depression and cardiovascular disorders. However, recent studies have suggested that appropriately selected music can confer some health benefits, e.g., by increasing the level and activity of natural killer cells. For use in livestock, the choice of genre, the loudness of the music and the tempo are all important factors. Some music tracks promote relaxation (thus improving yields), while others have the opposite effect. However, there is no doubt that enriching the animals' environment with music improves their welfare and may also convince consumers to buy products from intensively farmed animals. The present paper explores the effects of music on livestock (cattle, poultry and pigs) on the basis of the available literature.

AB  - The circadian pacemaking system of birds comprises three major components: (i) the pineal gland, which rhythmically synthesizes and secretes melatonin; (ii) a hypothalamic region, possibly equivalent to the mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei, and (iii) the retinae of the eyes. These components jointly interact, stabilize and amplify, each other to produce a highly self-sustained circadian Output. Their relative contribution to overt rhythmicity appears to differ between species and the system may change its properties even within an individual depending, for example, on its state in the annual cycle or its photic environment. Changes in pacemaker properties are partly mediated by changes in certain features of the pineal melatonin rhythm. It is proposed that this variability is functionally important, for instance, for enabling high-Arctic birds to retain synchronized circadian rhythms during the low-amplitude zeitgeber conditions in midsummer or for allowing birds to adjust quickly their circadian system to changing environmental conditions during migratory seasons. The pineal melatonin rhythm, apart from being involved in generating the avian pacemaking oscillation, is also capable of retaining day length information after isolation from the animal. Hence, it appears to participate in photoperiodic aftereffects. Our results suggest that complex circadian clocks have evolved to help birds cope with complex environments.

AB  - The neuroimmunomodulation hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) postulates that alterations in the innate immune system triggered by damage signals result in adverse effects on neuronal functions. The peripheral immune system and neuroimmunoendocrine communication are also impaired. Here we provide further evi-dence using a longitudinal design that also studied the long-lasting effects of an early life sensorial intervention (neonatal handling, from postnatal day 1-21) in 6-month-old (early stages of the disease) male and female 3xTg-AD mice compared to age-and sex-matched non-transgenic (NTg) mice with normal aging. The behavioral patterns elicited by the direct exposure to an open field, and the motor depression response evoked by NMDA (25 mg/kg, i.p) were found correlated to the organometry of peripheral immune-endocrine organs (thymus involution, splenomegaly, and adrenal glands' hypertrophy) and increased corticosterone levels, suggesting their potential value for diagnostic and biomonitoring.The NMDA-induced immediate and depressant motor activity and endocrine (corticosterone) responses were sensitive to sex and AD-genotype, suggesting worse endogenous susceptibility/neuroprotective response to glutamatergic excitotoxicity in males and in the AD-genotype. 3xTg-AD females showed a reduced immediate response, whereas the NTg showed higher responsiveness to subse-quent NMDA-induced depressant effect than their male counterparts. The long-lasting ontogenic modulation by handling was shown as a potentiation of NMDA-depressant effect in NTg males and females, while sex x treatment effects were found in 3xTg-AD mice. Finally, NMDA-induced corticosterone showed sex, genotype and interaction effects with sexual dimorphism enhanced in the AD-genotype, suggesting different endogenous vulnerability/neuroprotective capacities and modulation of the neuroimmunoendocrine system.

AB  - Simple Summary
   It is important to raise laboratory mice in stable groups. However, sometimes we can find litters with only one male. Unfortunately, age is a factor to consider when grouping a newly weaned mouse with other males due to inter-male aggressiveness. Our results showed that CD1 and SCID Beige newly weaned males can be safely grouped with juvenile and pubescent mice. However, only juvenile C57BL/6J will accept a newly weaned mouse as a new member of the group. This strategy could be helpful to reduce the number of singly housed male mice used for scientific purposes.
   Rearing laboratory mice in groups is important since social isolation after weaning induces brain alterations, which entails behavioral abnormalities in adulthood. Age is an important factor when grouping males of different litters due to inter-male aggressiveness. The aim of this study was to determine whether newly weaned mice could safely be grouped with late juvenile or early and late pubescent mice, and whether cage cleaning, the number of the hosting group members and testosterone plasma levels have any influence. Newly weaned C57BL/6J, CD1, and SCID Beige male mice were systematically grouped with same strain late juvenile, early or late pubescent male mice in clean or dirty cages of 1, 2 or 3 hosting members. We also analyzed plasma testosterone levels at different postnatal days. Our result showed that only strain and hosting male's age influence agonistic behavior toward newly weaned mice. Thus, in order not to house a recently weaned male alone, we would recommend grouping it with late juvenile same strain mice in all studied strains. In the same way, CD1 and SCID Beige pubescent mice will admit a newly weaned mouse in their group. However, we would not recommend grouping newly weaned and pubescent C57BL/6J males.

AB  - Genes and the environment interact to produce complex, environmentally relevant behaviors. We tested whether the behavior of two sister species of striped mice originating from different habitats (semi-arid Rhabdomys pumilio and grassland R. bechuanae) are modulated by the early social rearing environment. We cross-fostered pups between the species, and at adulthood tested their exploratory behavior and anxiety in open field and novel object tests, and a plus maze. We expected that the early social rearing environment would alter the phenotype of both species. Regardless of treatment, R. bechuanae were more exploratory and slightly less anxious than R. pumilio. However, fostered individuals of both species showed no changes in exploratory and anxiety responses. Thus there may be a genetic influence on behavioral development, or the early rearing environments of R. pumilio and R. bechuanae are not sufficiently different to alter behavior.

AB  - Psychosis is a rare, but particularly serious sequela of traumatic brain injury. However, little is known as to the neurobiological processes that may contribute to its onset. Early evidence suggests that psychotic symptom development after traumatic brain injury may co-occur with hippocampal degeneration, invoking the possibility of a relationship. Particularly regarding the hippocampal head, these degenerative changes may lead to dysregulation in dopaminergic circuits, as is reported in psychoses due to schizophrenia, resulting in the positive symptom profile typically seen in post-injury psychosis. The objective of this study was to examine change in hippocampal volume and psychotic symptoms across time in a sample of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury patients. We hypothesized that hippocampal volume loss would be associated with increased psychotic symptom severity. From a database of n = 137 adult patients with prospectively collected, longitudinal imaging and neuropsychiatric outcomes, n = 24 had complete data at time points of interest (5 and 12 months post-traumatic brain injury) and showed increasing psychotic symptom severity on the Personality Assessment Inventory psychotic experiences subscale of the schizophrenia clinical scale across time. Secondary analysis employing stepwise regression with hippocampal volume change (independent variable) and Personality Assessment Inventory psychotic symptom change (dependent variable) from 5 to 12 months post-injury was conducted including age, sex, marijuana use, family history of schizophrenia, years of education and injury severity as control variables. Total right hippocampal volume loss predicted an increase in the Personality Assessment Inventory psychotic experiences subscale (F-(1,F- 22) = 5.396, adjusted R-2 = 0.161, P = 0.030; beta = -0.017, 95% confidence interval = -0.018, -0.016) as did volume of the right hippocampal head (F-(1,F- 22) = 5.764, adjusted R-2 = 0.172, P = 0.025; beta = -0.019, 95% confidence interval = -0.021, -0.017). Final model goodness-of-fit was confirmed using k-fold (k = 5) cross-validation. Consistent with our hypotheses, the current findings suggest that hippocampal degeneration in the chronic stages of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury may play a role in the delayed onset of psychotic symptoms after traumatic brain injury. These findings localized to the right hippocampal head are supportive of a proposed aetiological mechanism whereby atrophy of the hippocampal head may lead to the dysregulation of dopaminergic networks following traumatic brain injury; possibly accounting for observed clinical features of psychotic disorder after traumatic brain injury (including prolonged latency period to symptom onset and predominance of positive symptoms). If further validated, these findings may bear important clinical implications for neurorehabilitative therapies following traumatic brain injury.

AB  - It is of great importance for the highly selective, rapid, and sensitive detection of Cu(II) ion, as copper is an essential element in the environment and the human body, and exposure to high concentrations of Cu(II) will potentially cause health issues. In this work, we have developed a novel catalytic Heck reaction system based on Pd(II)-porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF), PCN-222-Pd(II), to generate highly fluorescent product in the presence of Cu(II). In this system, the achieved signal enlargement toward Cu(II) with high sensitivity not only takes advantage of a stronger binding affinity of Cu(II) over Pd(II) to the nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin, but also a rapid Pd(0)-catalyzed Heck-reaction triggered by the addition of Cu(II) ion. Compared with the previous detection methods, the current fluorescence turn-on approach not only realizes highly selective and sensitive detection of Cu(II) in aqueous solution, but also is able to separate the Cu(II) from the system. This work would open up a new door for MOF applications in the detection of metal ions in complex environments.

AB  - Several studies performed in outbred Roman high- and low-avoidance lines (RHA and RLA, respectively) have demonstrated that the more anxious line (RLA) is characterized by a higher hypothalamic-pituitary-ad renal (HPA) response to certain stressors than the less anxious one (RHA). However, inconsistent results have also been reported. Taking advantage of the generation of an inbred colony of RLA and RHA rats (RHA-1 and RLA-1, respectively), we have characterized in the two strains not only resting and stress levels of peripheral HPA hormones but also central components of the HPA axis, including CRF gene expression in extra-hypothalamic areas. Whereas resting levels of ACTH and corticosterone did not differ between the strains, a greater response to a novel environment was found in RLA-1 as compared to RHA-1 rats. RLA-1 rats showed enhanced CRF gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, with normal arginin-vasopressin gene expression in both parvocellular and magnocellular regions of the PVN. This enhanced CRF gene expression is not apparently related to altered negative corticosteroid feedback as similar levels of expression of brain glucorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors were found in the two rat strains. CRF gene expression tended to be higher in the central amygdala and it was significantly higher in the dorsal region of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) of RLA-1 rats, white no differences appeared in the ventral region of BNST. Considering the involvement of CRF and the BNST in anxiety and stress-related behavioral alterations, the present data suggest that the CRF system may be a critical neurobiological substrate underlying differences between the two rat strains.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of different environmental treatments and personality types on aggression at mixing of newly weaned domestic piglets. From birth to weaning, 16 litters were housed with their dams in either barren (B) or larger, substrate-enriched (E) environments. At 15 days old, piglets were classified as 'high' (HR) or low resistant' (LR) in a manual restraint test (backtest), which is thought to identify proactive (HR) and reactive (LR) stress coping strategies that may reflect different personality types. At 30 days old, 128 piglets were weaned, relocated and mixed into 32 pens comprising two HR and two LR unfamiliar pigs, balanced for sex and weaning weight. Eight B and eight E groups changed environmental condition whereas the others remained in the same type of environment. Number and duration of fights. fight outcomes and unilateral fighting were scored for 5 h post-mixing and skin lesions were counted before and 5 h, 1 day and 2 days after mixing. On the day following weaning, fighting and also exploratory and oral manipulative behaviours were measured for 6 h. Generalized Linear Mixed Model analyses suggested interactions between pre-weaning environment, post-weaning environment and personality type. Overall, pre-weaning E pigs had longer fights at weaning and mixing (P=0.01) and fought for longer on the next day (P=0.02) than pre-weaning B pigs, and inflicted more skin lesions (P=0.02). Post-weaning enrichment did not affect fighting at mixing but reduced the time spent fighting the next day (P=0.03). Personality had subtle and environment-dependent effects on fighting, and influenced the "structure" rather than the amount of aggressive behaviour. HR pigs, for instance, bullied (i.e. chased surrendering pigs) more often (P=0.009) and their fighting behaviour was less affected by their relative body weight than that of LR pigs. Post-weaning E pigs showed relatively higher levels of exploratory behaviour (P=0.02) and less oral manipulative behaviour (P=0.04) than post-weaning B pigs. In particular, switching from a good quality environment (E) to a worse quality one (B) at weaning decreased exploratory behaviour on the next day, especially for LR pigs, who also tended to fight with and orally manipulate their pen mates more in that condition, and seemed to be more affected by a deterioration of the environment. Overall, pre-weaning enrichment increased aggression after weaning whereas post-weaning enrichment reduced it, and personality type related to some aspects of fighting behaviour.

AB  - Apart from regulating somatic growth and metabolic processes, accumulating evidence suggests that the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis is involved in the regulation of brain growth, development, and myelination. In addition, both GH and IGF-I affect cognition and biochemistry in the adult brain. Some of the effects of GH are attributable to circulating IGF-I, while others may be due to IGF-I produced locally within the brain. Some of the shared effects in common to GH and IGF-I may also be explained by cross-talk between the GH and IGF-I transduction pathways, as indicated by recent data from other cell systems. Otherwise, it also seems that GH may act directly without involving IGF-I (either circulating or locally).
   Plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) may be viewed as changes in the functional interplay between the major cell types, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. GH and IGF-I affect all three of these cell types in several ways. Apart from the neuroprotective effects of GH and IGF-I posited in different experimental models of CNS injury, IGF-I has been found to increase progenitor cell proliferation and new neurons, oligodendrocytes, and blood vessels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. It appears that the MAPK signaling pathway is required for IGF-I-stimulated proliferation in vitro, whereas the PI3K/Akt or MAPK/Erk signaling pathway appears to mediate antiapoptotic effects. The increase of IGF-I on endothelial cell phenotype may explain the increase in cerebral arteriole density observed after GH treatment. The functional role of GH and IGF-I in the adult brain will be reviewed with reference to neurotransmitters, glucose metabolism, cerebral blood flow, gap junctional communication, dendritic arborization, exercise, enriched environment, depression, learning, memory, and aging.
   Briefly, these findings suggest that IGF-I functions as a putative regenerative agent in the adult CNS. Hitherto less studied regarding in these aspects, GH may have similar effects, especially as it is the main regulator of IGF-I in vivo. Some of the positive cognitive features of GH treatment are likely attributable to the mechanisms reviewed here.

AB  - The present study was aimed at evaluating whether the differences between the Roman high-(RHA) and low avoidance (RLA) rat strains in novelty-induced behavioural inhibition/disinhibition, sensorimotor gating (i.e., prepulse inhibition, PPI) and spatial learning/memory parallel differences in the volume of brain areas related to those behavioural phenotypes. To this aim, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, we evaluated the performance of adult rats from both strains, either untreated (controls) or treated with neonatal handling (NH; administered during the first 21 days of life), in a novel object exploration test (NOE), in the elevated zero-maze test (ZM) of anxiety, and in a PPI test; moreover, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure the volume of limbic and cortical brain regions (amygdala -Am-, hippocampus -Hc-, striatum -St-, medial prefrontal cortex -mPFc-, anterior cingulate cortex -ACC-, nucleus accumbens -NAc-) and lateral ventricles -LV-. In Experiment 2, adult rats neonatally exposed to NH and their naive controls were submitted to the NOE and PPI tests, and to several spatial learning/memory tasks using the Morris water maze. It was found that, compared with their RLA counterparts, RHA rats show increased exploration of the novel object in the NOE test, lowered anxiety in the ZM and impaired PPI, whereas RLAs display better spatial reference learning and memory and better cognitive flexibility in a reversal task. Furthermore, MRI measurements revealed that the volume of Hc, Am and mPFc is larger in RLA vs. RHA rats, whereas the latter have dramatically enlarged lateral ventricles. NH treatment markedly enhanced exploration in the NOE test in RLA rats, improved PPI in RHA rats but impaired it in their RLA counterparts, and produced beneficial effects on spatial working memory mainly in RHA rats. Finally, exposure to NH decreased the volume of Hc and Am in the RLA strain. The results are discussed in terms of the possible relationships between strain-related volumetric brain differences and the behavioral (anxiety related and schizophrenia-relevant) traits that distinguish RHA from RLA rats, and highlighting the finding that, in RLA rats, NH is for the first time shown to enduringly reduce the volume of Hc and Am in parallel to the decrease of anxiety and the impairment of sensorimotor gating.

AB  - Simple Summary Maternal care in dogs and its impact on the behavioural development of puppies has become the subject of growing research interest. In order to determine the effects of maternal care on the behaviour of family dog puppies, maternal care during the first three weeks after birth was observed in 12 litters of puppies reared in a home environment (72 puppies). The behavioural responses of the puppies were assessed at two months of age, in an arena and an isolation test. In both tests, the amount of maternal care was found to be positively associated with some stress behaviours and, in the arena test, also with the puppies' interest in an unfamiliar person who was present during the test. These behaviours are similar to those observed during the separation of other young mammals from an attachment figure with which they have a high quality of bond. Amount of maternal care was also found to be negatively associated with exploration and play. The difference in results between the present study and our previous study involving laboratory dogs reared in relative social isolation suggests that the developmental trajectory of puppies is influenced by a combination of maternal behaviour and social and physical environmental enrichment.
   Abstract Maternal care has been shown to affect the development of the brain, behaviour, social skills and emotional systems of the young of many mammalian species including dogs. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of maternal care on the behavioural responses of family dog puppies towards environmental and social stimuli. In order to do this, maternal care (licking puppy's ano-genital area, licking the puppy, nursing and mother-puppy contact) during the first three weeks after birth was assessed in 12 litters of domestic dog puppies reared in home environments (total = 72 puppies). The behavioural responses of puppies were assessed in an arena and an isolation test, which were performed when the puppies were two-month old. Data were analysed using principal components analysis and projection to latent structures regression. A systematic relationship was found between maternal care and behaviour in both tests. In the arena test, maternal care was found to be positively associated with approach to the stranger, attention oriented to the stranger, time spent near the enclosure, yawning, whining and yelping ((RY)-Y-2 = 0.613, p = 8.2 x 10(-9)). Amount of maternal care was negatively associated with the number of squares crossed and the time spent individually playing with the rope. In the isolation test, the amount of maternal care was positively associated with standing posture, paw lifting, and howling, and it was negatively associated with yawning, lying down and nose licking ((RY)-Y-2 = 0.507, p = 0.000626). These results suggest that the amount of maternal care received during early life influences the pattern of behavioural responses and coping strategies of puppies at two-months of age. On the basis of these findings it could be speculated that early maternal care contributes to adaption to the environment in which family puppies are developing, with particular regard to social relationships with people.

AB  - Serotonin 1A sub-type receptors play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of depression, which is known to occur more often in females than males. Early experiences can be a predisposing factor for depression; however, the underlying cellular processes remain unknown. In an effort to address such issues, we employed neonatal handling, an experimental model of early experience, which has been previously shown to render females more vulnerable to display enhanced depression-like behavior in response to chronic stress, while it increases the ability of males to cope. In rat pre-pubertal (30 days of age) and adult (90 days) hippocampus, of both males and females, the effect of neonatal handling on serotonin 1A sub-type receptor mRNA and protein levels was determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively, while the number of binding sites was determined by in vitro autoradiography using [H-3]8-hydroxy2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin as the ligand. Our results revealed a significant sex difference in serotonin 1A sub-type receptor mRNA, protein and binding sites, with females having higher levels than males. Handling resulted in statistically significant decreased numbers of cells positive for serotonin 1A sub-type receptor mRNA or protein, as well as [H-3]8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin binding sites in the area 4 of Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus of both pre-pubertal males and females. In adult animals the number of serotonin 1A sub-type receptor mRNA positive cells was increased as a result of handling in the area I of Ammon's horn, area 4 of Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus of males, while it was decreased only in the area 4 of Ammon's horn of females. Furthermore, the number of serotonin sub-type 1A receptor immunopositive cells, as well as [H-3]8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin binding sites was increased in the area 1 of Ammon's horn, area 4 of Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus of handled males, whereas it was decreased in these same brain areas in the handled females. We can thus infer that neonatal handling results in alterations in postsynaptic serotonergic neurotransmission, which may contribute to the sex dimorphic effects of handling as to the vulnerability toward depression-like behavior in response to chronic stressful stimuli.

AB  - Pair housing of laboratory macaques is widely considered to lead to positive changes in well-being, yet the process of introduction is viewed as potentially stressful and risk-prone. Behavioral and physiological data were collected on eight adult male rhesus macaques before, during, and after the process of introduction, in order to measure the initial stress of introduction as well as long-term changes in well-being. Socially experienced subjects, all implanted with biotelemetry devices, were studied in five successive phases: baseline (singly housed), I day each of protected contact and full contact introduction, post-introduction (1-3 weeks after introduction), and settled pairs (>= 20 weeks after introduction). One hundred and seventy-six hours of behavioral data and 672 hr of heart rate data were analyzed. Fecal cortisol was also measured for the baseline, post-introduction, and settled pair phases. All introductions were successful and subjects showed no physiological or behavioral signs of stress, such as increased heart rate, abnormal behavior, or psychological indices of distress (depressive/anxiety-related behavior). Agonism was minimal throughout the introduction process and over the subsequent months; only one wound was incurred over the course of the study. Levels of abnormal behaviors, psychological indices of distress, locomotion, inactivity, and affiliation showed improvements within several weeks after introduction; these changes were still present 5-9 months later for the latter two categories. Heart rates during introduction fell significantly in the settled pair phase, and also varied predictably with time of day. Fecal cortisol levels were lower in settled pairs than in single housing. The fact that reductions in abnormal behavior did not persist over the long term may have been confounded by increasing duration of time spent caged. The results of this study may be of practical use for designing and monitoring social introductions and suggest that managers should not dismiss the feasibility of successful pairing of adult male rhesus macaques.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 on the elderly is devastating, and nursing homes are struggling to provide the best care to the most fragile. The urgency and severity of the pandemic forces the use of segregation in restricted areas and confinement in individual rooms as desperate strategies to avoid the spread of disease and the worst-case scenario of becoming a deadly trap. The conceptualization of the post-COVID-19 era implies strong efforts to redesign all living conditions, care/rehabilitation interventions, and management of loneliness forced by social distance measures. Recently, a study of gender differences in COVID-19 found that men are more likely to suffer more severe effects of the disease and are over twice as likely to die. It is well-known that dementia is associated with increased mortality, and males have worse survival and deranged neuro-immuno-endocrine systems than females. The present study examines the impact of long-term isolation in male 3xTg-AD mice modeling advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and as compared to age-matched counterparts with normal aging. We used a battery of ethological and unconditioned tests resembling several areas in nursing homes. The main findings refer to an exacerbated (two-fold increase) hyperactivity and emergence of bizarre behaviors in isolated 3xTg-AD mice, worrisome results since agitation is a challenge in the clinical management of dementia and an important cause of caregiver burden. This increase was consistently shown in gross (activity in most of the tests) and fine (thermoregulatory nesting) motor functions. Isolated animals also exhibited re-structured anxiety-like patterns and coping-with-stress strategies. Bodyweight and kidney weight loss were found in AD-phenotypes and increased by isolation. Spleen weight loss was isolation dependent. Hippocampal tau pathology was not modified, but asymmetric atrophy of the hippocampus, recently described in human patients with dementia and modeled here for the first time in an animal model of AD, was found to increase with isolation. Overall, the results show awareness of the impact of isolation in elderly patients with dementia, offering some guidance from translational neuroscience in these times of coronavirus and post-COVID-19 pandemic. They also highlight the relevance of personalized-based interventions tailored to the heterogeneous and complex clinical profile of the individuals with dementia and to consider the implications on caregiver burden.

AB  - Social deprivation in early life disrupts emotionality and attentional processes in humans. Rearing rats in isolation reproduces some of these abnormalities, which are attenuated by daily handling. However, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying these responses remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that post-weaning social isolation alters the endocannabinoid system, a neuromodulatory system that controls emotional responding. We characterized behavioral consequences of social isolation and evaluated whether handling would reverse social isolation-induced alterations in behavioral reactivity to context and the endocannabinoid system. At weaning, pups were single or group housed and concomitantly handled or not handled daily until adulthood. Rats were tested in emotionality- and attentional-sensitive behavioral assays (open field, elevated plus maze, startle and prepulse inhibition). Cannabinoid receptor densities and endocannabinoid levels were quantified in a separate group of rats. Social isolation negatively altered behavioral responding. Socially-isolated rats that were handled showed less deficits in the open field, elevated plus maze, and prepulse inhibition tests. Social isolation produced site-specific alterations (supraoptic nucleus, ventrolateral thalamus, rostral striatum) in cannabinoid receptor densities compared to group rearing. Handling altered the endocannabinoid system in neural circuitry controlling emotional expression. Handling altered endocannabinoid content (prefrontal and piriform cortices, nucleus accumbens) and cannabinoid receptor densities (lateral globus pallidus, cingulate and piriform cortices, hippocampus) in a region-specific manner. Some effects of social isolation on the endocannabinoid system were moderated by handling. Isolates were unresponsive to handling-induced increases in cannabinoid receptor densities (caudal striatum, anterior thalamus), but were sensitive to handling-induced changes in endocannabinoid content (piriform, prefrontal cortices), compared to group-reared rats. Our findings suggest alterations in the endocannabinoid system may contribute to the abnormal isolate phenotype. Handling modifies the endocannabinoid system and behavioral reactivity to context, but surmounts only some effects of social isolation. These data implicate a pivotal role for the endocannabinoid system in stress adaptation and emotionality-related disturbances. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

AB  - Simple Summary The laboratory fish model plays an important role in modern scientific research. Ensuring the welfare of laboratory fish is beneficial to the repeatability of experimental results. Laboratory fish will face some stressors in the process of feeding and management, but there are few studies on this part. Our study shows that unpredictable chronic stress for 7 and 14 days can lead to a significant decrease in growth and cortisol levels of laboratory rare minnow. At the same time, the behaviour pattern and neurotransmitter response changed more significantly with the increase of time. Therefore, we should try to reduce the duration and intensity of these stressors to ensure their welfare needs in daily feeding management. Fishes often adjust their behaviour patterns and physiological responses to cope with changing environments, and different life experiences affect them differently. Fishes might adapt to short-term stress, whereas long-term unpredictable stress may lead to various adverse effects. Although some studies have constructed unpredictable stress models of fish, the effect of unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) in the laboratory is poorly understood in fishes. In the current study, we exposed adult rare minnow to an unpredictable chronic stress protocol over 7 and 14 days and measured their response in terms of growth performance, cortisol, neurotransmitter levels (DA, 5-HT, and related metabolites), and behaviour patterns to comprehensively assess the effects of UCS on laboratory rare minnow. We discovered that specific growth rates were significantly decreased, and cortisol levels were lowered in both 7-days and 14-days stress groups. In the behaviour test, the activity level of the 14-days stress group increased, but there was no significant difference in the number of crossings to the center areas, time spent in the center areas, or the speed. In addition, the levels of DA and 5-HT did not change in the stress groups, but the DOPAC and 5-HIAA levels in the 14 days stress group were significantly higher than those in the control group. These results suggested that UCS influences rare minnow growth performance, behaviour patterns, and cortisol levels, and similar stress should be minimised in the laboratory.

AB  - Background. The long-term success of ex-situ conservation programmes depends on species-appropriate husbandry and enrichment practices complemented by an accurate welfare assessment protocol. Zoos and conservation breeding programmes should employ a bottom-up approach to account for intraspecific variations in measures of animal welfare. We studied 35 (14:21) captive Asiatic lions in Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Junagadh, India to understand the implications of individual variations on welfare measures. We categorized the subjects based on personality traits (bold or shy), rearing history (wild-rescued or captive-raised), sex, and social-grouping. We explored the association of these categorical variables on welfare indices such as behavioural diversity, latency to approach novel objects, enclosure usage and aberrant repetitive behaviours. Further, we assessed the inter-relationships between different behavioural measures of welfare.
   Results. Our results show that intraspecific variations based on rearing-history and personality traits are significantly associated with the welfare states of captive Asiatic lions. Asiatic lions with bold personality traits (M = 0.50, SD = 0.12, N = 21) and those raised in captivity (M = 0.47, SD = 0.12, N = 16) used enclosure space more homogenously compared to shy (M = 0.71, SD = 0.15, N = 14) and wild-rescued (M = 0.67, SD = 0.15, N = 19) animals. Behaviour diversity was significantly higher in captive-raised (M = 1.26, SD = 0.3, N = 16) and bold (M = 1.23, SD = 0.26, N = 21) subjects compared to wild-rescued (M = 0.83, SD = 0.35, N = 19) and shy (M = 0.73, SD = 0.34, N = 14) individuals. Aberrant repetitive behaviours (stereotypy) were significantly lower in bold (M = 7.01, SD = 4, N = 21) and captive-raised (M = 7.74, SD = 5.3) individuals compared to wild-rescued (M = 13.12, SD = 6.25, N = 19) and shy (M = 16.13, SD = 5.4, N = 16) lions. Sex and social-grouping of subjects did not show significant associations with behavioural welfare indices. Interestingly, behaviour diversity was reliably predicted by the enclosure usage patterns and aberrant repetitive behaviours displayed by subjects.
   Discussion. Our findings underline the importance of individual-centric, behaviour-based, and multi-dimensional welfare assessment approaches in ex-situ conservation programmes. The results suggest that behavioural welfare indices complemented with individual variations can explain inter-individual differences in behavioural welfare measure outcomes of Asiatic lions. These findings also provide zoo managers with a non-invasive tool to reliably assess and improve husbandry practices for Asiatic lions. Understanding the unique welfare requirement of individuals in captivity will be crucial for the survival of the species.

AB  - Change in the sleeping environment can produce significant alterations in sleep. To determine how these alterations may vary with the amount of change and the relative reactivity of the sleeper, we examined the influences of environmental novelty on sleep in two mouse strains that differ in behavioral anxiety. Mice [BALB/cJ (n=7) and C57BL/6J (n=8)] were implanted for recording EEG and activity via telemetry. Following baseline data collection, activity and sleep were examined over 46 h after routine cage change, after placing a simple novel object (PVC Tee) in the home cage, and after handling controls. Mice of both strains showed immediate increases in activity and decreases in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and non-REM (NREM) after cage change and novel object. Within strain, changes in activity and sleep were greater after cage change than after novel object. Changes in activity and sleep time were significantly correlated in each strain. Compared to C57BL/6J mice, BALB/cJ mice exhibited greater and longer duration initial reductions in sleep time, and greater increases in EEG slow wave activity power after cage change and novel object, but these changes were not followed with subsequent increases in sleep time. In contrast, C57BL/6J mice showed significantly greater subsequent increases in sleep time following the initial reductions induced by both manipulations. The results suggest that initial decreases and subsequent increases in sleep time are related to putative differences in the intensity of environmental novelty (cage change > novel object) and to previously described strain differences in anxiety (BALB/cJ > C578L/6J).

AB  - Growing pigs can display undesirable behaviours, reflecting or causing poor welfare. Addition of magnesium (Mg) to the diet could reduce these, as Mg supplementation has been associated with improved coping ability in response to stress. This study examined the effect of supplementation with a Mg-rich marine extract-based product (Supplement) on the behaviour, skin and tail lesion scores and salivary cortisol concentrations of growing pigs. At weaning (28 days), 448 piglets were assigned to either Control or Supplement (0.05%) diets in single-sex groups of 14. Four weeks later (c. 17 kg), pigs were blocked according to weight and back test scores. Seven piglets from each pen were mixed with seven from another pen of the same sex and dietary treatment to yield the following groups: control male, Supplement male, control female and Supplement female (n = 4 of each). This marked the start of the 9-week experimental period. Instances of the following behaviours were recorded in each pen for 8 x 2 min periods 1 day/week: aggression (fight, head-knock and bite); harmful (tail-in-mouth, ear-chewing and belly-nosing); and sexual/mounting behaviour. Four focal pigs were selected from each pen, and their behaviour was continuously recorded for 235 min periods on the same day. Saliva was collected once per week at 1000 h by allowing pigs to chew on a cotton bud for c. 1 min. Salivary cortisol was analysed in duplicate by an enzyme immunoassay. Skin and tail lesions were scored according to severity 1 day/week. There were fewer aggressive incidents in Supplement pens (P < 0.01), and mounting behaviour (performed only by males) was almost three times lower in Supplement than in control pens (P < 0.01). However, there was no effect of Supplement on the incidence of each of the harmful behaviours. Behaviour of the focal pigs showed no treatment effect on the duration or incidence of aggressive behaviour. However, Supplement pigs spent less time performing harmful behaviours compared with control pigs (P < 0.001). Supplement had no effect on the occurrence or severity of tail-biting outbreaks or on tail lesion scores. However, Supplement females had lower skin lesion scores, in particular in the ears and shoulders (P < 0.01). Finally, Supplement pigs had lower salivary cortisol concentrations (P < 0.01). Mounting is a major welfare concern in uncastrated pigs, and therefore this represents an important welfare benefit of Supplement. Reduced salivary cortisol, in conjunction with reduced skin lesion scores in supplemented females, suggests that addition of a Mg-rich marine extract improved pig welfare in this system.

AB  - Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS), these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing, male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood. The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments. Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown. However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic mechanisms. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary: The effect of housing on rodent well-being has received increasing scrutiny in recent years in North America in an attempt to define adequate standards of animal care. Typically, the adequacy of cage size is determined by species and body weight, with little consideration being given to the cage complexity and impact on animal welfare. Further, most studies evaluate different caging methods over relatively short periods of time, which may not be realistic for typical colony settings. Inappropriate housing may lead to boredom, aggression, and the development of abnormal behaviour and function, which in turn may affect animal responses during research protocols. In this study, we evaluated the impact of group housing rats by sex in double wide cages with the addition of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes for shelter, a nylon chew toy, and a piece of food enrichment given three times weekly over the course of five months. These groups were compared to rats that were single or pair-housed by sex in standard cages provided only with a nylon chew toy. We found that group-housed rats were more active and continued to engaged in positive social behaviours, such as grooming, for the duration of the study, with minimal impact on other aspects of animal function.
   Abstract: There is considerable interest in refining laboratory rodent environments to promote animal well-being, as well as research reproducibility. Few studies have evaluated the long term impact of enhancing rodent environments with resources and additional cagemates. To that end, male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were housed singly (n = 8/sex), in pairs (n = 16/sex), or in groups of four (n = 16/sex) for five months. Single and paired rats were housed in standard cages with a nylon chew toy, while group-housed rats were kept in double-wide cages with two PVC shelters and a nylon chew toy and were provided with food enrichment three times weekly. Animal behaviour, tests of anxiety (open field, elevated plus maze, and thermal nociception), and aspects of animal physiology (fecal corticoid levels, body weight, weekly food consumption, organ weights, and cerebral stress signaling peptide and receptor mRNA levels) were measured. Significant differences were noted, primarily in behavioural data, with sustained positive social interactions and engagement with environmental resources noted throughout the study. These results suggest that modest enhancements in the environment of both male and female SD rats may be beneficial to their well-being, while introducing minimal variation in other aspects of behavioural or physiologic responses.

AB  - Sediments of aquatic ecosystems constitute the fate of most atmospheric and terrestrial pollutants. Since aquatic organisms, such as amphibians, interact with sediments, the presence of pollutants may affect their survival, growth and reproduction. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate, the sediment and water quality of five sites from the lower basin of the Paran acute accent a River (Buenos Aires, Argentina) with different anthropic impacts: Morej acute accent on stream (S1), de la Cruz stream upstream (S2) and downstream (S3), Arrecifes river (S4), tributary stream of Arrecifes river (S5). Physicochemical parameters were measured in situ (water) and in laboratory (water and sediment samples). Also, a screening of metals and pesticides was performed. Chronic (504 h) lethal toxicity bioassays were performed exposing Rhinella arenarum larvae to sediment and water samples. Oxidative stress (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S transferase, reduced glutathione and lipid peroxidation) and genotoxicity (micronuclei test) biomarkers were analyzed at acute (96 h) exposure. According to the calculated water quality index, S1 and S3 showed excellent quality, S2 good quality and, S4 and S5 poor quality. Dissolved oxygen was low in all sites (2.26-5.63 mg/L) and S5 had the highest organic matter content. Copper levels exceeded the limit for the protection of aquatic life in S2 and S4; arsenic levels exceeded its limit in S4; and selenium levels exceeded its limit in S4 and S5. Pesticides were mainly detected in water samples. Sediment from S5 showed higher sulfide and organic matter concentrations. At 504 h, no significant mortality was observed in the control group while S5 caused the greatest mortality (80%), followed by S2 (66.67%), S1 (63.33%), S3 (46.67%) and S4 (43.4%). All samples caused oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, and samples from S4 also caused genotoxicity. The analysis of sediment and water samples was a suitable approach to assess the effects of water bodies on a native amphibian species.

AB  - Background: Over 120 million mice and rats are used annually in research, conventionally housed in shoebox-sized cages that restrict natural behaviours (e.g. nesting and burrowing). This can reduce physical fitness, impair thermoregulation and reduce welfare (e.g. inducing abnormal stereotypic behaviours). In humans, chronic stress has biological costs, increasing disease risks and potentially shortening life. Using a pre-registered protocol (https:// atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/17955), this meta-analysis therefore tested the hypothesis that, compared to rodents in 'enriched' housing that better meets their needs, conventional housing increases stressrelated morbidity and all-cause mortality.
   Results: Comprehensive searches (via Ovid, CABI, Web of Science, Proquest and SCOPUS on May 24 2020) yielded 10,094 publications. Screening for inclusion criteria (published in English, using mice or rats and providing 'enrichments' in long-term housing) yielded 214 studies (within 165 articles, using 6495 animals: 59.1% mice; 682% male; 31.8% isolation-housed), and data on all-cause mortality plus five experimentally induced stress-sensitive diseases: anxiety, cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression and stroke. The Systematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool assessed individual studies' risks of bias. Random-effects meta-analyses supported the hypothesis: conventional housing significantly exacerbated disease severity with medium to large effect sizes: cancer (SMD = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.54-0.88); cardiovascular disease (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.35-1.09); stroke (SMD = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.59-1.15); signs of anxiety (SMD = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.56-1.25); signs of depression (SMD = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.98-1.49). It also increased mortality rates (hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.25-1.74; relative median survival = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.89-0.94). Meta-regressions indicated that such housing effects were ubiquitous across species and sexes, but could not identify the most impactful improvements to conventional housing. Data variability (assessed via coefficient of variation) was also not increased by 'enriched' housing.
   Conclusions: Conventional housing appears sufficiently distressing to compromise rodent health, raising ethical concerns. Results also add to previous work to show that research rodents are typically CRAMPED (cold, rotund, abnormal, male-biased, poorly surviving, enclosed and distressed), raising questions about the validity and generalisability of the data they generate.

AB  - Plants live in complex environments and need to cope with various biotic and abiotic stresses. Plant secondary metabolites are not only medicines/supplements for humans but are also important weapons used by plants for defense. Chicoric acid is the main active ingredient and is a major secondary metabolite of purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench). A special acyl donor changed serine carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferase catalyzes chicoric acid biosynthesis from caftaric acid and chlorogenic acid. The biological role of chicoric acid in purple coneflower and the significance of its biosynthesis being catalyzed by an acyl donor changed acyltransferase remain unclear. In the present study, correlation analysis and various in vitro experiments were investigated. Chicoric acid contents among different purple coneflower accessions were found to be negatively correlated with latitude, which indicated a possible role in ultraviolet protection. Ultraviolet light induced oxidative stress in purple coneflower leaves and upregulation of chicoric acid biosynthetic genes. However, chicoric acid was consumed by reactive oxygen species to alleviate oxidative stress. Chicoric acid provided ultraviolet protection by acting as a sunscreen and antioxidant agent. Notably, chicoric acid exhibited stronger ultraviolet absorption and antioxidant activity than the sum of its two substrates, which indicated the significance of its biosynthesis by an acyl donor changed acyltransferase. This study also implied that low doses of ultraviolet light might be good elicitors for simulating chicoric acid biosynthesis in purple coneflower.

AB  - The optic flow, i.e., the displacement of retinal images of objects in the environment induced by self-motion, is an important source of spatial information, especially for fast-flying insects. Spatial information over a wide range of distances, from the animal's immediate surroundings over several hundred metres to kilometres, is necessary for mediating behaviours, such as landing manoeuvres, collision avoidance in spatially complex environments, learning environmental object constellations and path integration in spatial navigation. To facilitate the processing of spatial information, the complexity of the optic flow is often reduced by active vision strategies. These result in translations and rotations being largely separated by a saccadic flight and gaze mode. Only the translational components of the optic flow contain spatial information. In the first step of optic flow processing, an array of local motion detectors provides a retinotopic spatial proximity map of the environment. This local motion information is then processed in parallel neural pathways in a task-specific manner and used to control the different components of spatial behaviour. A particular challenge here is that the distance information extracted from the optic flow does not represent the distances unambiguously, but these are scaled by the animal's speed of locomotion. Possible ways of coping with this ambiguity are discussed.

AB  - RNA viruses have high error rates, and the resulting quasispecies may aid survival of the virus population in the presence of selective pressure. Therefore, it has been theorized that RNA viruses require high error rates for survival, and that a virus with high fidelity would be less able to cope in complex environments. We previously isolated and characterized poliovirus with a mutation in the viral polymerase, 3D-G64S, which confers resistance to mutagenic nucleotide analogs via increased fidelity. The 3D-G64S virus was less pathogenic than wild-type virus in poliovirus-receptor transgenic mice, even though only slight growth defects were observed in tissue culture. To determine whether the high-fidelity phenotype of the 3D-G64S virus could decrease its fitness under a defined selective pressure, we compared growth of the 3D-G64S virus and 3D wild-type virus in the context of a revertible attenuating point mutation, 2C-F28S. Even with a 10-fold input advantage, the 3D-G64S virus was unable to compete with 3D wild-type virus in the context of the revertible attenuating mutation; however, in the context of a non-revertible version of the 2C-F28S attenuating mutation, 3D-G64S virus matched the replication of 3D wild-type virus. Therefore, the 3D-G64S high-fidelity phenotype reduced viral fitness under a defined selective pressure, making it likely that the reduced spread in murine tissue could be caused by the increased fidelity of the viral polymerase.

AB  - Background: Recent work on non-human primates indicates that the allocation of social attention is mediated by characteristics of the attending animal, such as social status and genotype, as well as by the value of the target to which attention is directed. Studies of humans indicate that an individual's emotion state also plays a crucial role in mediating their social attention; for example, individuals look for longer towards aggressive faces when they are feeling more anxious, and this bias leads to increased negative arousal and distraction from other ongoing tasks. To our knowledge, no studies have tested for an effect of emotion state on allocation of social attention in any non-human species.
   Methodology: We presented captive adult male rhesus macaques with pairs of adult male conspecific face images - one with an aggressive expression, one with a neutral expression - and recorded gaze towards these images. Each animal was tested twice, once during a putatively stressful condition (i.e. following a veterinary health check), and once during a neutral (or potentially positive) condition (i.e. a period of environmental enrichment). Initial analyses revealed that behavioural indicators of anxiety and stress were significantly higher after the health check than during enrichment, indicating that the former caused a negative shift in emotional state.
   Principle Findings: The macaques showed initial vigilance for aggressive faces across both conditions, but subsequent responses differed between conditions. Following the health check, initial vigilance was followed by rapid and sustained avoidance of aggressive faces. By contrast, during the period of enrichment, the macaques showed sustained attention towards the same aggressive faces.
   Conclusions/Significance: These data provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that shifts in emotion state mediate social attention towards and away from facial cues of emotion in a non-human animal. This work provides novel insights into the evolution of emotion-attention interactions in humans, and mechanisms of social behaviour in non-human primates, and may have important implications for understanding animal psychological wellbeing.

   Partial sensory deprivation (deafferentation) by removing whiskers from the rat snout resulted in a reduced responsiveness of related cortical representations. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (three blocks of intermittent theta-burst) applied for 5 days in combination with sensory exploration restored the normal responsiveness level of the deafferented barrel cortex. However, intracortical inhibition (lateral and recurrent) appeared to be reduced after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, probably as the cause of improved responsiveness. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation also reduced the asymmetry of the lateral spread of sensory activity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates human cortical excitability. It has the potential to support recovery to normal cortical function when the excitation-inhibition balance is altered (e.g. after a stroke or loss of sensory input). We tested cortical map plasticity on the basis of sensory responses (local field potentials, LFPs) and expression of neuronal activity marker proteins within the barrel cortex of rats receiving either active or sham rTMS after selective unilateral deafferentation by whiskers plucking. Rats received daily rTMS [intermittent theta-burst (iTBS), active or sham] for 5 days before exploring an enriched environment. Our previous studies indicated a disinhibitory effect of iTBS on cortical activity. Therefore, we also expected disinhibitory effects if deafferentation causes depression of sensory responses. Deafferentation resulted in an acute general reduction of sensory responsiveness and enhanced expression of inhibitory activity markers (GAD67, parvalbumin) in the deafferented hemisphere. Active but not sham-iTBS-rTMS normalized these measures. The stronger caudal-to-frontal horizontal spread of activity across barrels was reduced after deafferentation but not restored after active iTBS, despite generally increased responses. Fitting the LFP data with a computational model of different strengths and types of excitatory and inhibitory connections further revealed an iTBS-induced reduction of lateral and recurrent inhibition as the most probable scenario. Whether the disinhibitory effect of iTBS for the restoration of normal cortical function in the acute phase of depression after deafferentiation is also beneficial in humans remains to be demonstrated. As recently discussed, disinhibition appears to be required to open a window for neuronal plasticity.

AB  - Simple Summary Captive chimpanzee locomotion, including walking, climbing, brachiating, and hanging, is a species-typical behavior and increased locomotion is generally considered to indicate improved welfare. However, the relationship between locomotion and welfare is nuanced, and there is a limited number of studies that have used locomotion as a welfare indicator. We summarize findings from four previously published studies that showed increased locomotion in captive chimpanzees under social and physical environmental conditions is associated with enhanced welfare, including increases in space per animal and changes in the type of housing, housing in larger and more diverse groups, and during participation in an experimental medication choice paradigm. New data also showed that higher levels of locomotion are related to higher levels of behavioral diversity (an indicator of positive welfare), and lower levels of abnormal behavior and inactivity (behavioral indicators of negative welfare). Given this evidence, we suggest that time spent in locomotion can be used as a sensitive measure of welfare in captive chimpanzees. Locomotion in non-human primates, including walking, climbing, and brachiating among other types of movement (but not pacing), is a species-typical behavior that varies with age, social housing conditions, and environmental factors (e.g., season, food availability, physical housing conditions). Given that captive primates are typically observed to engage in lower levels of locomotor behaviors than their wild counterparts, increases in locomotion are generally considered to be indicative of improved welfare in captivity. However, increases in locomotion do not always occur with improvements in welfare, and sometimes occur under conditions of negative arousal. The use of time spent in locomotion as a welfare indicator in studies of well-being is relatively limited. We conducted focal animal observations on 120 captive chimpanzees across a series of studies and found higher percentages of time spent in locomotion (1) upon transfer to a new enclosure type, (2) in larger groups with wider within-group age ranges, and fewer males, and (3) with participation in an experimental medication choice paradigm. We also found that, among geriatric chimpanzees, those housed in nongeriatric groups exhibited more locomotion than those living in geriatric groups. Lastly, locomotion was significantly negatively correlated with several indicators of poor welfare and significantly positively correlated with behavioral diversity, one indicator of positive welfare. Overall, the increases in time spent in locomotion observed in these studies were part of an overall behavioral pattern indicative of enhanced welfare, suggesting that an increase in time spent in locomotion itself may be an indicator of enhanced welfare. As such, we suggest that levels of locomotion, which are typically assessed in most behavioral experiments, may be used more explicitly as indicators of welfare in chimpanzees.

AB  - Differences in the temperament of individuals may influence how animals cope with environmental challenges and must be considered in a pre-release training program. In this study we aimed to evaluate individual distinctiveness in the expression of exploratory and anti-predatory behaviors of red-browed Amazon parrots (Amazona rhodocorytha) during a pre-release training program. We assessed individuals' behavioral traits by both direct observation and rating methods during an open field test. Thereafter, we provided feeding and a physical environmental enrichment schedule following the A(1)BA(2) paradigm (A(1) and A(2): control phases and B: enriched phase; Heffner, 2004) to evaluate parrots' behavioral responses. Next, we evaluated parrots' anti predatory reactions by presenting a predator-like model (stuffed Caracara plancus). In this last test, we collected behavioral data during two phases: pre-presentation and during the presentation of the predator model. Fifty days later, we recorded the behavioral responses after new presentation of the same predator-like model during the learning-retention test. Parrots spent more time in exploratory behavior during the B enriched phase (P = 0.002) than in both control phases. In contrast, the time spent in a state of alertness was similar (P = 0.16) during both predator-like exposure phases. Individuals rated as more anxious spent more time on exploratory behaviors during the enriched phase (r(pearson) = 0.63, P = 0.05). There was, however, no correlation between the rating scores and the proportion of time parrots remained in a state of alertness during both predator-model exposure phases (P > 0.05). Thus, independent of their behavioral traits, all parrots were prompt to escape from predators. Our results support the importance of evaluating individuals' behavioral differences before releasing them and suggest that setting up groups including individuals with different capabilities to explore the environment and to face aversive stimuli should increase their post-release survival when facing environmental challenges during foraging and/or predation events.

AB  - We studied effects of two weaning procedures on the development of pigs raised in a multi-suckling (MS) system with five sows and their litters. One MS group was subjected to a gradual weaning treatment during a lactation period of 9 wk, which included forced intermittent-suckling (IS) for 10 h/d during the fifth wk of lactation, followed by a 4-wk period in which sows could voluntarily get away from their piglets (IS9 treatment). The other MS group was weaned abruptly at 4 wk of age and was subsequently housed in a nursery (A4 treatment). At 9 wit of age, pigs from both treatments were relocated to a finishing unit, where they were housed in a group of max. 35 pigs per treatment. Five consecutive batches of 10 sows and their litters were studied. Weaning had a more profound impact for the A4 pigs than IS and sow-initiated separation did for the IS9 pigs, demonstrated by a lower weight gain between d 27-33 (0.90 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.51 +/- 0.06 kg/pig, F-1,F-4 = 25.23, p < 0.01), indications of a higher diarrhea occurrence, a distinct peak in belly-nosing behavior and numerically higher levels of aggression and damaging oral manipulation between wk 4-9. For IS9 pigs, weaning seemed to have less impact; feed intake after transition to the finishing unit was similar in both treatments, indicating that IS9 pigs had a more successful transition to a diet of only solid feed, and IS9 pigs showed no growth check, nor behavioral indicators of having difficulty coping with the post-weaning situation. The extended weaning process likely gradually prepared the gastro-intestinal tract to process solid feed, which may explain the better performance of the IS9 pigs. Additionally, benefits of the gradual weaning treatment were reflected in behavioral differences over the entire experiment; between 4-18 wk of age, IS9 pigs overall showed less belly-nosing, less damaging oral manipulation and had fewer lesions related with manipulation and aggression than A4 pigs. This may altogether indicate a less stressed state of the IS9 pigs. To conclude, 159 pigs coped better with both transitions than A4 pigs did and the gradual weaning treatment had long-term beneficial effects, particularly concerning behavior. Therefore, gradual weaning in a multi-suckling system seems promising for improving piglet performance, behavior and welfare.

AB  - Pigs housed together in a group influence each other's growth. Part of this effect is genetic and can be represented in a social breeding value. It is unknown, however, which traits are associated with social breeding values. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate whether personality and response to novelty could be associated with social breeding values for growth in piglets. Female and castrated male piglets from 80 litters, with either an estimated relative positive or negative social breeding value (+SBV or -SBV) for growth, were individually tested in a backtest and novel environment test, and group-wise in a novel object (i.e., a feeder with feed) test and human approach test. All tests were performed during the suckling period. No differences between +SBV and -SBV piglets were found for the frequency and latency of struggling and vocalizing in the backtest (at least, P > 0.30). In the novel object test, piglets with a +SBV for growth touched the feeder faster than piglets with -SBV for growth (P = 0.01) and were more frequently present near the person in the human approach test (P < 0.01). No behavioral differences between +SBV and -SBV pig-lets were found in the novel environment test (at least, P > 0.40), but piglets that struggled more in the backtest walked more in this test (P = 0.02). Behavior was affected by gender in each test. Female piglets were faster than castrated male piglets to start struggling in the backtest (P = 0.047). In the novel object test, females were faster than males to touch the feeder and sample the feed. In the human approach test, they were also faster than male piglets to touch a person (all, P < 0.001). Females were also more frequently present near the feeder (P < 0.001) and person (P = 0.03). In the novel environment test, female piglets explored the floor more (P = 0.046), produced less low-(P = 0.04) and high-pitched vocalizations (P = 0.02), and defecated (P = 0.08) and urinated less than male piglets (P < 0.01). It was concluded that +SBV and -SBV piglets do not differ in their response to the backtest, and only subtle differences were found in their response to novelty. More research is warranted to identify the traits underlying SBV for growth in pigs. Moreover, castrated male piglets seemed to react more fearfully to each test than female piglets.

AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) exclusively colonize and infect humans and are critical to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In vitro and animal models do not accurately capture the complex environments encountered by NTHi during human infection. We conducted whole-genome sequencing of 269 longitudinally collected cleared and persistent NTHi from a 15-y prospective study of adults with COPD. Genome sequences were used to elucidate the phylogeny of NTHi isolates, identify genomic changes that occur with persistence in the human airways, and evaluate the effect of selective pressure on 12 candidate vaccine antigens. Strains persisted in individuals with COPD for as long as 1,422 d. Slipped-strand mispairing, mediated by changes in simple sequence repeats in multiple genes during persistence, regulates expression of critical virulence functions, including adherence, nutrient uptake, and modification of surface molecules, and is a major mechanism for survival in the hostile environment of the human airways. A subset of strains underwent a large 400-kb inversion during persistence. NTHi does not undergo significant gene gain or loss during persistence, in contrast to other persistent respiratory tract pathogens. Amino acid sequence changes occurred in 8 of 12 candidate vaccine antigens during persistence, an observation with important implications for vaccine development. These results indicate that NTHi alters its genome during persistence by regulation of critical virulence functions primarily by slipped-strand mispairing, advancing our understanding of how a bacterial pathogen that plays a critical role in COPD adapts to survival in the human respiratory tract.

AB  - Chronic maternal stress during pregnancy has been associated with behavioral alterations that persist into adulthood. Moreover, adoption procedures performed immediately after birth can reverse these alterations. In this study, we examined the effects of prenatal restraint stress and adoption at birth (cross-fostering) on the behavioral response to an anxiety-provoking situation and on the adult male offspring expression of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors in selected brain areas. Adult offspring of rats stressed during the last week of pregnancy exhibited higher levels of anxiety than control rats. The anxiogenic behavior found at the elevated plus maze (EPM) has been related to the reduced levels of BDZ receptor levels in specific brain areas. Adult offspring of rats stressed during pregnancy exhibited a decrease in the number of BDZ receptors binding sites in the central amygdaloid nucleus (Ce), CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus when compared to controls. Regarding the adoption procedure, control pups raised by a foster gestationally stressed mother showed similar levels of anxiety as stressed groups. Stressed offspring raised by a foster control mother showed reduced anxiety levels compared to that of the control groups. Adoption per se showed no difference in time spent, neither in the open arms of the plus maze nor in BDZ receptor levels, when compared to the corresponding control and stressed groups. Stressed offspring raised by a foster control mother reverted BDZ receptor levels to control values. However, control pups raised by a gestationally stressed foster mother showed similar values compared to the control offspring in hippocampus, in spite of showing an anxiogenic behavior in the EPM. We found a significant increase of Ce BDZ receptor levels in control offspring raised by a foster stressed mother that could be explained as a compensatory effect to a GABA receptor desensitization. In summary, the behavioral outcome of the adult offspring is vulnerable both to the stress experience during the late prenatal period as well as to possible variations in care during lactation by mothers subjected to chronic stress during gestation. There seems to be a direct correlation between anxiety state and BDZ receptor levels in the adult offspring raised by their biological mothers. However, the mechanism of BDZ regulation leading to an anxious behavior might be different if the insult is received only postnatally as opposed to both pre and postnatally.

AB  - Effects of sub-optimal housing on inactivity vary across species and experiments, probably because inactivity is heterogeneous, reflecting both positive states (e.g. relaxation) and negative ones (e.g. fear). We therefore aimed to identify specific subtypes of inactivity that could indicate poor welfare in mink, by comparing their behaviour in enriched and non-enriched conditions (the former having been previously demonstrated to be highly preferred by mink and to enhance their welfare). We assessed this in three groups of subjects, as well as after housing conditions were reversed for the last group. During live scans, inactive animals were scored for posture, location, and whether awake or apparently asleep. Data on temperament and physiological stress indicators were also collected for one group; these confirmed that non-enriched housing increased faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM; P = 0.040). Non-enriched housing also increased locomotor stereotypy in females (sex x housing: P = 0.004). Inactivity in the nest-box (vs. in the open cage) was higher among females in non-enriched housing (housing x sex: P < 0.001), and increased by 20% of observations after enrichment removal (P = 0.018) for both sexes. Furthermore, males With fearful temperaments spent the most time inactive in the nest-box (sex x temperament: P = 0.054), while females whose FCM decreased most when given enrichment also showed the largest decreases in this behaviour (sex x FCM change: P = 0.019). Together, this suggests that inactivity in the nest-box may reflect anxiety-induced hiding. Lying awake (i.e. prone with eyes open) was also higher in non-enriched housing (3.1% of observations vs. 1.7%; P = 0.002); furthermore, this subtype of inactivity increased after enrichment removal (by 1.0% of observations; P = 0.021), and decreased when non-enriched mink were given enrichment (by 2.4% of observations; P = 0.004). This behaviour did not co-vary with fearfulness, however, nor with FCM (both P > 0.05). This suggests that lying awake is not fear-related (e.g. not reflecting enhanced vigilance) but instead reflects some other negative state. Effects on inactivity subtypes as defined by posture were less consistent. For example, time spent lying belly down tended to decrease in mink moved from non-enriched to enriched cages (P = 0.054), but enriched mink spent significantly less time belly down (in one of the three groups; P = 0.002). Overall, two subtypes of inactivity, lying in the nest-box and lying awake seem likely to be valid indicators of housing-induced poor welfare in this species, being consistently increased by non-enriched cages. Lying in the nest-box may indicate fear or anxiety, and lying awake, a boredom-like state. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The socialisation period in dog puppies (approx. 3-12 weeks) is one of the most important periods in determining later behaviour. Nonetheless, only a few studies investigated how socialisation can be optimised. Here, we tested whether providing small "challenge" exercises to puppies early in the socialisation period (between 3 and 6 weeks of age) enables puppies to cope better with stressful stimuli later. Eighty-three puppies from 12 litters of various breeds were enrolled. Half of each litter was assigned to the treatment group and was carefully exposed to potentially startling stimuli, novel objects, and problem-solving tasks over a period of three weeks. The other half of the litter served as a control group and received no additional exercises. All puppies were tested in a behaviour test at 6-7 weeks of age. Puppies from the treatment group were bolder towards a novel object, startled less after a loud noise, solved the problem-solving task faster, and showed higher persistence in problem-solving task than the control group. These findings demonstrate beneficial effects of the exercises. However, at the age of six months, there were no differences in owner-reported personality measures between the groups. To achieve lasting effects, it may be necessary to continue with the training exercises for a longer time period. The socialisation period in dog puppies is one of the most important periods determining behavioural development in dogs. Here, we aimed to test the effect of providing stimulation (beyond mere exposure) early during the socialisation period (approx. 3-6 weeks) on puppies' behaviour. Each of 12 litters (83 puppies) of various breeds was divided into a treatment and a control group. Between 3-6 weeks, the treatment group received age-appropriate "challenge" exercises (carefully graded noise exposure, novel objects, and problem-solving tasks) four times per week (total 12 times). The control group spent the same time with the trainer, who cuddled or played with the puppies. In a behaviour test at 6-7 weeks, two of four principal components, "social-startle" and "response to novelty", differed significantly between the groups. Treatment puppies were bolder towards the novel object, showed a reduced startle reaction, and recovered more quickly after a loud noise. Furthermore, they accomplished the problem-solving task faster and were more persistent during problem-solving than the control group. The control group showed a higher interest in a friendly stranger. It is a possibility that increased handling experienced by the control group had beneficial effects on their sociability. No long-term effects of the treatment were found, as determined by a validated dog personality questionnaire, available for 67 dogs at the age of six months. Likely, a continuation of the treatment over a longer time period would be necessary to obtain lasting effects, since the training took place only during the first third of the socialisation period.

AB  - In the present work five trials have been carried out. In the first series, the effect of every day's occupation on the rats' behaviour was studied. Two groups of three male rats were raised under physically identical environmental conditions, but the members of the experimental groups received individual personal care, whilst the control individuals get only minimal human contact. Tests were carried out at the age of 15 weeks. Trial 1: 8-hour-long whole ethogram of randomly chosen individuals of both groups was taken, registered the sleeping/rest, eating, drinking, grooming and inquisitory behaviour. There was no expressed difference between the daylight activities of the two groups, except that the control rats spent more time with eating (36 vs. 17% of the awake 8-h-long period). Trial 2: separate 5-minute-long openfield test has been made with each individual. Socialised rats showed more activity (average walking time 48 +/- 10.4 vs. 34 +/- 12.5 s, prancing 80 +/- 30.8 vs. 66 +/- 36 s, grooming 74 +/- 51 vs. 42 +/- 21.6 s) (Figure 1). Differences are not significant (p>0.05) because of the standard deviation of the data. Trial 3: hiding in running time has been measured with each individual, three times, in 2-minute-interval. A hiding place has been put in a corner of the vivarium and the frequency and duration of running and staying in of the newly placed in animal was studied. The first running into the hiding place of the control rats occurred every times later (after 15.2 +/- 12.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.9 s), but the average staying of the socialised (255 +/- 29.9 s) and control (243 +/- 32.3 s) individuals and the number of running in did not differ significantly. Trial 4: the reaction of rats on an unexpected stimulus has been registered. Animals were observed individually during six minutes in the experimental vivarium and the open-field behaviour patterns registered. At the end of the third minutes rats were exposed to a strong vocal stimulus (handclap) and after that the duration of getting erect (freezing or startling time) and the changes in the ethogram were studied. The socialised animals get frozen for less period of time owing to the handclaps (3, 8, 1 vs. 36, 14, 31 s) and their behaviour pattern significantly changed, contrary to the control rats' one. In the second series the effect of faster, "rodentized" human music on the rats' behaviour has been studied. Trial 5: Ten weaned, experimentally naive male rats have been used in a simplified open-field test. After having recorded the 5-minutes-long basic behaviour, animals were exposed to the ten times faster version of "Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major K 448" piece of MOZART, known in the human psychology. Rats unanimously perceived the music, their basal behaviour changed, but owing to the great individual deviations the differences are not significant (Figure 2). In summation it can be concluded that in case of rats, above the physical environmental enrichment tools, both the human socialisation and the human music may improve the animals' welfare as an enlargement of the third "R", the refinement.

AB  - Moods influence cognitive processes in that people in positive moods expect more positive events to occur and less negative ones ("optimistic bias"), whereas the opposite happens for people in negative moods ("pessimistic bias"). The evidence for an effect of mood on cognitive bias is also increasing in animals, suggesting that measures of optimism and pessimism could provide useful indicators of animal welfare. For obvious ethical reasons, serious poor treatments cannot be easily replicated in large mammals in order to study their long-term effects on moods. In this study, we tested the long-term effects (>2 years) of prior poor welfare on the moods of rescued goats at an animal sanctuary, using a spatial judgement bias experiment. A group of goats that had experienced poor welfare before arriving at the sanctuary ("poor welfare group"; n = 9 goats) was compared with another group of goats that had experienced generally good care ("control group"; n = 9 goats). We first trained the goats to discriminate between a rewarded and a non-rewarded location. We then compared the responses of the two groups of goats to ambiguous locations situated between the two reference locations. Our results showed that, after three days of training, both groups could equally discriminate rewarded and non-rewarded locations. There was no overall effect of the welfare group during the test, but there was an interaction effect between sex and welfare group. Surprisingly, females from the poor welfare group (n = 4) reacted in the opposite way to that predicted, and showed a more optimistic bias than control females (n = 5). This suggests that these females could be experiencing long-term optimistic bias triggered by release from stress. They were also more optimistic than males from the same group (n = 5). Male judgement bias did not differ between the poor welfare and control groups (n = 4 controls). Therefore, our results show that after several years of good care, rescued goats displayed optimistic moods (females) or similar moods as controls (males). This suggests that goats probably recover from neglect, and that sex differences in mood potentially exist. The optimistic or pessimistic biases experienced by domestic animals are likely to have a strong impact on their abilities to cope with their environment, and more generally on their welfare.

AB  - The effect of the preweaning housing system on the stress response of pigs before weaning and during fattening was studied in 33 litters of domestic pigs. Three preweaning housing systems were compared: barren crate (standard farrowing crate without straw), enriched crate (20% larger crate, with straw), and as a control, a farrowing pen (pen, 60% larger than the barren crate, with straw). At 25 d of age, pigs were tested with an isolation test and 1 d later with a human approach test (HumanT). Pigs were weaned at 28 d of age. At 3 and 6 mo of age, pigs were tested with an isolation-human approach test. The latency and frequency of squeal calls and locomotor activity were analyzed for all 3 tests, whereas physical contact with the human was also analyzed for the HumanT and isolation-hunian approach test. At 6 mo of age, the pigs were transported to a slaughterhouse. One day before transport, immediately after transport, and 1 h after transport, saliva samples were taken for cortisol analysis. The pH of the LM was also measured 45 min after slaughter. Preweaning housing system affected (P < 0.05) the probability of squeal vocalizations, the latency of locomotion, and the duration of locomotion during the HumanT. Pigs from the enriched pens vocalized less, had a longer latency to move, and performed less overall locomotion than pigs from the barren crates. Preweaning housing system did not affect behavior of fattening pigs. Cortisol concentrations before and after transport were not affected by preweaning housing system. An interaction of cortisol concentrations and housing systems was observed between the control sample and the sample taken immediately after transport in pigs from the barren crates (P < 0.05) compared with pigs from the enriched housing systems. Meat from pigs reared in the barren crate tended to have lower pH (P < 0.10) and that of pigs reared in enriched crates had lower pH (P < 0.05) than meat of pigs reared in enriched pens. No differences were observed between pigs from barren or enriched crates. Our results suggest that enrichment of the preweaning environment through enlarged space, provision of straw, and free movement for the sow had a positive effect on the coping behavior of pigs before weaning and prevented an increase in salivary cortisol concentration immediately after transport and a decrease in meat pH 45 min postmortem at the age of 6 mo. Minimal enrichment of the commercial farrowing crate did not affect behavior and physiological measures in pigs before and after weaning.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are a widely distributed group of microorganisms in the ocean, and they often need to cope with the stress of reactive sulfur species, such as sulfide and sulfane sulfur. Sulfane sulfur refers to the various forms of zero-valent sulfur, including persulfide, polysulfide, and element sulfur (S-8). Although sulfane sulfur participates in signaling transduction and resistance to reactive oxygen species in cyanobacteria, it is toxic at high concentrations and induces sulfur stress, which has similar effects to oxidative stress. In this study, we report that Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 uses peroxiredoxin to cope with the stress of cellular sulfane sulfur. Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 contains six peroxiredoxins, and all were induced by S-8. Peroxiredoxin I (PrxI) reduced S-8 to H2S by forming a disulfide bond between residues Cys(53) and Cys(153) of the enzyme. A partial deletion strain of Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 with decreased copy numbers of the prxI gene was more sensitive to S-8 than was the wild type. Thus, peroxiredoxin is involved in maintaining the homeostasis of cellular sulfane sulfur in cyanobacteria. Given that peroxiredoxin evolved before the occurrence of O-2 on Earth, its original function could have been to cope with reactive sulfur species stress, and that function has been preserved. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacteria are the earliest microorganisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis, which has played a key role in the evolution of life on Earth, and they are the most important primary producers in the modern oceans. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 uses peroxiredoxin to reduce high levels of sulfane sulfur. That function is possibly the original role of peroxiredoxin, as the enzyme evolved before the appearance of O-2 on Earth. The preservation of the reduction of sulfane sulfur by peroxiredoxin5-type peroxiredoxins may offer cyanobacteria an advantage in the complex environment of the modern oceans.

AB  - Many of the stressor treatments used in animal models of depression have parallels in the normal experiences of domestic pigs. The experiment described here aimed to assess whether a chronic-intermittent stress regime caused behavioural or physiological changes, indicative of depression, in domestic pigs.
   Ten juvenile male pigs were exposed to a social and environmental stress regime. Over the stressor period, weight gain was significantly lower in test pigs than in control pigs. Stress treatment had a significant effect on salivary cortisol levels, with test pigs having a higher salivary cortisol concentration than control pigs after the stress treatment but not before. Test pigs showed less ventral lying than control pigs in the post-stress observation. A detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of postural behavioural organisation showed that test pigs had a more structured pattern of activity than controls in the post-stress observation and a tendency towards a more structured pattern in the pre-stress observation. There were no major behavioural differences between the two groups during three repeated open field tests.
   The results suggest that the stressor treatment did create a mild chronic stress, as indicated by the hypercortisolaemia and lower weight gain in the test pigs. However, no unambiguous behavioural indicators of depression were seen. The behavioural analysis did show that fractal techniques, such as DFA, could be applied to pig behaviour and that they can reveal extra novel information about the structure of an individual's behavioural organisation and how it changes in response to complex environmental stressors.

AB  - In order to assess and avoid risks for both human and environmental health, there is a high need for cost-effective and sensitive detection systems suitable for the monitoring of chemical contaminants in food and the environment. Due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, affinity-based detection systems are interesting for monitoring tools. Antibodies have long been the most popular affinity-based recognition elements, however, recently different novel affinity-based recognition elements with improved characteristics, like specificity, stability and cost-efficiency, have gained attention. In the present study, one type of such novel affinity-based recognition elements, namely landscape phages were evaluated as substitute antibodies for detection of PCB. These phages with affinity for PCBs were selected from a landscape phage library, in which each phage displays an 8-mer peptide at all 4000 major coat proteins pVIII. Landscape phages have potential as biorecognition elements, because of their excellent characteristics, such as high affinity and specificity, fast, cheap and animal-friendly manufacturing process with low batch-to-batch variations and superior stability, which allow them to operate as elements of detector systems in complex environmental and food matrices. Phages with a high specificity for PCB106 were isolated from the landscape phage library. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) it was shown that the selected phages bind specifically PCB106 and do not bind PCB72 and PCB118. The dissociation constants (K-d) of the phage binding with PCB106 were in mu M range. After further improvement of their binding activity, the specific PCB-binding phages can be used as biorecognition elements for food and environmental monitoring.

AB  - Pigs are commonly kept in intensive farming systems. Their use as model animals in biomedical research has increased. Both conditions may impact upon their welfare. Recent definitions of welfare emphasize the importance of emotion. Mood congruent biases in judgement have been proposed as proxy measures of emotion in animals; optimistic responses to ambiguous cues are said to reflect positive emotional states while negative biases reflect negative emotional states. We developed a novel active-choice task to measure judgement bias in conventional farm pigs (n=7) and Gottingen minipigs (n=8). Pigs were trained to distinguish a positive tone-cue, from a negative tone-cue, signalling the location (goal-box) of large or small rewards respectively. After learning this discrimination pigs were presented with a series of ambiguous tone-cues and the percentage of choices for the positive goal-box recorded as optimistic responses (phase I). After a 4-week break, pigs were retrained and challenged with a restraint treatment to induce a negative emotional state. judgement bias was again measured (phase II). After another 2-week break, a third test was performed to assess the effect of repeated testing (phase III). Minipigs learned the initial discrimination faster than conventional pigs but there were no differences in subsequent relearning (Breed: F-1,F-13=21.47, P=0.0005; Phase: F-2,F-26=121.56, P<0.0001; Breed*Phase: F-2,F-26=10.53, P=0.0004). Both groups responded similarly in our judgement bias task (F-1,F-13=2.70, P=0.1241) and both showed a reduction in optimistic responses after the first test (F-1,F-28,F-16.59=15.08, P=0.0007). This reduction was likely due to learning about the outcomes of ambiguous cues, which potentially masked any effect of the restraint treatment. The comparable performance between the two breeds suggests that the task is suited for both breeds, and that research from one of these breeds can be generalized to the other, across farm and laboratory housing and management conditions. Advantages of an active choice task for assessing judgement bias are discussed, and questions are raised about the suitability of this task for repeated and longitudinal assessment of judgement biases in pigs.

AB  - IntroductionEvidence of animal personality and behavioral syndromes is widespread across animals, yet the development of these traits remains poorly understood. Previous research has shown that exposure to predators, heterospecifics, and urbanized environments can influence personality and behavioral syndromes. Yet, to date, the influence of early social experiences with conspecifics on the development of adult behavioral traits is far less known. We use swordtail fish (Xiphophorus nigrensis), a species with three genetically-determined male mating strategies (courtship display, coercion, or mixed strategy) to assess how different early-life social experiences shape adult behavioral development. MethodsWe raised female swordtails from birth to adulthood in density-controlled sexual-social treatments that varied in the presence of the type of male mating tactics (coercers only, displayers only, coercers and displayers, and mixed-strategists only). At adulthood, we tested females' boldness, shyness, aggression, sociality, and activity. ResultsWe found that the number of different mating strategies females were raised with (social complexity) shaped behavioral development more than any individual mating strategy. Females reared in complex environments with two male mating tactics were bolder, less shy, and less aggressive than females reared with a single male mating tactic (either courtship only or coercion only). Complex sexual-social environments produced females with behavioral syndromes (correlations between aggression and activity, shyness and aggression, and social interaction and activity), whereas simple environments did not. DiscussionImportantly, the characteristics of these socially-induced behavioral syndromes differ from those driven by predation, but converge on characteristics emerging from animals found in urban environments. Our findings suggest that complexity of the sexual-social environment shapes the development of personality and behavioral syndromes to facilitate social information gathering. Furthermore, our research highlights the previously overlooked influence of sexual selection as a significant contributing factor to diverse behavioral development.

AB  - Spatial orientation is an important skill as it improves, for example, foraging, localisation of recourses, predator avoidance or navigation. Habitat complexity positively affects spatial abilities in various fish species with a more complex environment promoting learning ability. However, to what extent a complex social environment affects cognitive abilities in fishes has received less attention. Here, we investigated differences in maze performance of adult females of the West African cichlid fish Pelvicachromis taeniatus, which had been reared and maintained either in a group or in isolation from an early age on. Fish had to master the route through a maze in order to gain a food reward. Our results indicate marked differences in performance contingent upon social rearing-environment isolation fish ran successful trials (i.e. locating the food reward) significantly more often than group fish and were faster during trials, also in a reversed maze. However, the number of mistakes did not differ between isolation and group fish and the time needed to relocate the food reward did not diminish with elapsed training days. In a second experiment, the activity of group and isolation fish was analysed in an open field test. Here, isolation fish were less active than group fish. We discuss different possibilities for performance differences of group and isolation fish including enhanced cognitive abilities of isolation fish, motivational/emotional differences and hyperactivity.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning involves multiple stressors and is one of the most critical periods for piglets. It is known that pigs try to compensate stressful events by different coping strategies that might culminate in the biting of other pigs. The reduction in the number of stressors by optimizing housing conditions might be a way to reduce tail biting, one huge challenge in modern pig production. Since tail docking as a measure to avoid injuries is banned by EU regulations, this study aims to present alternatives to combat tail biting. The present work shows that the group housing of lactating sows and their litters improves pig welfare after regrouping events in terms of skin lesions. Rearing in the farrowing pen with reduced regrouping positively affected the incidence of tail lesions and losses of undocked pigs. Against expectations, free farrowing and group housing systems had no negative impact on later performance during rearing or fattening. Feasible alternatives to stressful weaning and tail-docking are needed to inhibit tail biting. Therefore, we investigated the effects of housing systems for 1106 pigs that were weaned from: (1) conventional farrowing crates (FC), (2) free-farrowing pens (FF), or (3) group housing of lactating sows (GH) into (1) conventional rearing pens (Conv) or (2) piglets remained in their farrowing pens for rearing (Reaf). Tails were docked or left undocked batchwise. All pigs were regrouped for the fattening period. Pigs were scored for skin lesions, tail lesions and losses. After weaning, Conv-GH pigs had significantly less skin lesions than Conv-FC and Conv-FF pigs. After regrouping for fattening, Reaf-GH pigs had significantly less skin lesions than Conv pigs, Reaf-FC and Reaf-FF. The frequency of tail lesions of undocked Conv pigs peaked in week 4 (66.8%). Two weeks later, Reaf undocked pigs reached their maximum (36.2%). At the end of fattening, 99.3% of undocked Conv pigs and 43.1% of undocked Reaf pigs lost parts of their tail. In conclusion, the co-mingling of piglets during suckling reduced the incidence of skin lesions. Rearing in the farrowing pen significantly reduced the incidence of tail lesions and losses for undocked pigs. No housing system negatively affected the performance.

AB  - Much attention has been given to effects of repeated exposure to a shock wave as a possible factor causing severe higher brain dysfunction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms in patients with mild to moderate blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). However, it is unclear how the repeated exposure and the inter-exposure time affect the brain. In this study, we topically applied low-impulse (similar to 54 Pa.s) laser-induced shock waves (LISWs; peak pressure, similar to 75.7 MPa) to the rat brain once or twice with the different inter-exposure times (15 min, 1 h, 3 h, 24 h and 7 days) and examined anxiety-related behavior and motor dysfunction in the rats as well as expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) as an axonal damage marker in the brains of the rats. The averaged APP expression scores for the rat brains doubly-exposed to LISWs with inter-exposure times from 15 min to 24 h were significantly higher than those for rats with a single exposure (P < 0.0001). The rats with double exposure to LISWs showed significantly more frequent anxiety-related behavior (P < 0.05) and poorer motor function (P < 0.01) than those of rats with a single exposure. When the inter-exposure time was extended to 7 days, however, the rats showed no significant differences either in axonal damage score or level of motor dysfunction. The results suggest that the cumulative effects of shock wave-related brain injury can be avoided with an appropriate inter-exposure time. However, clinical bTBI occurs in much more complex environments than those in our model. Further study considering other factors, such as the effects of acceleration, is needed to know the clinically-relevant, necessary inter-exposure time.

AB  - Simple Summary Changes in cortisol fluctuations are used for stress monitoring. Methodologically, this is straight forward, because sample collection is simple and analytical methods advanced, but since cortisol is primarily a hormone that facilitates energy allocation, the interpretation of these measures is often complex. Acute elevations in cortisol levels are not per se bad, but may constitute an adaptive coping mechanism. Likewise, low cortisol levels do not always indicate the absence of a stressor. To distinguish between stress response qualities, a more fine-grained analyses of cortisol fluctuations is warranted. Cortisol excretion follows a diurnal pattern with high levels in the morning, decreasing throughout the day. Two regression coefficients describe this curve: the intercept (the constant with which levels change throughout the day) and the slope (curve steepness and direction). We assessed salivary cortisol intercepts and slopes in zoo-housed apes on routine days, enrichment days, and in the new ape house. While cortisol excretion increased on enrichment days, the daily decline of cortisol levels was not affected. The move to the new house seemingly was a major stressor as cortisol levels increased slightly and the circadian cortisol decrease was impaired. The combination of intercept and slope measures can differentiate between stress responses, thereby constituting a useful tool for stress monitoring. Monitoring changes in cortisol levels is a widespread tool for measuring individuals' stress responses. However, an acute increase in cortisol levels does not necessarily denote an individual in distress, as increases in cortisol can be elicited by all factors that signal the need to mobilize energy. Nor are low levels of cortisol indicative for a relaxed, healthy individual. Therefore, a more fine-grained description of cortisol patterns is warranted in order to distinguish between cortisol fluctuations associated with different stress response qualities. In most species, cortisol shows a distinct diurnal pattern. Using a reaction norm approach, cortisol levels across the day can be described by the two regression coefficients: the intercept and the slope of the curve. We measured immunoreactive salivary cortisol in three zoo-housed ape species under three conditions (routine days, enrichment days, and after the move to a new house). We examined salivary cortisol intercepts (SCI) and salivary cortisol slopes (SCS) of the diurnal curves. SCI and SCS were independent from each other. SCI was highest on enrichment days and lowest on routine days. SCS was steep on routine days and blunted after the move. Only SCI was species-specific. Our study provides evidence that combining SCI and SCS measures allows us to differentiate between types of stress responses, thereby constituting a useful tool for welfare assessment.

AB  - Objective: This article presents research on the effects of varying mood and stress states on within-team communication in a simulated crisis management environment, with a focus on the relationship between communi-cation behaviors and team awareness.
   Background: Communication plays a critical role in team cognition along with cognitive factors such as attention, memory, and decision-making speed. Mood and stress are known to have interrelated effects on cognition at the individual level, but there is relatively little joint exploration of these factors in team communication in technologically complex environments.
   Method: Dyadic communication behaviors in a distributed six-person crisis management simulation were analyzed in a factorial design for effects of two levels of mood (happy, sad) and the presence or absence of a time pressure stressor.
   Results: Time pressure and mood showed several specific impacts on communication behaviors. Communication quantity and efficiency increased under time pressure, though frequent requests for information were associated with poor performance. Teams in happy moods showed enhanced team awareness, as revealed by more anticipatory communication patterns and more detailed verbal responses to teammates than those in sad moods.
   Conclusion: Results show that the attention-narrowing effects of mood and stress associated with individual cognitive functions demonstrate analogous impacts on team awareness and information-sharing behaviors and reveal a richer understanding of how team dynamics change under adverse conditions.
   Application: Disentangling stress from mood affords the opportunity to target more specific interventions that better support team awareness and task performance.

AB  - Contamination of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by arsenic (As) is a very sensitive environmental issue due to its adverse impact on human health. Although not anthropogenic in origin, the problem of As contamination in groundwaters of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh has been considered of calamitous proportion because significant segment of the population is at high risk, with untold numbers already suffering from irreversible effects of As poisoning. Elsewhere, indiscriminate disposal of industrial and mining wastes has led to extensive contamination of lands, thereby exacerbating the potential for food chain contamination. With greater public awareness of As poisoning in animal and human nutrition. there has been a growing interest in developing regulatory guidelines and remediation technologies for mitigating As-contaminated ecosystems. Although the immediate needs revolve around the stripping of As from domestic water supplies as exemplified by the affected areas in Bangladesh and West Bengal, a remediation scheme should also be explored to be able to cope with pivotal needs to abate the contamination of soils, sediments and water and the potential to compromise the quality of the food chain. A range or technologies, including bioremediation, has been applied with varying levels of success either to remove As from the contaminated medium or to reduce its biotoxicity. This review provides general overview of the various biogeochemical processes that regulate As bioavailability to organisms, including microbes, plants, animals and humans, In turn, the role of the source term, chemical form and chemical species of As are discussed as an overture to As bioavailability, Having laid the fundamental mechanisms and factors regulating As bioavailability, we then assembled the various physical. chemical, and biological mitigative methods that have been demonstrated, some being practical. highlighting their special strengths and potential for more effective and economical widespread applications. Because of the complexity involved in dealing with contaminated sites. exacerbated by site characteristics, nature or hydrogeology, source term, chemical form, land use, and so on, no one remedial technology might suffice. Therefore, we have attempted to offer an "integrated" approach of employing a combination of technologies at multiscalar levels, depending on extenuating circumstance, with the aim of securing viable methods, economically and technologically. Future research needs. especially in the area of As bioavailability and remediation strategies, are identified. (c) 2005, Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim The aim of the study was to validate a rapid method to detect and quantify colistin resistance genes (mcr-1tomcr-5) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in diverse matrices. Methods and results The detection limit of two newly designed SYBR Green real-time PCR assays formcr-4andmcr-5and of previously published protocols formcr-1tomcr-3was assessed using serial dilutions of reference strains. The assays could detect all fivemcrgenes with the lower limit of 10(2)copy numbers.Escherichia coliisolates (n = 1062) and environmental samples (n = 93) were tested for the presence ofmcrgenes. The assays enabled the detection of colistin resistance genes both in bacterial isolates and in complex environmental samples. Conclusions This method represents a set of sensitive, rapid and effective assays for the screening of colistin resistance directly from the environment. Significance and Impact of the Study Colistin is an antimicrobial commonly used in animals and has recently emerged as a last-resort treatment in humans. Plasmid-mediatedmcrgenes confer resistance to colistin and represent a major threat for public health since they can be easily disseminated through horizontal gene transfer. The rapid and sensitive detection ofmcrgenes is of utmost necessity.

AB  - Seawater intrusion into fresh groundwater formations generally results inadvertently from human activities, such as over-abstraction from coastal aquifers. This article describes the data analysis to quantify drain-aquifer interactions in a low-lying pump-drained coastal aquifer, which is subject to saline intrusion due to widespread land drainage, and the resulting development and application of a numerical groundwater model to understand the spatial groundwater system behaviour (including groundwater salinity fluxes). Without measured flow data in this pump-drained catchment, a novel groundwater head-dependent approach to hydrograph separation is described. Time-variant and time-invariant MODFLOW analyses are utilised to examine the flow processes. A new approach to calculate drain coefficients, which represent the extensive network of drainage ditches in the regional model, using field information, is described; the sum of the drainage coefficients are close to the values independently estimated from the head-dependent hydrograph separation. Results show that (1) the groundwater flows into the drainage systems are well reproduced using the new drain coefficients, (2) particle tracking of fresh and saline water can explain observed spatial salinity distribution within drainage networks and (3) the modelled flow of seawater across the coast is approximately 25% greater than that discharged by the pumps, demonstrating the need for drainage management to be aware of the slow response of groundwater systems to past drainage system changes. The article demonstrates that numerical groundwater modelling can produce the improved understanding needed to inform management decisions in such complex environments.

AB  - Simple Summary The formation and maintenance mechanism of personality is a hot topic in personality research. The boldness of the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) has the greatest influence on its behavior, but the physiological factors leading to the stability of and difference in boldness are not yet clear. In this study, the factors affecting the formation and maintenance of and change in the boldness of swimming crabs are investigated from the perspectives of behavior, physiology, and neurotransmitters. The results show that the differences in boldness among crabs remain consistent for a long time and are closely related to the body's energy and neurotransmitter metabolism. Boldness of personality is an important theme in animal behavior and has significant ecological and evolutionary consequences. Studies on boldness in crustaceans typically focus on their behavior, while relatively few studies have focused on the formation and maintenance of and change in boldness, such as energy metabolism and neurotransmission. In this study, we measured the boldness of swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) and analyzed the relationship between boldness and oxygen consumption rate, energy concentration, and the relative expression of energy-metabolism-related and 5-HT genes in mRNA. The results showed that boldness remained stable across repeated tests but changed under dangerous conditions. Swimming crabs could be divided into bold and shy individuals. Bold individuals consumed oxygen at a significantly higher rate than shy individuals. Lactate and glucose concentrations in hemolymph were significantly lower in bold individuals than in shy individuals, and mRNA relative expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and 5-HT genes was significantly higher in bold than in shy individuals. Preliminary results indicate that energy metabolism and neurotransmitters may underlie the formation and maintenance of personality characteristics of swimming crabs. Swimming crabs also exhibit behavioral flexibility in order to cope with risks. This may be an adaptation to their complex environments.

AB  - Behavioural responses to stress occur in an environment-dependent manner. Complex environments require flexible behavioural coping strategies and chronic stress usually generates psychomotor inhibition. Here, we examine if short-term stress also exerts an inhibitory effect on novelty-seeking, exploratory behaviours. Rats underwent acute restraint stress or were left undisturbed, and their neuroendocrine and behavioural responses were assessed at short- and long-term time points. Animals were individually tested in the open field task (OFT) and the corridor field task (CFT) with and without a central object for free exploration and novelty seeking behaviour. Stress-related psychomotor alterations were measured by path speed, path length, number of stops and thigmotaxis in both tasks. Short-term stress activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis causing elevated plasma corticosterone levels. Stress also impacted psychomotor functions in terms of motivational changes (higher speed and longer path) only in the central-object variations of the OFT and CFT. Moreover, stress-induced emotional alterations were manifested by a higher number of stops and thigmotactic behaviour only in the central-object condition. These findings suggest that environmental landmarks determine the type and direction of exploratory behaviour under transient stress.

AB  - GL1 is a golden-yellow leaf mutant that cultivated from natural bud-mutation of Lagerstroemia indica and has a very low level of photosynthetic pigment under sunlight. GL1 can gradually increase its pigment content and turn into pale-green leaf when shading under sunshade net (referred as Re-GL1). The mechanisms that cause leaf color variation are complicated and are not still unclear. Here, we have used a label-free comparative proteomics to investigate differences in proteins abundance and analyze the specific biological process associated with mechanisms of leaf color variation in GL1. A total of 245 and 160 proteins with different abundance were identified in GL1 vs WT and GL1 vs Re-GL1, respectively. Functional classification analysis revealed that the proteins with different abundance mainly related to photosynthesis, heat shock proteins, ribosome proteins, and oxidation-reduction. The proteins that the most significantly contributed to leaf color variation were photosynthetic proteins of PSII and PSI, which directly related to photooxidation and determined the photosynthetic performance of photosystem. Further analysis demonstrated that low jasmonic acid content was needed to golden-yellow leaf GL1. These findings lay a solid foundation for future studies into the molecular mechanisms that underlie leaf color formation of GL1.
   Biological significance: The natural bud mutant GL1 of L. indica is an example through changing leaf color to cope with complex environment. However, the molecular mechanism of leaf color variation are largely elusive. The proteins with different abundance identified from a label-free comparative proteomics revealed a range of biological processes associated with leaf color variation, including photosynthesis, oxidation-reduction and jasmonic acid signaling. The photooxidation and low level of jasmonic acid played a primary role in GL1 adaptation in golden-yellow leaf. These findings provide possible pathway or signal for the molecular mechanism associated with leaf color formation and as a valuable resource for signal transaction of chloroplast.

AB  - Objectives: The metabolism of cells in inflammatory and noninflammatory arthritic joint diseases is subject to complex environmental controls. The aim of the present study was to investigate the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), and antioxidant enzyme activities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA).
   Design and methods: Plasma levels of TAC, malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of some erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes, as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) were estimated in patients with RA and OA and compared with controls.
   Results: The plasma TAC levels were significantly lower in the RA group than the OA and control group (P < 0.05). Plasma MDA concentrations were significantly higher in patients with RA than those with OA and healthy subjects (P < 0.05). Erythrocyte GSH-Px and CAT activities were found to be significantly lower in patients with RA than those with OA and healthy subjects (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in erythrocyte SOD activities between the groups (P > 0.05). ESR were significantly higher in RA patients than in healthy subjects and patients with OA (P < 0.01). Moreover, there were significant negative correlations between TAC vs. MDA, ESR vs. TAC, and a positive correlation between ESR vs. MDA in the RA group (r = -0.398, P < 0.05; r = -0.422, P < 0.05; r = 0.530, P < 0.05, respectively).
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that levels of LPO are increased in patients with RA compared to patients with OA. In addition, plasma TAC levels are decreased in RA due to its inflammatory character. We conclude that detecting plasma TAC levels with this novel method may be used as a routine and rapid test to verify the levels of oxidative stress in RA. Furthermore, correlating TAC and LPO levels with acute phase reactants such as ESR may give some clues about disease activity in RA. (0 2005 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

AB  - The discovery of trauma as an aetiological factor in mental dissociation is more than a century old, but neurobiological research in the last decade has started to clarify a neurobiological basis that may shed light on the complex symptomatology observed in traumatized children. Dysfunctional stress responses, emotional-based style of functioning, hyperarousal, anxiety, irritability, impulsivity, disengaged attention and educational underachievement may thus begin to be better understood. The aim of this overview is to give an update on the concept of dissociation and the links to new neurobiological findings, hopefully to reduce unawareness, wrong diagnostics or even neglect of dissociative symptomatology by clinicians in child and adolescents psychiatry in the Nordic countries. A systematic overview of studies of mental dissociation in children and adolescents published over the last decade disclosed a total of 1019 references; 309 papers regarding the concept of dissociation, memory, trauma and the neurobiological correlates were studied in detail. The assumption of a trauma-genic basis of dissociation is still most discussed in the literature. The importance of other childhood trauma in addition to sexual abuse is outlined, focusing on childhood interpersonal trauma. Recent research on traumatized children and adolescents has demonstrated some permanent neurochemical as well as functional and structural abnormalities in brain areas that are involved in the integrative process of cognition and memory. This research begins to clarify the cerebral basis and mechanisms for the trauma-related dissociation observed in dissociative ( conversion) disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) and somatoform disorders. New perspectives on the nature of subcortical processes linking the phenomena of dissociation and traumatic experiences may have important implications for the understanding of dissociative symptoms in children and adolescents. They may be regarded as complex environmentally induced developmental disorders, supporting the view that PTSD and somatization disorders may be specific forms of dissociative processes to be categorized together with dissociative ( conversion) disorders as "trauma-related dissociative disorders".

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder is a disorder with an identifiable etiological factor (exposure to a traumatic event) and with a complex symptomatology (ie intrusive memories, avoidance, hyperarousal) that suggests dysfunction in multiple psychobiological systems. This review considers studies of the neurobiological consequences of acute and chronic stress showing that traumatic experiences can produce long-lasting alterations in multiple neurochemical systems. The role of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system, prefrontal cortex dopaminergic system, endogenous opiates, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and cortico-releasing factors are reviewed. Several models of PTSD are highlighted, including fear conditioning, kindling, and sensitization. In particular, fear conditioning to explicit and contextual cues is proposed as a model for intrusive memories reactivated by trauma-related stimuli and hyperarousal, respectively. It is argued that the amygdala plays a crucial role in the encoding and retrieval of fear memories activated by specific stimuli that have been associated with aversive events, Association involving more complex environmental stimuli and aversive events may require the involvement of the hippocampus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Repeated activation of conditioned fear memories may produce a kindling-like process which results in spontaneous intrusive memories.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Multi-unowned-cat environments can be highly stressful for cats, and infectious and parasite diseases spread quickly and are difficult to prevent. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of intestinal parasites and fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) in cat feces collected from different multi-cat environments and assess the effect of housing conditions on intestinal parasites and FCM levels in order to develop more efficient control strategies. Cat fecal samples from rescue shelters, catteries and feline colonies were analyzed with coprological methods to detect intestinal parasite patency and determine FCM. Helminth infection was mainly detected in free-roaming cats. In confined cats, protozoa infections were more likely detected in shelter cats than in cattery cats. Exposure to dogs was associated with parasite infection and cats highly exposed to dogs with visual contact and audible barking showed higher intestinal protozoa prevalence than cats that were not exposed to dogs. FCM levels were correlated with enclosure size and protozoa infection. Reducing stress by improving housing in terms of enclosure size and avoiding exposure to dogs may have an impact on the occurrence of intestinal parasites, especially protozoa.
   Housing conditions were assessed in different unowned multi-cat management models in order to evaluate their impact on the occurrence of intestinal parasites and fecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) levels. Fresh stool fecal samples were collected from rescue shelters, catteries and feline colonies for coprological analyses in order to detect intestinal parasite patency and fecal cortisol metabolites. A questionnaire provided information about the facilities, management and housing conditions of cats, including information about dog exposure, enclosure size, environment enrichment and changes to group composition. Overall, intestinal parasite infection was detected in 58.2% of fecal samples collected. The occurrence of intestinal parasites detected in free-roaming cats was 82.2%, mainly due to helminth infection. The parasite infection rate was 57.3% in rescue shelters and 34.6% in catteries. In confined cats, protozoa infection was more likely detected in rescue shelters than in catteries (RR = 2.02 (1.30-3.14), p = 0.0012). Although the FCM values were very variable between cats, the enclosure size and parasite infection were correlated with the average FCM. A small enclosure size was correlated with high fecal cortisol metabolites (p = 0.016). Protozoa-positive samples showed higher FCM levels than negative samples (p = 0.0150). High dog exposure was statistically associated with protozoa infection (p = 0.0006). The results indicated that improving housing, especially in terms of floor space and avoiding dog exposure, reduces stress and can thus be applied to make control strategies in multi-unowned-cat environments more efficient, especially when cats are confined.

AB  - The presence of phenotypic behavioral correlations and their connection to fitness consequences of organisms have received considerable debate within the literature. Yet, little work has been carried out to connect any behavioral correlates found within a set of laboratory studies to natural behavior observed under complex environmental conditions. To help fill this gap, individual crayfish, collected from the same local population, completed five different behavioral assays in a laboratory setting in a random order. These data were used to reveal any possible correlations for behavioral scores across all of the laboratory tests. Subsequently, these same individuals were placed into the field and video recorded for 24hr. A separate set of field behaviors, related to the laboratory assays, were quantified from the field videos. The normalized laboratory and field behaviors were used in three stepwise statistical analyses. First, normalized data were loaded into a PCA to generate a priori hypotheses on potential behavioral correlates. These hypotheses were subsequently tested using general multiple linear regression. Finally, structural equation modeling was performed to elucidate any behavioral modules from the laboratory assays that correlated with behavioral patterns present from the fieldwork. Three laboratory-based behavioral modules were connected to three separate field assays: exploration-avoidance, bold-shy, and aggressiveness. Yet, some behaviors exhibited in the laboratory assays were uncorrelated with any behaviors found in the field and vice versa. Results from this study provide evidence that although many different behavioral correlates may exist within laboratory settings, these same modules may not translate directly into predicting behavior under natural settings.

AB  - Sexual conflict is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and often involves costly sexual harassment of females by males. An overlooked outcome of sexual conflict is its potential impact on social behaviour. Due to their seemingly harmful mode of copulation (traumatic insemination) and tendency to form aggregations, bed bugs are an ideal model for studying the social implications of sexual conflict. Repeated traumatic inseminations are known to reduce some aspects of female fitness, so we expected the benefits to males and the high costs for females of frequent mating to result in divergent social preferences between the sexes. To examine the impact of sexual harassment on social structure, we devised a novel experimental arena with either two shelters or 12 shelters and continuously tracked sexual and social interactions between individually marked bed bugs over 6 days. By constructing aggregation networks, we examined whether female bed bugs occupied more peripheral network positions compared to males as well as whether females preferentially associated with other females as a strategy to reap the benefits of group living while mitigating the costs of unsolicited sexual attention. We found no evidence that females shape their social environment to evade associating with males. However, when tested indi-vidually in a follow-up experiment, mated females showed a strong preference for social cues from females over social cues from males. Our results therefore suggest that males and females may be in conflict over the composition of social associations and highlight the importance of both examining behaviour at the individual level and tracking larger groups of freely interacting populations in more complex environments.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Efficient extractions of trace antibiotic residues in the environment are a key factor for accurate quantification of the residues. A new nanoporous material, namely, magnetically covalent organic polymer (MCOP, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-COP) was synthesized in this work and was used for magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE). The combination of MSPE with high-performance liquid chromatography separation together with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) was established as an effective method for the determination of four sulfonamide (SA) residues in surface water surrounding a cattle farm. The synthesized magnetic material was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, magnetic properties measurement system (MPMS), and nitrogen gas porosimetry. The material possessed many attractive features, such as a unique microporous structure, a larger specific surface area (137.93 m(2) s(-1)) than bare Fe3O4 (24.84 m(2)s(-1)), high saturation magnetization (50.5 emu.g(-1)), open adsorption sites, and high stability. The influencing parameters, including pH, the used amount of MCOPs, the type of eluent, adsorption solution, and desorption time, were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the method conferred good linearity ranges (R-2 >= 0.9990), low detection limits (S/N = 3, LOD, 0.10-0.25 mu g.L-1), and satisfactory recoveries (79.7% to 92.2%). The enrichment factor (EF) for the four SAs was 34.13-38.86. The relative standard deviations of intraday (n = 5) and of interday (n = 3) were less than 4.8% and 8.9%, respectively. The equilibria between extraction and desorption for SAs could be reached within 150 s. The proposed method was sensitive and convenient for detecting SA residues in complex environmental matrices, and the successful application of the new MCOPs as an adsorbent was demonstrated.

AB  - Pigs reared in intensive farming systems are more likely to develop damaging behaviours such as tail and ear biting (EB) due to their difficulty in coping with the environment and their inability to perform natural behaviours. However, much less is known about the aetiology of EB behaviour compared to tail biting behaviour. Application of new intervention strategies may be the key to deal with this welfare issue. The discipline of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) allows farmers to improve their management practices with the use of advanced technologies. Exploring the behaviour is the first step to identify reliable indicators for the development of such a tool. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an ethogram of biter and bitten pigs during an EB event and to find potential features for the development of a tool that can monitor EB events automatically and continuously. The observational study was carried out on a 300 sow farrow-to-finish commercial farm in Ireland (Co. Cork) during the first and second weaner stages. Three pens per stage holding c. 35 pigs each, six pens in total, were video recorded and 2.2 h of videos per pen were selected for video analysis. Two ethograms were developed, one for the biter and one for the bitten pig, to describe their behavioural repertoire. Behaviours were audio-visually labelled using ELAN and afterwards the resulting labels were processed using MATLAB 2014. For the video data, duration and frequency of the observed behavioural interactions were quantified. Six behaviours were identified for the biter pig and a total of 710 interactions were observed: chewing (215 cases), quick bite (138 cases), pulling ear (97 cases), shaking head (11 cases), gentle manipulation (129 cases) and attempt to EB (93 cases). When the behaviour observed was not certain, it was classified as doubt (27 cases). Seven behaviours were identified for the bitten pig in response to the biters behaviour and were divided in: four non-vocal behaviours described as biting (40 cases), head knocking (209 cases), shaking/moving head (225 cases) or moving away (156 cases); and three vocal behaviours identified as scream (74 cases), grunt (166 cases), and squeal (125 cases). Vocal behaviours were classified using a verified set of features yielding a precision of 83.2%. A significant difference in duration was found between all the behaviours (P < 0.001), except between gentle manipulation and chewing where no difference in duration was found (P < 0.338). The results illustrate the heterogeneity of EB behaviours, which may be used to better understand this poorly studied damaging behaviour. They also indicate potential for the development of a PLF tool to automatically, continuously monitor such behaviour on farm by combining the behaviour of the biter pig and the bitten pigs responses.

AB  - Like other animals, C. elegans nematodes have the ability to socially interact and to communicate through exchange and sensing of small soluble signaling compounds that help them cope with complex environmental conditions. For the time being, worm biocommunication assays are being performed mainly on agar plates; however, microfluidic assays may provide significant advantages compared to traditional methods, such as control of signaling molecule concentrations and gradients or confinement of distinct worm populations in different microcompartments. Here, we propose a microfluidic device for studying signaling via diffusive secreted compounds between two specific C. elegans populations over prolonged durations. In particular, we designed a microfluidic assay to investigate the biological process of maleinduced demise, i.e. lifespan shortening and accelerated age-related phenotype alterations, in C. elegans hermaphrodites in the presence of a physically separated male population. For this purpose, male and hermaphrodite worm populations were confined in adjacent microchambers on the chip, whereas molecules secreted by males could be exchanged between both populations by periodically activating the controlled fluidic transfer of mu l-volume aliquots of male-conditioned medium. For male-conditioned hermaphrodites, we observed a reduction of 4 days in mean lifespan compared to the non-conditioned on-chip culture. We also observed an enhanced muscle decline, as expressed by a faster decrease in the thrashing frequency and the appearance of vacuolar-like structures indicative of accelerated aging. The chip was placed in an incubator at 20 degrees C for accurate control of the lifespan assay conditions. An on-demand bacteria feeding protocol was applied, and the worms were observed during long-term on-chip culture over the whole worm lifespan.

AB  - The acute effects of alcohol administration are age-, dose-, time-and task-dependent. Although generally considered to be a sedative drug, alcohol has both stimulatory and depressant effects on behavior, depending on dose and time. Alcohol-induced motor activating effects are consistently shown in mice but rarely demonstrated in adult, outbred rats using conventional behavioral tests. The aim of the present experiment was to study acute alcohol-induced effects on behavioral profiles in a more complex environment using the novel multivariate concentric square field(TM) (MCSF) test, designed for assessing different behaviors in the same trial including locomotor activity. Adult male Wistar rats (Sca:Wl) were administered one intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of alcohol (0.0 g/kg, 0.5 g/kg, 1.0 g/kg, or 1.5 g/kg) 5 min prior to the 30-min MCSF test. The two highest doses induced marked motor-suppressing effects. A significant interaction between group and time was found in general activity when comparing rats exposed to alcohol at 0.0 g/kg and 0.5 g/kg. In contrast to the 0.0 g/kg dose that increased the activity over time, animals administered the low dose (0.5 g/kg) demonstrated an initial high activity followed by a decline over time. No indications for acute alcohol-induced anxiolytic-like effects were found. The multivariate setting in the MCSF test appears to be sensitive for detecting motor-activating effects of low doses of alcohol as well as reduced locomotion at doses lower than in other behavioral tasks. The detection of subtle changes in behavior across time and dose is important for understanding alcohol induced effects. This approach may be useful in evaluating alcohol doses that correspond to different degrees of intoxication in humans. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Entrainment of circadian rhythms (CR) to the light dark cycle has been well described under controlled, experimental conditions. However, studies in rodents have reported that rhythms in the laboratory are not always reproduced under field conditions. The aim of this study was to characterise the CR of sheep maintained under conditions of standard UK farm animal husbandry and to investigate the effects of environmental challenges presented by season, weaning and changes in housing on CR. Male sheep (n = 9) were kept at pasture, or group housed in barns, under natural photoperiod for one year. CR in locomotor activity were monitored using accelerometry, and 24 h patterns in plasma cortisol and melatonin were measured every 4 h by ELISA. CR was measured before and after weaning, in summer and winter, and at pasture and by barn housing. Cosinor analysis revealed high amplitude, diurnal rhythms in locomotor activity that were disrupted by weaning and by barn housing. Rhythms in winter showed an interrupted night time activity pattern, but only when the sheep were kept at pasture. Cortisol and melatonin secretion followed typical circadian patterns in winter and summer. The CR of the sheep under the field conditions of this study were strikingly robust under basal conditions, but easily disrupted by environmental challenges. Interrupted patterns of activity during the long nights of wintertime, not previously reported for sheep kept in experimental conditions were recorded. Based on these findings, we propose that animals require exposure to more complex environments than the laboratory in order to exhibit their true circadian phenotype.

AB  - Laboratory rats are usually kept in relatively small cages, but research has shown that they prefer larger and more complex environments. The physiological, neurological and health effects of standard laboratory housing are well established, but fewer studies have addressed the sustained emotional impact of a standard cage environment. One method of assessing affective states in animals is to look at the animals' anticipatory behaviour between the presentation of a cue signalling the arrival of a reward and the arrival of that reward. The primary aim of this study was to use anticipatory behaviour to assess the affective state experienced by female rats a) reared and housed long-term in a standard laboratory cage versus a semi-naturalistic environment, and b) before and after treatment with an antidepressant or an anxiolytic. A secondary aim was to add to the literature on anticipatory behaviour by describing and comparing the frequency and duration of individual elements of anticipatory behaviour displayed by rats reared in these two systems. In all experiments, total behavioural frequency was higher in standard-housed rats compared to rats from the semi-naturalistic condition, suggesting that standard-housed rats were more sensitive to rewards and experiencing poorer welfare than rats reared in the semi-naturalistic environment. What rats did in anticipation of the reward also differed between housing treatments, with standard-housed rats mostly rearing and rats from the semi-naturalistic condition mostly sitting facing the direction of the upcoming treat. Drug interventions had no effect on the quantity or form of anticipatory behaviour, suggesting that the poorer welfare experienced by standard-housed rats was not analogous to depression or anxiety, or alternatively that the drug interventions were ineffective. This study adds to mounting evidence that standard laboratory housing for rats compromises rat welfare, and provides further scientific support for recommendations that current minimum standards be raised.

AB  - Fish can be exposed to a variety of neuroactive pharmaceuticals via the effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants and concerns have arisen regarding their potential impacts on fish behaviour and ecology. In this study, we investigated the uptake of 14 neuroactive pharmaceuticals from a treated wastewater effluent into blood plasma and brain regions of roach (Rutilus rutilus) after exposure for 15 days. We show that a complex mixture of pharmaceuticals including, 6 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, 3 atypical antipsychotics, 2 tricyclic antidepressants and a benzodiazepine, concentrate in different regions of the brain including the telencephalon, hypothalamus, optic tectum and hindbrain of effluent-exposed fish. Pharmaceuticals, with the exception of nordiazepam, were between 3-40 fold higher in brain compared with blood plasma, showing these neuroactive drugs are readily uptaken, into brain tissues in fish. To assess for the potential for any adverse ecotoxicological effects, the effect ratio was calculated from human therapeutic plasma concentrations (HtPCs) and the measured or predicted fish plasma concentrations of pharmaceuticals. After accounting for a safety factor of 1000, the effect ratios indicated that fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, sertraline, and amitriptyline warrant prioritisation for risk assessment studies. Furthermore, although plasma concentrations of all the pharmaceuticals were between 33 and 5714-fold below HtPCs, alterations in serotonin, glutamate, acetylcholine and tryptophan concentrations were observed in different brain regions of effluent-exposed fish. This study highlights the importance of determining the potential health effects arising from the concentration of complex environmental mixtures in risk assessment studies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary When environments rapidly change, animals must respond through adjustments in their behaviour and cognition, which are largely controlled by physiological processes. In particular, glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone, are important adrenocortical hormones facilitating behavioural and cognitive adjustments. However, we know relatively little about how adrenocortical activity affects problem solving in animals. We therefore studied whether adrenocortical activity was related to problem solving in a native Australian rodent, the fawn-footed mosaic-tailed rat (Melomys cervinipes). We collected faecal samples and measured glucocorticoid metabolite hormone concentrations as a measure of adrenocortical activity using an enzyme immunoassay. Corticosterone metabolite concentrations were then compared to problem solving measured using five food-baited puzzles and one escape-motivated puzzle. Interestingly, adrenocortical activity was not related to how quickly problems were solved, or how much the rats interacted with the problems. However, given that adrenocortical activity is involved in multiple processes, future studies should also compare behaviour to other physiological measures. Animals can respond physiologically, such as by adjusting glucocorticoid hormone concentrations, to sudden environmental challenges. These physiological changes can then affect behavioural and cognitive responses. While the relationships between adrenocortical activity and behaviour and cognition are well documented, results are equivocal, suggesting species-specific responses. We investigated whether adrenocortical activity, measured using corticosterone metabolite concentration, was related to problem solving in an Australian rodent, the fawn-footed mosaic-tailed rat (Melomys cervinipes). Mosaic-tailed rats live in complex environments that are prone to disturbance, suggesting a potential need to solve novel problems, and have been found to show relationships between physiology and other behaviours. We measured problem solving using five food-baited puzzles (matchbox and cylinder in the home cage, and activity board with pillars to push, tiles to slide and levers to lift in an open field), and an escape-motivated obstruction task in a light/dark box. Faecal samples were collected from individuals during routine cage cleaning. Adrenocortical activity was evaluated non-invasively by measuring faecal corticosterone metabolites using an enzyme immunoassay, which was biochemically and biologically validated. Despite varying over time, adrenocortical activity was not significantly related to problem solving success or time spent interacting for any task. However, as adrenocortical activity is reflective of multiple physiological processes, including stress and metabolism, future studies should consider how other measures of physiology are also linked to problem solving.

AB  - Here we discuss the role of diverse environmental manipulations affecting cognition with special regard to psychiatric conditions. We present evidence supporting a direct causal correlation between the valence of the environmental stimulation and some psychopathological traits and how the environment influences brain structure and function with special regard to oxidative stress and mitochondrial activity. Increasing experimental evidence supports a role for mitochondrial dysfunctions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Brain mitochondria are considered crucial mediators of allostasis, that is the capability to adapt to stress via a complex interaction between the autonomic, metabolic, and immune systems to maintain cellular homeostasis. In this process, mitochondria act as highly dynamic integrators by sensing and transducing stressors into adaptation mechanisms via metabolic stress mediators, such as glucocorticoids and catecholamines. Alterations in cellular homeostasis induced by chronic stress are thought to predispose to disease by triggering the so-called "mitochondrial allo-static load". This process is characterized by functional and structural changes of the mitochondria, ultimately leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial DNA damage and apoptosis. In this review we discuss the role of diverse environmental manipulations to affect cognition with special regard to psychiatric conditions. How the environment influences brain structure and function, and the interactions between rearing conditions, oxidative stress and mitochondrial activity are fundamental questions that are still poorly understood. As will be discussed, increasing experimental evidence supports a role for mitochondrial dysfunctions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Brain mitochondria are considered crucial mediators of allostasis, that is the capability to adapt to stress via a complex interaction between the autonomic, metabolic, and immune systems to maintain cellular homeostasis. In this process, mitochondria act as highly dynamic integrators by sensing and transducing stressors into adaptation mechanisms via metabolic stress mediators, such as glucocorticoids and catecholamines. Alter-ations in cellular homeostasis induced by chronic stress are thought to predispose to disease by triggering the so-called "mitochondrial allostatic load". This process is characterized by functional and structural changes of the mitochondria, ultimately leading to oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial DNA damage and apoptosis. The brain requires considerable mitochondrial reserve not only to sustain basal neuronal needs but also to provide increasing energy demands during stress. Consistently with these high energetic requirements, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the brain is particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial defects. Thus, even subtle metabolic alterations might have a substantial impact on cognitive functions. Over the last decade, several experimental evidence supported the hypothesis that a suboptimal mitochondrial function, which could be of genetic origin or acquired following adverse life events, is a key vulnerability factor for stress-related psycho -pathologies. Chronic psychological stress is a major promoter of anxiety as well as of oxidative damage, as shown in several studies. Recent evidence from mouse models harbouring mutations in mitochondrial genes demon-strated the role of mitochondria in modulating the response to acute psychological stress.
   However, it has yet to be determined whether mitochondrial dysfunctions are the cause or the consequence of anxiety. In this review, we discuss how adverse psychosocial environments can impact mitochondrial bioenergetics at the molecular level and we gather evidence from several studies linking energy metabolism and stress resilience/vulnerability. Moreover, we review recent findings supporting that metabolic dysfunction can underlie deficits in complex social behaviours. As will be discussed, aberrations in mitochondrial functionality have been found in the nucleus accumbens of highly anxious mice and mediate low social competitiveness. In addition, alterations in sociability can be reversed by enhancing mitochondrial functions. Recent evidence also demonstrated that a specific mu-tation in mitochondrial DNA, previously linked to autism spectrum disorder, produces autistic endophenotypes in mice by altering respiration chain and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Finally, we discuss a "Negative Enrichment" model that can explain some of the psychopathological conditions relevant to humans. Evidence of a direct causal correlation of valence of environmental stimulation and psychopathological traits will be presented, and possible molecular mechanisms that focus on oxidative stress. Collectively, the findings described here have been achieved with a wide set of behavioural and cognitive tasks with translational validity. Thus, they will be useful for future work aimed to elucidate the fine metabolic alterations in psychopathologies and devise novel approaches targeting mitochondria to alleviate these conditions.

AB  - Previous work has shown that herbivores successfully learn to associate food sensory characteristics with postingestive consequences when the conditioning procedure is simple, whereas this ability breaks down when the learning task is made more complex. We hypothesized that sensory characteristics could act as indicators of postingestive consequences and that the presence of preingestive cues would improve the food learning of sheep in situations varying in complexity. Sixteen sheep were subjected to a first conditioning phase to associate 2 flavors added to alfalfa hay with either a positive or a negative consequence, induced by intraruminal administration of starch (330 mg/g of DMI) or LiCl (5 mg/g of DMI). Sheep progressively decreased their choice of the flavored hay associated with the negative consequence (P < 0.05). This procedure provided sheep with experience with postingestive consequences associated with the different flavors. In a second conditioning phase, the experienced sheep and 16 naive sheep were divided into groups of 8 and subjected to either a simple or a complex conditioning procedure [i.e., the 2 flavors were offered on separate days (simple conditioning) or simultaneously within a day (complex conditioning)]. The 2 flavors applied to grass hay were associated with either positive (starch, 330 mg/g of DMI) or negative (LiCl, 10 mg/g of DMI) consequences. As hypothesized, sheep in the simple conditioning group expressed a greater aversion to the flavored hay associated with the negative consequence than did those in the complex conditioning group (0.303 +/- 0.035 vs. 0.474 +/- 0.035 respectively; P < 0.01). Experienced sheep rejected the flavor associated with the negative consequence more strongly than did naive sheep, regardless of the conditioning procedure (0.304 +/- 0.029 vs. 0.470 +/- 0.041 respectively; P < 0.05). The initial increased preference for aniseed (0.80 +/- 0.04), however, greatly influenced food learning because sheep negatively conditioned on this flavor expressed less avoidance than those negatively conditioned on orange (0.53 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.03 respectively; P < 0.01). In conclusion, the simultaneous scenario was actually perceived as complex by all sheep, and experienced sheep were more efficient in food learning than naive sheep in both the simple and complex learning contexts. The sheep were thus able to generalize the association between sensory cues and postingestive consequences, especially in a complex environment, and then to use these sensory cues as indicators of postingestive consequences.

AB  - Simple Summary Early life experiences such as contact with humans, maternal care and the physical environment can play a substantial role in shaping behavioural and physiological responses to stress. This experiment studied the effects of lactation housing systems and human interaction on stress in young pigs. We hypothesised that piglets handled in a positive manner and reared in loose farrowing and lactation pens with increased opportunity for interaction with their dam, greater space and more complexity in their physical environment have improved stress resilience than piglets reared in traditional farrowing crates with routine contact from stockpeople. In both housing systems, providing regular opportunities for positive human interaction reduced piglets' fear of humans and routine husbandry procedures imposed by humans, and reduced the number of injuries obtained after weaning. However, contrary to the expected findings, piglets from loose farrowing and lactation pens were more reactive to capture by a stockperson, more fearful of novel and human stimuli, had more injuries during the lactation period and were more likely to perform behaviours which may be indicative of reduced coping after weaning. Whether these effects are specific to the loose farrowing and lactation system studied in this experiment or are reflective of other loose systems requires further research. This experiment studied the effects of lactation housing systems and human interaction on piglets' responses to routine stressors. Forty litters of piglets were reared in either a standard farrowing crate (FC) or a loose farrowing and lactation pen (LP; PigSAFE pen) and received either routine contact with humans (C) or regular opportunities for positive human contact (+HC; 3 min of patting, stroking and scratching 5 times/week). Behavioural and physiological responses to routine husbandry procedures, weaning, novelty and humans were studied in addition to effects on piglet growth, injuries and survival. Compared to C piglets, +HC piglets vocalised for shorter durations (p = 0.018) during husbandry procedures and showed a lower intensity of escape behaviour during iron injection (p = 0.042) and oral vaccination (p = 0.026) at 3 d of age, capture at 2 wk of age (p < 0.001), and intramuscular vaccination (p = 0.005) at 3 wk of age. +HC piglets at 2 wk of age were faster than C piglets to approach (p = 0.048) and interact (p = 0.042) with a stationary unfamiliar human. Compared to LP piglets, FC piglets showed a lower intensity of escape behaviour during capture and iron administration by a stockperson at 3 d of age (p = 0.043). FC piglets at 2 wk of age were faster than LP piglets to approach (p = 0.005) and interact (p = 0.027) with a novel object and approach (p = 0.009) and interact (p = 0.008) with an unfamiliar human. FC piglets had fewer injuries than LP piglets at 2 wk of age (p = 0.004). +HC pigs had fewer injuries than C pigs after weaning (p = 0.003). After weaning there were more pigs from LP than FC observed to be upright (both stationary, p = 0.002 and walking, p = 0.024), vocalizing (p = 0.004), nosing another pig (p = 0.035) and nosing the pen floor (p = 0.038). There were no significant effects on neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios or plasma cortisol concentrations 1.5 h after weaning. However, 25 h after weaning +HC pigs had higher haptoglobin concentrations than C pigs (p = 0.002), and C/LP pigs had higher cortisol concentrations than +HC/LP and C/FC pigs (p = 0.012).
   There were no significant effects on piglet growth, the number of piglets born alive or the number stillborn, however there were more piglets weaned from FC than LP (p = 0.035). The results from this experiment raise questions that require further research on the ability of pigs reared in loose pens to cope with stressors such as exposure to humans, novelty, husbandry procedures and weaning. This experiment also provides evidence that regular positive human interaction reduces pigs' fear of humans and husbandry procedures imposed by stockpeople. More research is required to determine if any of these effects are sustained long-term.

AB  - Coastal geomorphic classification identifying the type of depositional environment, is an important indicator for coastal state and vulnerability, e.g., beach, bedrock and wetland (tidal flat and estuarine/delta/back-barrier depression). Accurate and current maps of these geomorphology classes from local (100 m(-1) km) to global (105 km) scales are important for a range of objectives in the coastal zone. Previous methods to create coastal geomorphic maps relied heavily on manual efforts and expert opinions. However, these approaches are labour intensive and impractical for consistent application at a global scale, while still including local details. Existing global coastal geomorphology datasets are a compilation of different local-scale datasets, with varying spatial, categorical resolutions and accuracies. The recent availability of "big " and "open " data as well as increased processing capabilities resulted in the use of satellite images and digital elevation models to identify sandy beach and cliff separately. In our work, these raster data were processed on Google Earth Engine, combined with shape descriptors of coastline vectors and then fitted into machine learning models to classify the intertidal coastal geomorphology into bedrock, beach or wetland classes on the global scale (from 56 S to 60 N, excluding coral reef/fringing reef and fjord dominated coasts). A unique attribute of this new method was the incorporation of shape descriptors extracted from shoreline vector data, which substantially improved the classification accuracy. Using existing data from European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and Australia for training and testing, the model achieved averaged 85% accuracy for testing datasets in these continents and 84% accuracy for 10,000 independent global validation samples beyond these continents. Successful classification was achieved for coasts dominated by a single geomorphology class, as well as more complex environments, such as headland bay and barrier island systems, where multiple classes appear next to each other. The model had relatively less confidence in coasts with sandy cliffs, tall canopy cover and engineered structures. Complete statistics from this study covering 56 S to 60 N showed 36.8% (142,845 km) wetland, 26.7% (103,762 km) beach and 36.5% (141,579 km) bedrock. Beach and bedrock geomorphic classes were commonly detected at mid-latitudes (30o to 60o N/S), while wetland dominated tropical latitudes (0o to 30o N/S). The output dataset can be used for different coastal management purposes. The accuracy and categorical resolution of the classification can be further improved with the development of Earth Observation Big Data in the future.

AB  - Laboratory mice (Mus musculus) are typically housed in simple cages consisting of one open space. These standard cages may thwart mouse ability to segregate resting areas from areas where they eliminate, a behaviour that is prevalent across the animal kingdom. No scientific work has directly tested whether mice engage in such segregation behaviour, or whether the ability to do so may have welfare consequences. Here we show that mice, whether housed in standard cages or a complex housing system consisting of three interconnected standard cages, kept nesting and elimination sites highly segregated, with nest and urine co-occurring in the same location only 2% of the time. However, mice in the complex system established these clean and dirty sites in separate cages instead of separate locations within one cage, and carried bedding materials (cellulose pellets) from their nesting cages to their latrine cage. Moreover, mice in the complex system displayed more behaviours associated with positive welfare and were less disturbed by weekly husbandry procedures. We conclude that mice find waste products aversive, and that housing mice in a way that facilitates spatial segregation provides a simple way of allowing the expression of natural behaviours and improving welfare.
