AB  - It has been demonstrated that the complex sensorimotor and social stimulation achieved by rearing animals in an enriched environment (EE) can reinstate juvenile-like plasticity in the adult cortex. However, it is not known whether EE can affect thalamocortical transmission. In the first part of this work, I investigated this problem by recording in vivo field potentials from the visual cortex evoked by electrical stimulation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in anaesthetized rats. I found that a period of EE during adulthood shifted the input-output curves and increased paired-pulse depression, suggesting an enhanced synaptic strength at thalamocortical terminals. Accordingly, EE animals showed an increased expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT-2) in geniculocortical afferents to layer IV. Rats reared in EE also showed an enhancement of thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) triggered by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of the dLGN. To monitor the functional consequences of increased LTP in EE rats, I recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) before and after application of TBS to the geniculocortical pathway. I found that responses to visual stimulation were enhanced across a range of contrasts in EE animals. This was accompanied by an upregulation of the intracortical excitatory synaptic marker vGluT-1 and a decrease in the expression of the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT), indicating a shift in the excitation/inhibition ratio. Thus, in the adult rat, EE enhances synaptic strength and plasticity of the thalamocortical pathway associated with specific changes in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Another interesting problem connected to EE, is the possibility that the multimodal sensory stimulation provided by this rearing protocol can affect functional relationships among different cortical areas, thus contributing to the effect observed on visual cortical plasticity. In the second part of my work, I explored this problem by looking for cortical areas ...

AB  - Increased attention has been directed towards determining how environment interacts with genetics on the manifestation of stress-related disorders. This study investigates the differential effects of an enriched versus impoverished environment on behavioral and biochemical endpoints of depression between stress-vulnerable and stress-resilient strains in the chick anxiety-depression model. Black Australorp and Production Red strains were housed in either enriched or impoverished conditions for 4 days and then socially isolated for 90 min. Rate of distress vocalizations (DVocs) were recorded throughout the isolation period and latency to behavioral despair was calculated. Immediately following testing, bilateral hippocampal tissue was harvested and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were analyzed via an ELISA assay. A no-test group of chicks removed directly from the home cage was used as a control. Regardless of housing conditions, stress-vulnerable Black Australorps entered behavioral despair more quickly than the Production Reds. Significant decreases in BDNF were seen as a result of an isolation stressor, but were dependent on the complex interaction of genetic line and housing stress conditions. Decreases were only detected in Black Australorps housed in impoverished conditions and the Production Red housed in enriched conditions, a finding we explain in terms of differences between predictable, mild stress and an acute stressor. Because of the nuanced nature of current research regarding the effects of both acute and mild stress, we urge researchers to begin to develop methods to integrate both differing genetic predispositions to stress as well as differences in environmental modifiers.

AB  - Excessive fear is a hallmark of various anxiety and stress disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current pre-clinical research has focused on identifying behavioral and neuropharmacological methods of facilitating fear extinction in order to improve well-being of PTSD patients. The present experiment investigated the effects of voluntary exercise on fear memory and object recognition memory in male C57BL/6J mice. Results suggested that mice that exercised voluntarily exhibited significantly less fear-elicited freezing behavior during cued fear extinction trials compared to that of non-exercise control mice. Results from assessment of object memory revealed no difference in object memory retention between voluntary exercise mice and control mice. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of exercise in mice appear to be specific to the task and to the specific memory process. These results suggest that voluntary exercise may hold utility for remediation of PTSD and anxiety symptoms in humans. ; Includes bibliography. ; Thesis (B.A.)--Florida Atlantic University, Harriet L.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis is limited to specific niches in the brain: the dentate gyrus (DG) and the subventricular zone (SVZ). The proliferation potential of these neural stem cells is plastic and responds to environmental manipulations. It has previously been shown that short-term environmental enrichment is sufficient to increase the proliferation of the GFAP+ stem cells in the DG of juvenile mice in vivo (Salmaso, 2012). Using male C57 wild-type mice, we examined the potential of SVZ and DG NSCs in vitro following short-term enrichment using neurosphere assays in both juvenile and adult mice. We also examined the effect of enrichment on cognitive abilities such as learning and memory as well as anxiety behaviour. As expected, we saw a trend that indicated that enrichment increased NSC proliferation in the SVZ in juvenile but not adult mice. We also observed an effect of enrichment on the cognitive abilities of both age groups.

AB  - Animals are exploited by man for several different purposes. According to many, society should be concerned about the welfare of these animals. Currently, an increasing need exists to be able to assess and improve animal welfare. In this thesis a concept of welfare is applied that states that 'welfare is determined by the balance between positive and negative experiences'. This definition implies that an interaction exists between stress- and reward systems in the brain and that negative experiences can be compensated by positive experiences. This thesis describes a study that investigates whether the spontaneous behavioural response that animals display when they expect a reward (anticipatory behaviour) can be used as a welfare indicator. This concept is based on existing knowledge about the influence of previous experiences such as stress on the sensitivity for rewards in both man and animals. The response (i.e. sensitivity) to rewards can therefore be indicative of previous experiences and may therefore be a tool to assess the state of an animal in terms of welfare. In this study the rat is used as a model and reward-sensitivity is determined by anticipatory behaviour which is evoked in this animal by classical conditioning. This means that through regular pairings of a stimulus (sound and/or light) with the arrival of a reward, the animal will form an association between this stimulus and the reward. Subsequently, the animal will display anticipatory behaviour at the presentation of the stimulus. This behavioural response can be investigated in the interval between the announcement and the actual arrival of the reward and is characterised by an increase in activity. This anticipatory increase in activity is determined by means of the analysis of the total frequency of all displayed behavioural elements. The results show that previous experiences influence anticipatory behaviour for a reward and, thus, that this spontaneous behavioural response may serve as a welfare indicator. Furthermore, it became apparent that regular reward-announcements can counteract the consequences of stress. Interestingly, a reward in the form of an enriched cage (cage with several objects to increase the possibilities for species-specific behaviour) could even reverse the effects of chronic stress (depressive-like symptoms). Summarizing, the results described in this thesis indicate that announcing and presenting rewards may be a useful tool to both measure and improve welfare of animals. Important to note is the fact that this tool is based on the spontaneous behavioural response of animals and is therefore, in contrast to the nowadays mostly used invasive and stressful methods, a non-invasieve method to assess welfare. Furthermore, the results indicate that enrichment of the currently used poor housing conditions of laboratory rats (and probably also other animals) can serve to counteract stress (e.g. induced by experimental procedures) and, thus, may be a simple first step to take to improve animal welfare.

AB  - Neuroscience ; University of Maryland, Baltimore ; Ph.D. ; One consequence of the opioid epidemic are the lasting neurodevelopmental sequelae of perinatal opioid exposure. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid has recently increased in use, resulting in coinciding increases in perinatally-exposed infants. A translationally relevant and developmentally accurate preclinical model is needed to understand the long-lasting neurobiological abnormalities resulting from perinatal fentanyl exposure, as well as treatment interventions that can ameliorate these deficits. In Chapter 1, we develop a model of perinatal fentanyl exposure. Our data reveal that fentanyl has several developmental consequences to sensory function and behavior. Newborn mice exhibit somatic withdrawal and weight fluctuations. During adolescence, they display decreased grooming and anxiety-like behavior. By adulthood, they display impaired auditory discrimination. As fentanyl exposure does not affect maternal health or behavior, these effects appear to result from direct actions of perinatal fentanyl on the developing brain. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate that perinatal fentanyl exposure impairs somatosensory circuit function and behavior. We found a long-lasting reduction of synaptic excitation of primary somatosensory (S1) layer 5 neurons, as evidenced by decreases in stochastic and evoked excitatory release probability, and NMDA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents. In contrast, anterior cingulate cortical neurons exhibit increased synaptic excitation. Analysis of electrocorticograms revealed suppressed ketamine-evoked γ oscillations. Morphological analysis of S1 layer 5 pyramidal neurons indicate reduced dendritic complexity, length, and soma size. Further, we detected abnormal cortical mRNA expression of key receptors involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal growth and development. These findings demonstrate the lasting sequelae of perinatal fentanyl exposure on sensory processing and function. In Chapter 3, we demonstrate that developmental ...

AB  - Environmental manipulations can enhance neuroplasticity in the brain, with enrichment- induced cognitive improvements being linked to increased expression of growth factors, such as neurotrophins, and enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis. Environmental enrichment can ameliorate the memory decline reported in normal ageing and in animal models of Alzheimer?s disease, Huntington?s disease and depression. Thus, this may be a particularly beneficial therapeutic intervention against age-related cognitive decline. Environmental enrichment is defined as the addition of social, physical and somatosensory stimulation into an animal?s environment via larger group housing, extra objects and often, running wheels. Previous studies from our lab report that physical activity alone is a potent memory enhancer but that long-term environmental stimulation can be as effective as exercise at ameliorating age-related memory decline. Therefore, it is crucial to dissociate the different factors of environmental enrichment, and to elucidate the associated neurochemical mechanisms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of environmental enrichment, in the absence of exercise, as a cognitive enhancer and assess the underlying mechanisms involved, with particular focus upon the roles of neurotrophins and neurogenesis in mediating this effect. ; TARA (Trinity?s Access to Research Archive) has a robust takedown policy.

It was frozen rapidly with liquid nitrogen and stored until use at -80 ° C for biochemical analysis. BDNF and NGF levels were measured in these samples. In conlusion, while enriched environment was a positive effect on spatial learning, social isolation was a negative effect on spatial learning and increase thigmotactic behaviors. According to the analysis results NGF and BDNF levels in the hippocampus and plasma did not change with environmental conditions and exercise. Time of exposure to social isolation, procedures of the enriched environment, time of exposure to the environment, type and duration of exercise and gender may affect the results. ; Bu araştırma Selçuk Üniversitesi Bilimsel Araştırma Projeleri Koordinatörlüğü tarafından 14202035 proje numarası ile desteklenmiştir.

AB  - A Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may appear after experiencing a stressful situation and is characterized by avoidance of situations that remind the trauma and persistent hyperarousal, and may come associated with anxiety and cognitive disabilities. Although their treatment is usually pharmacological, non-pharmacological interventions has been shown to be effective. While nonpharmacologic strategy, an environmental enrichment (EE) results in decreased anxiety and improving memory in several animal experiments. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental enrichment on anxiety like behavior and memory in mice submitted to a model of PTSD, with different re-exposure to the situational reminders (1 or 10 minutes). For this, male Swiss mice, exposed or not to environmental enrichment, were submitted to a model of PTSD, in a dark-light box (DL-box). After this aversive procedure (scrambled shock of a 0.5mA and re-exposure to situational reminders), the animals were tested in a DL-box and a modified DL-box (mDL-box), in an elevated plus maze (EPM) and to a new object recognition test. The results demonstrated that, in non-enrichment animals, aversive stimulation without situational reminders increased anxiety like behaviors and traumatic memory in DL-box, but not in the mDL-box. Aversive stimulation with situational reminder of one minute increased anxiety like behaviors and traumatic memory in DL-box, in mDL-box and in EPM, while the aversive stimulation with 10 minutes situational reminders reduced anxiety like behaviors and traumatic memory. Environmental enrichment attenuated the effects of the shock. On groups with situational reminders of one minute, environmental enrichment did not change anxiety like behaviors and memory but reverted the sensitization in the EPM, and on groups with one-minute situational reminders, resulted in increased anxiety like behaviors and traumatic memory in DL-box, as well as decrease in total entries in the dark side of mDL-box.

AB  - Major depression is a complex disorder characterized by behavioral and cognitive impairments triggered by various factors including genetic predispositions, stress and environment. The pathophysiology of depression is poorly understood. Numerous evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is associated with depression. Alternative therapeutic strategies are needed and "positive" life experiences could be an efficient way to help the remission of the disorder. To study the potential antidepressant effects of such “positive” living conditions, we used the enriched environment (EE) paradigm on mice. The aim of our work was to fully characterize the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects of EE in a well-characterized murine model of depression-like behavior induced by long-term administration of corticosterone. We showed that EE efficiently reverses the anxiety/depression‐like state of mice and reduces neuroinflammation. Moreover, we identified the adipokine Adiponectin as a key player in the beneficial effects of EE. We reported that increased levels of Adiponectin in the brain led to microglia phenotype and activation state regulation, thus reducing global brain inflammation in mice. Indeed, the anti-inflammatory and antidepressants effects of EE are abolished in Adiponectin deficient mice. We demonstrated that anti-inflammatory actions of Adiponectin on microglia is mediated through the Adiponectin Receptor 1. Those results highlight the key role of the adiponergic system in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we tested the effect of AdipoRon, a potent Adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 agonist on corticosterone-treated mice. AdipoRon successfully reversed the corticosterone-induced depression-like state in mice. AdipoRon exerted its pleiotropic actions on various systems including hippocampal neurogenesis, serotonergic neurotransmission and neuroinflammation, which can explain its antidepressant properties. Together, our findings bring insight into the beneficial effects of "positive" life ...

The EE consists in large number of mice in large cages including numerous objects (nests, tunnels, wheels .) which are changed frequently. EE induces increased voluntary physical activity, optimal conditions for stimulation of social interactions, exploratory behavior and cognitive functions. EE has beneficial effects on physiological processes in many systems (hormonal, cardiovascular, immune system.). EE reduces anxio-depressive behavior, improves learning and memory. These effects are underpinned by changes in the brain and particularly in the hippocampus, where EE induce more neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Interestingly, in immunodeficient mice, memory performance and neurogenesis are highly impaired, suggesting a bidirectional interaction between the immune system and the brain. Among the cells of the immune system, T cells appear to play a major role in neuronal plasticity mechanisms. Our objective was to characterize the role of T cells in EE’s effects on cerebral plasticity and to investigate whether these effects imply a modification of T cells by EE. ; La plasticité cérébrale est une capacité remarquable des cellules du cerveau à adapter leur structure et fonction en réponse à l’expérience et l’environnement.

AB  - Major depression is a complex disorder characterized by behavioral and cognitive impairments triggered by various factors including genetic predispositions, stress and environment. The pathophysiology of depression is poorly understood. Numerous evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is associated with depression. Alternative therapeutic strategies are needed and "positive" life experiences could be an efficient way to help the remission of the disorder. To study the potential antidepressant effects of such “positive” living conditions, we used the enriched environment (EE) paradigm on mice. The aim of our work was to fully characterize the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects of EE in a well-characterized murine model of depression-like behavior induced by long-term administration of corticosterone. We showed that EE efficiently reverses the anxiety/depression‐like state of mice and reduces neuroinflammation. Moreover, we identified the adipokine Adiponectin as a key player in the beneficial effects of EE. We reported that increased levels of Adiponectin in the brain led to microglia phenotype and activation state regulation, thus reducing global brain inflammation in mice. Indeed, the anti-inflammatory and antidepressants effects of EE are abolished in Adiponectin deficient mice. We demonstrated that anti-inflammatory actions of Adiponectin on microglia is mediated through the Adiponectin Receptor 1. Those results highlight the key role of the adiponergic system in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we tested the effect of AdipoRon, a potent Adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 agonist on corticosterone-treated mice. AdipoRon successfully reversed the corticosterone-induced depression-like state in mice. AdipoRon exerted its pleiotropic actions on various systems including hippocampal neurogenesis, serotonergic neurotransmission and neuroinflammation, which can explain its antidepressant properties.

AB  - La dépression est une pathologie multifactorielle induisant des troubles psychiques et physiques. De nouvelles thérapies visant à enrichir l’environnement des patients par des activités physiques, sociales et cognitives aident à la rémission en complément des traitements pharmacologiques. Cependant les bases moléculaires sous-jacentes aux bénéfices observés dans ces thérapies sont méconnues. C’est dans ce contexte que nous avons étudié les effets de ces thérapies via la mise en place d’un modèle murin d’environnement enrichi (EE). L’objectif de ma thèse a été d’évaluer les effets antidépresseurs de l’EE sur un modèle murin de dépression et d’identifier une nouvelle cible thérapeutique. J’ai montré que l’administration chronique de corticostérone induit un état dépressif et une neuroinflammation qui peuvent être réversés par l’EE. De plus, mes travaux ont mis en évidence, l'adiponectine (ApN), comme étant un acteur clef des effets de l'EE. J’ai montré que l’EE via l’ApN était capable de limiter la neuroinflammation. Par ailleurs, la caractérisation de souris n’exprimant pas l’ApN a montré que ces souris étaient insensibles en partie aux effets de l’EE. Par la suite, je me suis intéressée à la voie de signalisation de l’ApN impliquée dans ses effets anti-inflammatoires, j’ai montré que l’ApN inhibe l’activation de la microglie en se liant à son récepteur AdipoR1. Enfin, j’ai testé l’effet de l’AdipoRon, un agoniste des récepteurs de l’adiponectine, sur des souris traitées par la corticostérone. J’ai montré que l’AdipoRon réduisait l’état « dépressif » de ces souris. Mon travaille suggère que les effets antidépresseurs de l’AdipoRon sont dus à sa pléiotropie car il agit simultanément sur différents systèmes altérés dans la dépression dont la neurogenèse hippocampique, la neurotransmission sérotoninergique et la neuroinflammation. Pour conclure ce travail met en avant les effets bénéfiques de l’EE sur la dépression et la neuroinflammation. De plus, ils identifient l’ApN et sa voie de signalisation comme de nouvelles cibles prometteuses dans le traitement de la dépression. ; Major depression is a complex disorder characterized by behavioral and cognitive impairments triggered by various factors including genetic predispositions, stress and environment.

AB  - Environmental Enrichment (EE) can be considered as a set of environmental changes that can adjust the model of a species and favor well-being in captive animals. The present study intends to investigate the influence of EE (cardboard roll) on behavioral and epigenetic modulations in murine females of the LG/J strain in different life stages. For this, four groups were determined: group 1, positive control – continuous EE; group 2, negative control – EE absent; group 3 – EE in the pubertal phase (3 and 4 weeks of age); and group 4 – EE in the maternal phase. The emotionality of all females was evaluated by the Open Field, Elevated Plus Maze and Forced Swim tests. The mother's performance was also evaluated in terms of maternal posture (litter size, nest construction, puppies weight, placentophagy and aggressiveness against intruders) and in the Puppies Recovery Test (self grooming and mother-puppies interaction by licking, nursing and litter rescue time). Females seem, in general, to naturally present anxious and depressive behavior that intensified in later life stages. However, the use of environmental enrichment seems to mitigate these behavioral responses. Likewise, exposing females to enrichment only in the pubertal phase seems to have reflected in anxious and depressive-like behaviors in the later phase (post-weaning). The enrichment in the maternal phase promoted improvements in the posture of the females, in which the litters suffered less loss of puppies, the nests built were taller and warmer, and the puppies had more protection by the mothers in the analysis of aggression against intruders and in the rescue test. After the phenotypic analyses, it was possible to sequence a hypothalamus sample using the pocket sequencer, Oxford Nanopore MinION, which allowed learning methodologies of a fourth generation sequencing technology. Our results allowed the enrichment of discussions in the research area and support new work by our group, in the search for epigenetic markers associated with animal welfare. ...

AB  - Early rehabilitation is considered to have favorable outcomes for stroke patients. However, the optimal strategy for early rehabilitation is unclear because there is currently limited data on the effects of very early initiation of rehabilitation based on voluntary exercise (VE). Environmental enrichment (EE) is a therapeutic paradigm for laboratory animals that consists of complex combinations of physical, cognitive, and social stimuli and VE. During the hyperacute phase of ischemic stroke, upregulation of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis is observed. Therefore, inhibition of Fas/FasL-signaling may be a promising neuroprotective strategy. Few studies delineated the effect of EE on apoptosis in an experimental model of hyperacute stroke. The aim of the study is to determine whether hyperacute exposure to EE can regulate Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and improve neurobehavioral function. C57Bl/6 mice were randomly assigned to either EE or standard cage (SC) within 3 hours after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury for 2 weeks. Neurobehavioral tests, transcriptome analysis, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and total infarct volume was calculated. Compared with SC, hyperacute exposure to EE was associated with greater improvement in anxiety, motor function, and cognition, reduced total infarct volume, and decreased neuronal death. It significantly downregulated Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis, decreased expression of Fas, FADD, cleaved caspase-8/caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, as well as Bax/Bcl-2 in both regions. Overall, the results of this study implicate very early exposure to EE/VE as a promising neuroprotective candidate for therapeutic translation after stroke by effective inhibition of extrinsic as well as intrinsic apoptotic pathways. ; open ; 박사

AB  - L'étude de l'impact des facteurs environnementaux sur les effets à long-terme des psychostimulants a montré que des facteurs négatifs, comme le stress, augmentent le risque de développer une addiction, alors que des facteurs positifs, comme l'exposition à des conditions stimulantes, le réduisent. Une partie de cette thèse a consisté à rechercher les mécanismes neurobiologiques et cellulaires qui sous-tendent cette influence environnementale. Ainsi, l'exposition d'animaux à un environnement enrichi (EE), qui procure des conditions stimulantes, diminue leur niveau d'anxiété, un effet qui serait en partie lié à la régulation de gènes appartenant au système cannabinoïde endogène (SCE) dans des régions impliquées dans la réactivité au stress (article 1). Par ailleurs, nos travaux ont mis en évidence des limites de l'exposition à l'EE : quand celle-ci est interrompue, ses effets bénéfiques sont perdus et la vulnérabilité à la cocaïne est même augmentée. Ceci s'expliquerait par l'apparition d'un état émotionnel négatif, associé à une activation du facteur CREB dans l'amygdale étendue, une région carrefour entre la récompense et le stress (article 2). Nous nous sommes aussi intéressés à la toxicité de la méthamphétamine et à sa modulation par le SCE, pour lequel des propriétés neuroprotectives avaient déjà été suggérées. Ainsi, une stimulation pharmacologique du SCE permet de prévenir la neurotoxicité dopaminergique induite par la méthamphétamine (article 3). Nos résultats soulignent la complexité d'utilisation des manipulations environnementales et mettent en lumière les capacités protectives du SCE contre la dépendance et la neurotoxicité engendrées par les psychostimulants. ; Studies of the impact of environmental factors on the long-term effects of psychostimulants have shown that negative factors, such as stress, increase the risk of developing drug addiction, while positive factors, such as exposure to stimulating conditions, reduce it. The first aim of this thesis work was to look for the neurobiological and cellular mechanisms that underlie this environmental influence. We found that exposure of animals to stimulating enriched environments (EE) reduces anxiety levels, an effect that may be partly related to the regulation of genes belonging to the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) in regions involved in stress reactivity (Article 1). In addition, our work has highlighted some limitations of the exposure to EE since discontinuation of enrichment results not only in the loss of its beneficial effects but also in increased vulnerability to cocaine. This effect is associated with emotional distress associated and changes in the activity of the transcription factor CREB in the extended amygdala, an interface region between reward and stress processes (Article 2). We also investigated whether ECS, for which neuroprotective properties have already been suggested, could reduce the brain toxicity induced by methamphetamine. We found that pharmacological stimulation of ECS provides protection against the methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity (Article 3). Our results highlight the complex consequences of environmental conditions on brain and behavior and highlight the protective role of ECS against both addiction and neurotoxicity induced by psychostimulants.

AB  - Poruchy autistického spektra (PAS) patří k jedněm z nejzávažnějších vrozených neurovývojových poškození. Ačkoliv je již známo mnoho rizikových faktorů, které mohou PAS navozovat, přesná etiologie není známa. Tato diplomová práce se zaměřuje na různé možnosti studia PAS skrze hlodavčí animální modely. Hlavním cílem experimentální části práce bylo prověřit projevy PAS u potkaního genetického modelu tuberózní sklerózy (tzv. potkaní linie Eker) a zjistit vliv rozdílných chovných prostředí na autistický fenotyp. Zvířata byla chována po dobu jednoho roku a v průběhu jejich života jsme provedli celkem tři série behaviorálních testů ve věku 45, 90 a 365 dní. Testování bylo zaměřeno na měření explorační aktivity, úzkosti a sociality. Naše výsledky ukázaly, že aktivita v otevřeném poli byla u mladých potkanů nesoucích mutaci vyšší. Úzkost projevovaná ve vyvýšeném křížovém bludišti byla snížena obohaceným prostředím. V sociální interakci se výrazně projevil vliv obohaceného prostředí zvýšením parametru self-grooming. U potkaní linie Eker z neobohaceného prostředí byl nižší výskyt komplexnější očisty těla. Ultrazvuková komunikace se výrazně měnila v závislosti na věku potkanů. Potvrdili jsme, že obohacené prostředí má závažný vliv na chování potkanů, zatímco samotný genetický model nevyvolává v chování výrazné. ; Autism spectrum disorders are among the most severe congenital neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Currently, widely used in zoos and aquariums, in addition to being adopted in vivariums, environmental enrichment aims to allow the captive animal to express its species-specific behavior, improving its quality of life. Maternal care is intrinsic to emotionality, as a female to satisfactorily care for her offspring needs to be in excellent physical and emotional condition. When we think about mammals, it is known that maternal care has complex genetic bases and is susceptible to interference from environmental factors. Result of the individual-environment interaction, epigenetics comprises molecular changes in DNA and histone proteins, which are likely to be inherited, do not modify the DNA sequence and may undergo reversibility. This study aimed to verify the influence of environmental enrichment in a transgenerational way in females of Mus musculus LG/J on aspects of emotionality and maternal care. The females studied were divided into four groups and had never been exposed to environmental enrichment, namely: female daughters of mothers who were exposed to environmental enrichment from the pubertal to maternal stage, female daughters of mothers who were never exposed to environmental enrichment, female daughters from mothers who were submitted to environmental enrichment in the maternal phase and females daughters of mothers who were exposed to environmental enrichment only in the maternal phase. Emotionality was analyzed using open field, elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests. Maternal care was analyzed by the mother's postures in building a nest, performing placentophagy, offering milk to the young, having aggressive behavior against intruders and maintaining the size of the born litter. The results showed that phenotypically, the influences of environmental enrichment on emotionality and maternal care were not inherited, with females from non-enriched mothers having greater reproductive success and a lower rate of anxiety. The study showed that in this case, environmental enrichment must be applied ...

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is dopamine neuronal degenerative disease along with α-Synuclein (α-Syn) accumulation and Lewy body (LB) formation in the striatum (STR) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). PD shows motor dysfunctions and non-motor dysfunctions such as olfactory dysfunction, depression, and cognitive decline. Despite the continuous endeavors to develop drugs for dopamine neuroprotection and behavioral improvements, there are still needs for effective and non-invasive treatments, dependent on disease progress in PD. Environmental enrichment (EE) not only protects dopamine neurons, promotes motor ability and cognitive function improvement, and regulates Reelin protein expressions in PD but also contributes to prevent amyloid β fibril formation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although previous studies revealed that Reelin and RELN expression patterns were changed in PD patient Cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs), stages of PD dependent Reelin and RELN levels in the STR as well as PD progression dependent EE effects have not to be uncovered yet. Hence, this study tested motor abilities, non-motor abilities, and olfactory function after EE exposure for 8 weeks to 4- or 14-month-old A53T α-Syn (Tg) mouse animal model of PD. For biochemistry analysis, qRT-PCR was conducted for the pattern of RELN expression and IHC or western blot was proceeded for TH, Reelin, DRD receptors (DRD1, DRD2), APOER2, LAMP- 1, VAMP 7, and NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A, NR2B) in the STR at both points of disease stages. The results demonstrated that in the 6-month-old (early stage of PD) mice STR, RELN, Reelin, total α-Syn, and toxic α-Syn (phosphorylated α-Syn, α-SynpS129) expression levels were increased. TH+ dopamine neurons were decreased in the SN while no change was observed in the STR. Early expose to EE contributed to protect dopamine neurons, to decrease total α-Syn, α-SynpS129 and the number of aggregated proteins, and to preserve protein expression levels for Reelin, DRD1, DRD2, LAMP 1, NR2A, and NR2B as same levels as non-Tg mouse proteins in the STR. In addition, behavioral analysis proved preventive effects of EE on olfactory dysfunction, motor disability, and cognitive decline. In late stage of A53T α-Syn animal model of PD (16-month-old), TH+ dopamine neurons were reduced in both STR and SN and EE was not helpful for dopamine neuronal recovery. RELN and Reelin expressions were decreased at16-month-old mouse STR but EE exposure restored Reelin protein expression to the same level of non-Tg mouse. Unlike 6-month-old early stage of mouse STR, the increased level of toxic α-Syn proteins were detected in 16-month-old late stage of mouse STR and SN. Although the level of toxic α-Syn in the SN was significantly reduced after later life EE, the total α-Syn and aggregated protein expression levels were unchanged compared to Tg mouse at 16-month-old late stage of PD. EE expose to late stage of PD mouse improved olfactory impairment, muscle strength weakness, and imbalanced reciprocal walking behaviors, whereas cognitive impairment and hyperactivity were not significantly retrieved after EE at 16-month-old mouse model of PD. In addition, after later life EE, expression patterns for DRD1, DRD2, APOER2, NR2A became like that of non-Tg mouse in the STR. However, EE in late stage of PD mouse had no significant effects on LAMP 1, VAMP 7, NR1, NR2B protein recovery to the extent of non-Tg mouse proteins in the STR. In vitro study suggested that Reelin could be a promising candidate for PD treatment by decreasing total and aggregated α-Syn levels via LAMP1 increase in PFFs treated SH-SY5Y cells. This study suggests that stages of PD (early/late) could be determined by Reelin expression level in the STR so that it might help to decide which drugs or treatment interventions would be best for patients depending on PD progress. In addition, this study provides an evidence that EE intervention in early stage of PD could be more effective rather than in late stage of PD on behavioral function improvements as well as on dopamine neuroprotection. To sum up, this study proposes that EE intervention in early stage of PD would have the optimal effects for improvement and appropriate time point for EE intervention could be made by Reelin levels as a prominent biomarker in the STR for PD. ; open ; 박사

AB  - ilustraciones, fotografías a color, gráficas ; Las interacciones madre-hijo influyen en la fisiología, desarrollo y el comportamiento durante las primeras semanas después del nacimiento. Como una experiencia adversa en la vida temprana, la separación materna (SM), produce trastornos de las funciones conductuales y neuroendocrinas en áreas cerebrales que construyen el eje emocional. Los estudios en roedores han demostraron que la separación prolongada causa una cantidad significativa de estrés. Las consecuencias de este estrés, particularmente la hiperreactividad del eje HPA (hipotalámico-pituitario-adrenal), se expresan en la edad adulta y persisten de por vida. Se ha propuesto al ambiente enriquecido (AE), como una estrategia para mitigar el impacto negativo reportados en los individuos que presentan estrés por separación materna, sin embargo, su efecto sobre estos individuos está determinado no solo por las características de este, sino también por la etapa, sexo y condiciones de la SM. Por lo anterior, el objetivo de este trabajo consistió en evaluar el efecto de 15 dias de AE, sobre el Factor neutrofico derivado del cerebro (BDNF) como marcador de plasticidad y los astrocitos, como elementos multifuncionales, en ratas adolescentes, con estrés por separación materna. Metodología: 73 ratas (36 machos-37 hembras) se distribuyeron en dos categorías generales: Sin separación materna y ratas con separación materna, luego del destete dichas categorías se subdividieron en dos condiciones de vivienda (Estándar-A. enriquecido).

AB  - Alterations in neural tissues associated with environmental variables have been studied for many years. Anatomical changes in the neocortex of rats in response to exposure to complex environments were observed and replicated in a number of studies both within and across species. These changes are not dependent on the age of the animal or on the duration of exposure, and have been demonstrated in structures outside of the cortex. Due to the undisputed involvement of both the neocortex and the hippocampus in learning and memory, researchers applied a widely used model system of a synaptic mechanism for learning, long-term potentiation (LTP), to the environmental enrichment paradigm and demonstrated significant enhancements in hippocampal field potentials in enriched rats. The present study examines whether the neocortex also showed evidence of plasticity in synaptic transmission. No effects for environmental enrichment were observed on the maximum amplitude of neocortical field responses evoked from the corpus callosum. To assess the plasticity of the chronic preparation used in the study, the animals were exposed to trains of pulses previously shown to induce electrical LTP in the cortex, but revealed only a slight, although significant, depression of the evoked response amplitude. An alteration in the stimulation parameters did not result in an enhanced response. Cortical depth measures suggested that the enriched environment was indeed sufficient to produce plastic changes in anatomy, if not in the efficacy of synaptic transmission. The importance of these findings in the neocortex leads us to question the validity of the LTP model of learning and memory. ; Thesis ; Master of Science (MSc)

AB  - Neurogenesis and angiogenesis are stimulated by a number of antidepressant treatments, and cellular plasticity has emerged as a phenomenon with great relevance to the etiology and treatment of depression. In paper I we characterize how ECS-induced endothelial cell proliferation leads to vascularization of the adult rat hippocampus. In the molecular layer of the hippocampus a series of 10 ECS-treatments results in 30% more endothelial cells and 16% longer vessels in treated animals compared to untreated control animals. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been proposed to occur in an angiogenic niche, with neuronal progenitors clustering close to vessels and intimately associated with dividing endothelial cells. In paper two we describe an uncoupling of the angiogenic and the neurogenic proliferative responses to ECS-treatment. The robust increase in endothelial cell proliferation following ECS-treatment is ablated in animals receiving daily injections with the stress hormone cortic osterone (CORT). Despite the inhibition of the ECS-induced angiogenesis, neuronal progenitor proliferation continues unhindered. In paper III we demonstrate increased endothelial cell proliferation in the hippocampus of animals that were exposed to environmental enrichment. The same effect was found in animals with access to running wheels. An increased endothelial cell proliferation is furthermore described in the prefrontal cortex of enriched animals, whereas running had no effect in this brain region. CORT-treated animals on the contrary displayed a 90% reduction in the number of newborn endothelial cells in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Age is a strong negative regulator of both neurogenesis and angiogenes, and newborn cells are scarce in the hippocampus of aged animals. Despite their well established neurogenic effect, an inability of antidepressant drugs to stimulate neurogenesis in aged animals has been reported. In the fourth paper we examine the cap acity of ECS-treatment to stimulate cellular proliferation in aged ...

AB  - © 2017 Dr Jake Rogers ; Serotonergic (5-HTergic) signaling is implicated in the manifestation of psychiatric disorders and regulates hippocampus-dependent cognitive and emotional processing that can underpin them. Clinical evidence indicates that serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene polymorphisms are associated with anxiety disorders and deficits in cognition. In animal models, exercise and environmental enrichment (EE) can change emotionality-related behaviours as well as enhance some aspects of cognition. We aimed to determine the therapeutic effects of exercise versus EE (which does not include running wheels) on constitutive 5-HT1AR and 5-HTT knock-out (KO) mice phenotypes. 5-HT1AR KO mice have an anxiety-like phenotype as well as hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits. In addition to increased anxiety-like behaviour, 5-HTT KO mice also have a depression-like phenotype. The Morris water maze (MWM) is one of the most widely cited behavioural tasks in neuroscience. It measures the capability of the hippocampus to create a viewpoint invariant cognitive map of a distal cue array to find a hidden platform escape goal. Using a Matlab classification algorithm of the search strategy utilised to find the escape during MWM spatial learning, we have shown that increases in the odds of more hippocampus-dependent (allocentric) strategy selection is the key measure indicating the formation of this map to the escape location. Furthermore, using this measure we demonstrated a novel cognitive enhancement due to exercise (but not EE) for the first time. We also showed that 5-HT1AR KO mice had a significant reduction in the likelihood of an allocentric strategy selection. This deficit provides a novel explanation for their impaired long-term memory on the MWM retention probe. Strikingly, we found that these increases in spatial strategy selection through exercise corrected the long-term spatial memory deficits displayed by the 5-HT1AR KO mice. Assessing emotionality-related behaviours in both models dissociated further therapeutic effects of exercise from EE. Exercise (but not EE) had an antidepressant-like effect in 5-HTT KO mice, rescuing their deficit on the forced-swim test. In contrast, our EE paradigm (but not exercise access) reduced anxiety-like behaviours in both 5-HT1AR and 5-HTT KO mice. Furthermore, we report that 5-HTT KO mice had impaired synaptic plasticity by measuring long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and exercise also rescued this deficit. Exercise elicited robust increases in adult-born cell survival in wild-type (WT) mice. Exercising 5-HTT KO mice did also have increased adult-born cell survival but had a 3-fold decrease in the level compared to exercising WT mice. LTP and adult neurogenesis are both hypothesised to contribute to antidepressant effects, so our study adds support to the hypothesis that LTP and neurogenesis changes drive the antidepressant-like effect of exercise in 5-HTT KO mice. Surprisingly, in 5-HTT HET mice exercise induced a deficit in LTP compared to WT control mice and there were no exercise-induced increases in adult-born cell survival. 5-HTT HET mice in the standard-housing condition displayed enhanced cognitive flexibility and this behaviour was not present in exercising 5-HTT HET mice. Prevalent 5-HT1AR or 5-HTT targeted drugs are established treatments in various psychiatric disorders. Functional polymorphisms in both the 5-HT1AR and the 5-HTT genes are associated with increased risk of developing various psychiatric disorders as well as with increased insensitivity to their unique sets of targeted pharmacology. Unfortunately, for this and for other reasons, not all patients have efficacious responses to these established interventions, so novel therapies are required. The therapeutic effects of exercise and EE we uncovered do not seem to require one of either the 5-HT1AR or the 5-HTT, although further mechanistic studies are required to substantiate that conclusion. Therefore, the preclinical evidence contained herein adds support for clinically employing analogous environmental manipulations, such as brief durations of cognitive-behavioural therapy and/or exercise regimes, as viable therapeutic alternatives for such patients.

AB  - While women are diagnosed with depression at twice the rate of men, pre-clinical research on this topic has relied heavily on the responses of male animals. This thesis examined the behavioural and physiological effects of environmental manipulation in the female Wistar-Kyoto rat, a putative animal model of depression. At postnatal day 52, baseline behavioural measures were collected in 36 Wistar and 36 Wistar-Kyoto female rats using the following tests: the elevated plus maze to assess anxiety, the forced swim test for depression-like behaviour, and sucrose preference test to assess hedonic status. At postnatal day 62, the rats were randomly assigned to one of three environments for 30 days: 1) standard housing - 3 rats in one large cage 2) isolated housing - 1 rat per small cage, or 3) environmental enrichment - 6 animals in a multistory cage filled with novel objects and a running wheel. Following 30 days in their housing condition, the same behavioural measures were again collected. Large differences ...

AB  - [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT REQUEST OF AUTHOR.] Previous research has shown a genetic variant in the serotonin transporter gene (Slc6a4) can increase the severity of a person's reaction to stress. This variant interacts with environmental stressors resulting in poorer health outcomes. Previous studies have also found that stressing pregnant mothers who carry the variant can result in an increased likelihood of autism diagnosis for the child. This maternal genotype x prenatal stress interaction has been modeled in the serotonin transporter knockout (SERT KO) mouse--dams genetically modified to mimic humans carrying the short allele were stressed during pregnancy resulting in offspring showing altered social behavior, repetitive behavior, and anxiety behavior. The first study included in this dissertation attempted to replicate this model while using a foster dam paradigm to avoid potential maternal care confounds. Surprisingly, the results showed that equalizing maternal care equalized several group differences in behavior. It is theorized that this is due to elimination of the neonatal insult from poor maternal care that would correspond to a human prenatal insult during a previously identified critical time period. The second study explored the potential effects environmentally enriched home cages on anxiety like behaviors of SERT KO mice. The study showed that all animals, regardless of genotype, showed fewer anxiety like behaviors in the open field assay. Together, these studies expand on our understanding of environmental influence on SERT KO mice used in translational studies. ; Includes bibliographical references.

Skripsi, Fakultas Kedokteran Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta. Latar Belakang: Depresi merupakan gangguan psikis yang paling sering terjadi. Patogenesis serta patofisiologi depresi yang kompleks serta belum adanya teori yang mendukung secara penuh mengakibatkan tatalaksana depresi yang ada saat ini masih terbilang kurang efektif dan menimbulkan banyak efek samping. Environmental enrichment (EE) dapat mempengaruhi struktur dan fungsi otak yang dapat mencegah kerusakan akibat stres. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui efek antidepresan EE pada tikus putih (Rattus novergicus) yang mengalami depresi setelah dipapar unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Metode: Penelitian ini bersifat eksperimental laboratorik yang dilakukan di Laboratorium Anatomi FK UNS. Sampel berupa tikus putih galur Wistar jantan, usia 1,5 bulan, berat badan ( BB) ± 100 gram. Sampel sebanyak 18 ekor diperoleh secara purposive sampling, dibagi dalam 3 kelompok secara acak. Sebelum perlakuan, BB tikus putih ditimbang terlebih dahulu. Kelompok Kontrol (KK) hanya diberikan makan dan minum. Kelompok Perlakuan 1(KP1) diberi perlakuan berupa UCMS selama 21 hari. Kelompok Perlakuan 2 (KP2) diberi perlakuan berupa UCMS dan EEselama 21 hari. Pada hari ke-22, BB sesudah perlakuan dihitung dan perilaku depresi diuji melalui Forced Swim Test (FST). Pada hari ke-23 sampai 25, dilakukan Sucrose Preference Test (SPT). Data FST dan SPT dianalisis dengan uji One-Way ANOVA, sedangkan body weight gain dianalisis dengan uji Kruskal-Wallis (α = 0,05). Hasil: Rerata durasi imobilitas pada KK, KP1, KP2 adalah 8,50±2,790 detik, 16,83±3,33 detik, 12,83±2,810 detik, hasil tersebut memperlihatkan EE mempunyai kecenderungan mengurangi durasi imobilitas akibat paparan stres. Namun, hasil uji statistik untuk FST tidak menunjukkan adanya perbedaan bermakna antara ketiga kelompok (p = 0,177). Rata-rata konsumsi larutan sukrosa dalam SPT pada KK, KP1 KP2 adalah 57,00±8,075 ml,17,67±3,353 ml, 33,33±4,145 ml, Rata-rata body weight gain pada KK, KP1, KP2 adalah 32,50±7,500 gr, 10,83±3,745gr, 20,83±2,007 gr. EE secara signifikan dapat meningkatkan konsumsi larutan sukrosa pada tikus yang mengalami stres (p = 0,001) dan dapat memelihara kenaikan BB selama stres berlangsung (p – 0,036). Simpulan:Environmental enrichment berpengaruh dalam memperbaiki perilaku depresi tikus putih (Rattus novergicus) yang timbul akibat paparan unpredictable chronic mild stress.

AB  - Chickens are constantly responding to environmental stimulation. These stimuli can be perceived as threatening or otherwise by birds. In view of this, environmental enrichment has been used as a tool to improve the welfare of intensively-raised farm animals. Experiment 1 was conducted to investigate the effects of auditory enrichment by means of classical music and Quran recitation, and regular human contact by means placing one hand inside the cage on growth performance, tonic immobility as an indicator of fear response and serum level of corticosterone (CORT) and ceruloplasmin (CPN) as physiological stress indicators in broiler chickens. A total of 768 day-old broiler chicks were subjected to the following treatments from day 1 to day 35 (i) no sound enrichment and without regular human contact, as control , (ii) no sound enrichment with regular human contact (HC), (iii) sound enrichment by classical music (Vivaldi’s Four Season) and without regular human contact (CM), (iv) sound enrichment by classical music with regular human contact (CMH), (v) sound enrichment by holy Quran recital (Yaseen chapter) without regular human contact (QR) and (vi) sound enrichment by holy Quran recital with regular human contact (QRH). Both sound stimuli were applied 3 hours a day intermittently. The regular human contact was conducted twice daily for 30 min between 10:30 h to 11:00 h, and 16:30 h to 17:00 h. For the regular human contact treatment, the experimenter entered the room gently with minimal noise and placed her right hand into the cage. There were no significant sound enrichment x human contact interactions for body weight (BW), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The CM birds had significantly greater BW on days 7 and 14 and higher FI on day 7 than control birds. Regular human contact had no effect on BW, FI or FCR of birds. Both CM and QR birds had significantly lower CORT on day 7 and day 11, and also lower CPN on day 35 when compared to controls. Sound enrichment had a negligible effect on tonic ...

AB  - The stress that our ancestors experienced resonates with us in their stories, and memoires, but does it affect our health? In this thesis, the impact of ancestral stress on offspring was investigated. We hypothesized that ancestral stress has a significant impact on the development of the stress response, neuromorphology, and behaviour. Moreover, as stress is multi-systematic in its effects, this study examined the use of a new stratification tool termed the cumulative animal allostatic load index (CAALM). In addition, we tested the influence of postnatal enriched environment (EE) on ancestral stress-induced deficits. Lastly, we investigated a “two-hit hypothesis” of maternal stress and inflammation on offspring development. Overall, results indicate that ancestral stress is transferred across generations and increases allostatic load, and EE reverses detrimental effects. Moreover, inflammation exacerbates the effect of stress. Altogether, our results shed light on the influence of maternal and ancestral health on offspring development and the benefit of EE.

Following 30 days in their housing condition, the same behavioural measures were again collected. Large differences between strains were found with the Wistar-Kyoto females showing significantly less mobility and activity in both the forced swim test and elevated plus maze. Sucrose preference was significantly higher after enrichment in both strains. Post-environment immune cytokine and corticosterone levels were also assessed in these animals at baseline and after the forced swim test. No difference in corticosterone between strains was found at baseline. However, Wistar-Kyoto females had significantly higher corticosterone levels than their Wistar counterparts after the forced swim test. In contrast, Wistar-Kyoto females showed significantly lower serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β than Wistar females. In the hippocampus, astroglial staining intensity was significantly increased in the CA1 of Wistar females after environmental enrichment. Glucocorticoid receptor staining in the CA3 was also increased after environmental enrichment in both the Wistar-Kyoto and Wistar animals. Finally there was a trend towards higher levels of glucocorticoid receptors in the amygdala in Wistar-Kyoto animals who experienced environmental enrichment. Taken together, this thesis provides evidence for the effect of environment, specifically enrichment, on behaviour and physiological systems. These results suggest that incorporating social and physical enrichment as part of clinical intervention may benefit individuals with depression.

AB  - Stroke is caused by an obstruction of blood flow to a part of the brain, resulting in brain damage. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the industrialized world, and the primary cause of adult-onset disability. There is a spontaneous recovery of function after stroke but several factors, such as the environment can influence the speed and extent of this recovery. This thesis deals with functional recovery after an experimental stroke in mice and how the surrounding environment can influence on such recovery. Housing mice in an enriched environment, with both physical and social stimulation, results in an improved motor function after focal ischemia. However stimulation must maintain for at least a month for stable recovery. The enriched environment affects gene expression as well as cell genesis in the brain. We show that a low endogenous level of BDNF leads to an improved motor function after stroke, similar to the improvement caused by exposure to the enriched environment. It has previously been shown that housing post-ischemic animals in a stimulating environment leads to a downregulation of the neurotrophic factor BDNF, indicating that a low level of BDNF is beneficial for motor function after stroke. In general this thesis shows that the effect of enriched environment on motor function after an experimental stroke is different to the affected pathways stimulated by the environment in the intact brain. Both the gene expression of NGFI-A and vimentin is downregulated after exposure to an enriched environment after stroke, as well as a downregulation of the level of cell genesis and cell migration to the striatum. The thesis suggests that the enriched environment appears to provide relevant sensori-motor input to the neuronal networks during the recovery phase, structuring gene expression and depressing redundant cell genesis, leading to an improved motor function in mice.

AB  - BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice are an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-like model and are characterized by similar behavioral and psychological symptoms as those presenting in patients with ASD. Such symptoms include difficulty in communication, impaired sociability, and increased engagement in repetitive stereotypic behaviors. Behavioral therapy is a common treatment for human ASD, but such non-pharmacological interventions remain to be explored in murine models. Here, we explored the effects of environmental enrichment (EE)—a housing condition consisting of larger space, running wheels, toys, etc. designed to stimulate complex social and cognitive engagement—in alleviating the symptoms of ASD. Juvenile BTBR mice were placed in standard or EE housing for 17 weeks while undergoing several behavioral and metabolic assessments. Following EE-exposure, male BTBR mice displayed reduced adiposity, increased lean mass, improved glycemic control, and decreased circulating leptin. Regarding behavior, EE-BTBR males displayed decreased anxiety and improved social affiliation but no changes in repetitive behaviors or social memory. Additionally, a gene expression profile of males showed an EE-induced upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB in several brain regions. Contrarily, female BTBR responded less readily to EE, displaying only modest adipose remodeling and no changes in glycemic control, circulating leptin, anxiety, sociability, or repetitive behaviors. These results suggest that EE improves metabolic and some behavioral phenotypes in a sexually-dimorphic manner in BTBR mice. ; No embargo ; Academic Major: Neuroscience

AB  - Background: Animal studies have shown that with increasing age, there is impaired cognition, enhanced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and reduced locomotor activity, accompanied by neurobiological changes, such as enhanced inflammation, decreased neurotrophins, and altered neurotransmitter levels. Evidence suggests that external environmental conditions can modify the effects of aging. Environmental enrichment (EE), where the immediate environment of experimental animals is modified, has been reported to reverse the adverse effects of brain aging. Past studies on EE have, however, also utilized physical exercise (PE) as a part of EE. Additionally, the duration of EE and the age of rodents varies greatly across studies. Hence, the current literature fails to explain the effects that PE has in EE studies across age, as well as the differential effects of the duration of EE, if any, on behavior and underlying molecular biology. Methods: We analyzed the differential effects of short-term PE, EE, and PE+EE, and the effects of short- vs. long-term EE on cognition-, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in 4-, 9- and 14-month-old C57BL/6 mice using an established behavioral battery. Changes in the expression of hippocampal genes, microglial and astrocyte numbers in the dentate gyrus, and T cell subsets in the cervical lymph nodes were also analyzed. Results: We found that short-term EE reversed the adverse effects of age on cognitive- and anxiety-like behaviors at 14 months. Conversely, short-term PE was found to impair cognition and enhance depressive-like behavior at 4 months. Furthermore, PE and PE+EE, but not EE alone, were observed to modify the expression of several hippocampal genes at 9 months compared to control mice. EE also enhanced the number of microglia in the dentate gyrus at 4 and 9 months while PE and PE+EE increased it only at 9 months. Significant differences were also noted between the treatment- and age-matched cohorts for the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets in the cervical ...

AB  - Master of Science ; Department of Psychological Sciences ; Mary Cain ; Individuals suffering from depression primarily rely on pharmacological interventions to alleviate the incapacitating symptoms of the disorder. In addition to genetic differences underlying the etiology of depression, environmental factors play a key role as well. For example, environmental enrichment results in various neurotransmitter alterations, significantly affecting serotonin. To test the efficacy of novel antidepressant drugs in the preclinical laboratory setting, researchers commonly implement the forced swim test (FST) for rats or mice. However, the effect of environmental enrichment on the expression of depressive-like states in the FST is unclear, and it is unknown whether environmental enrichment or social isolation can alter the efficacy of the commonly prescribed antidepressant drug, fluoxetine. In the present study, locomotor activity and FST performance were measured after 30 days of rearing in enriched (EC), standard (SC), and isolated (IC) conditions. Results showed that regardless of the significant effect of fluoxetine on locomotor activity in EC, SC, and IC rats, fluoxetine failed to increase swimming and decrease immobility in all three environmental conditions, with enriched-fluoxetine rats displaying significantly less swimming behavior in the FST than enriched rats receiving vehicle control injections. These results suggest that differential rearing, specifically environmental enrichment, can alter the efficacy of antidepressants and may suggest that enrichment reverses the effects of fluoxetine.

AB  - O enriquecimento ambiental pode ser considerado uma condição que proporciona aumento da estimulação sensorial, cognitiva e motora, que levaria, a curto e longo prazos, a mudanças comportamentais importantes. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos da exposição ao enriquecimento ambiental (1) na ansiedade e memória aversiva, ambos no labirinto em cruz elevado, (2) na memória operacional espacial no labirinto aquático de Morris, e (3) na neurogênese hipocampal, em ratos. Os animais foram expostos ao enriquecimento ambiental a partir do desmame (22 dias), onde permaneceram até o último dia de teste (17º mês). Nesse período, foram submetidos ao Labirinto em Cruz Elevado (LCE) no 3º e 15º mês, e ao Labirinto Aquático de Morris (LAM) no 9º e 16º mês. Uma semana antes da exposição ao labirinto aquático, receberam uma injeção intraperitonal de bromodeoxyuridina (BrdU). Vinte e quatro horas e trinta dias após essa injeção grupos independentes de animais foram sacrificados e seus encéfalos processados imunohistoquímicamente para revelar o BrdU. O enriquecimento ambiental produziu um efeito ansiolítico em animais jovens, mas não nos idosos. A memória aversiva de animais jovens e idosos não se alterou. No labirinto aquático, enquanto os animais expostos ao ambiente enriquecido por 9 meses apresentaram uma estratégia mais eficiente de busca em relação aos respectivos controles, os animais expostos ao ambiente enriquecido por 15 meses apresentaram mais flexibilidade para se adaptar as novas situações; no entanto, o enriquecimento ambiental parece não alterar diretamente o desempenho na memória operacional espacial. Em relação a neurogênese hipocampal, o enriquecimento foi capaz de aumentar cerca de 2 vezes o número de novas células; no entanto, a exposição ao labirinto aquático foi capaz de aumentar a taxa de sobrevivência de novos neurônios ; Environmental enrichment in laboratory animals is a housing condition that provides enhanced sensorial, motor and social stimulation as compared to maintenance in standard laboratory cages. It has been claimed that this kind of stimulation improves cognition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exposure to environmental enrichment on anxiety and aversive memory in the elevated plus maze, spatial working memory in the Morris\' water maze, and hippocampal neurogenesis. The animals were subjected to environmental enrichment from weaning (22 days) up to the last test (17 months). During this period, they were tested in the 3rd and 15th months of life in the elevated plus maze, and in the 9th and 16th months of life in the Morris\' water maze. A week before exposure to the water maze, the animals received an intraperitoneal injection of BrdU. Twenty-four hours and 30 days after the injection independent groups of animals were sacrificed for performing immunohistochemistry. Exposure to the enriched environment rendered young animals, but not elderly, less anxious. In addition, the aversive memory of both groups remained unchanged along aging. In the Morris\' water maze, animals exposed to the enriched environment showed a more effective searching strategy to find the hidden platform on the first trial than the controls, when tested at 9 months. In addition, the flexibility to deal with novel situations at 15 months was greater for animals exposed to the enriched environment. Even though, exposure to the enriched environment did not alter performance of spatial working memory. Environmental enrichment doubled hippocampal neurogenesis, and the survival of the new neurons was greater when the subjects were exposed to the Morris\' water maze task

AB  - In mammals, expression of fear is an adaptive trait that safeguards individuals from natural threats including predators. However, this expression can be exacerbated by chronic stress into manifestation of negative valence such as anxiety, leading to mental disorders. The potentiation of anxiety is primarily associated with neuronal changes in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Stress-induced hyperactivation of BLA in the form of dendritic reorganisation corresponds to precipitation of anxiety-states in adult male rats. This study shows that short-term environmental enrichment (EE) in adulthood is sufficient to counter anxiety-related pathologies induced by chronic stress. Stressed subjects housed in EE show lowered anxiety in contrast to those housed in standard-conditions. They differ in dendritic reorganization in the form of lowered spine-density compared to their stressed counterparts without EE. Furthermore, compared to the latter, the EE-exposed stressed animals also differ in protein-expression of activated glucocorticoid-receptors, and pro - brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which play an important role in mediating stress-response. These observations suggest that short-term EE can potentially cultivate resilience in adulthood against stress-induced pathologies at behavioural, neuronal, and molecular levels. ; Doctor of Philosophy (SBS)

AB  - Female mice are usually kept in non-enriched shoebox cages that increase agonism. I sought to understand why environmental enrichment (EE) reduces agonism by observing home-cage agonism, stereotypic behaviour, and inactive-but-awake behaviour (IBA: a depressive-like state), and by assessing hearing loss and anxiety, in 165 mice (C57BL/6s, BALB/cs, and DBA/2s). I employed statistics to see if any of these variables predicted agonism; only IBA did in some sub-groups. Low agonism in EE mice was also partially explained by low social interaction rates. Lastly, I assessed agonism in an unfamiliar arena with stranger mice, but enriched mice did not exhibit less agonism in this setting. Overall, these findings demonstrate that a) EE reduces agonism in females, b) IBA co-varies with agonism, c) low agonism is partially a by-product of low interaction rates, and d) enriched mice are no less agonistic than non-enriched mice when in an unfamiliar arena with strangers. ; GEES and OGS scholarships

AB  - Dietary N-3 PUFA plays a key role in brain maturation, development, stress response and cognitive abilities (Weiser et al., 2016; Devarshi et al., 2019). As adolescent’s prefrontal cortex is maturating, the period becomes sensitive to external factors such as environment, nutrition, and stress (Petrovich et al., 2001; Calabro et al., 2020). In this thesis, we aim to expand our knowledge of the influence of external factors, such as dietary omega-3 supplementation and enriched environment, during this critical maturation period. By designing four distinct studies, we tested the hypothesis that visible sex-specific alterations would arise from adolescence targeted diet n-3 PUFA supplementation and enriched environment, which would act to modify physiological and stress responses, as well as socio-emotional and cognitive performance. Our first study characterized the impact n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA regimen on corticosterone secretion and behavioural responses in adolescent male rodents. Additionally, it assessed the effects of delivery method (gavage versus restricted feeding) during this sensitive maturation period to ensure using a method with limited stress-mediated outcomes. This study highlighted gavage to induce reduced effects on corticosterone (CORT) secretion, regardless of the provided supplementation. On the last day of feeding, CORT secretion was diminished in fish oil (FO) fed rats exposed to restricted feeding, suggesting FO diet to promote physiological adjustments. Data also demonstrated that FO and soybean (CSO) rich diets were able to reduce anxiety-like behaviour compared to a high-fat diet intake (Hydrogenated Vegetal Fat - HVF), highlighting the role of n-3 PUFA dietary supplementation during adolescence on stress regulation. Our second study assessed sex-specific impact of adolescence targeted dietary supplementation on brain Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Arachidonic Acid (AA) and Linolenic acid (LA) concentrations immediately following supplementation and during adulthood.

AB  - Weaning introduces a multitude of stressors that negatively impact feed intake and can diminish gastrointestinal (GI) integrity which leads to increased disease susceptibility and altered gut function. Probiotics have been studied as an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters to enhance gut health. Furthermore, environmental enrichment has been shown to reduce the time spent in negative social interactions and increase feed intake in a stressful environment. The objective of this study was to determine effects of dietary probiotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) supplementation on weaning pig growth performance and oxidative stress, with and without environmental enrichment. The experiment was a 2 x 2 factorial design with 2 dietary treatments fed in nursery pens that did or did not include environmental enrichment. Weaned piglets (n=100 and 5pigs/pen; ~25.6 day of age) were allotted to the following dietary treatments: 1) control or 2) yeast probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.1% in phase 1 and 2 and 0.05% phase 3 diets) for 5-wks. On days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 35, pig weights, feed intake, fecal scores and blood samples were collected for monitoring diarrhea and measurement of oxidative stress markers. Pen weight (kg) was significantly increased over the five-week period. Pigs fed the basal diet had greater ADG (g) compared to pigs fed the probiotic supplemented diet (overall weeks 460.51 g vs 424.89 g, respectively P < 0.06). Pigs fed the probiotic diet tended to have more solid stool than pigs on the basal diet (P < 0.15). Oxidative stress marker diamine oxidase (DAO) fluctuated over the first 14 days of the nursery trial. There was a significant day effect from day 1, 7 and 14 post-weaning DAO (26.5, 18.3, and 22.1 ±1.4mg/mL respectively; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, probiotic supplementation did not enhance growth performance, but did tend to have improved stool consistency. The environmental enrichment used did not significantly impact growth or systemic oxidative stress. Overall, dietary supplementation and environmental enrichment did not improve weaning pig growth performance and oxidative stress markers in the study. ; No embargo ; Academic Major: Animal Sciences

AB  - Leptomeninges have been indicated as a novel neurogenic niche hosting neural stem cells (NSCs) able to generate neurons which can migrate and integrate into the brain cortex (Bifari et al. 2015; Bifari et al. 2009; Bifari et al. 2017; Decimo et al. 2011; Nakagomi et al. 2011; Pino et al. 2017). Nowadays, NSC populations are characterized by dynamic behaviour in response to environmental stimuli suggesting a possible role in physiologic and pathologic conditions (Decimo et al. 2012a; Decimo et al. 2020). In literature, is known that pro neurogenic paradigms such as EE and anti-depressant treatments affect hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the effect on meninges is still unexplored (David et al. 2009; Eisinger and Zhao 2018; Kempermann 2019). Furthermore, meninges are able to promptly respond also to neural pathological states (Lin et al. 2015; Nakagomi et al. 2011; Nakagomi et al. 2012; Ninomiya et al. 2013). In fact, it has been reported that the meningeal NSCs actively reacts to CNS insults (Dang et al. 2019; Decimo et al. 2011; Ninomiya et al. 2013). However, the specific role of meningeal NSCs in autoimmune disease is still unknown. The overall aim of my thesis was to investigate how meningeal niche can respond to neurogenic stimuli contributing to brain plasticity in physiological conditions and whether and how the meningeal NSC niche can be actively involved in response to autoinflammatory pathological stimuli. Enriched environment (EE), a particular housing condition which can offer enhanced sensory, cognitive or motor stimulation to the animal, and antidepressant treatment, are pro-neurogenic stimuli capable of increasing the number of newborn neurons in the DG of treated animals (Eisinger and Zhao 2018; Khodanovich et al. 2018). In the first part of the thesis, I characterized meningeal stem cell niche of young mice after exposure to EE and following administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant Fluoxetine.

AB  - O enriquecimento ambiental (EA) é capaz de alterar a percepção a estímulos nociceptivos, bem como de aumentar a resposta analgésica induzida por opioides. Considerando que a dor neuropática é um grave problema de saúde pública e o tratamento para esta condição ainda é insatisfatório e acarreta efeitos adversos severos, os objetivos deste trabalho foram avaliar a interferência do bem-estar animal na sensibilidade dolorosa de ratos frente a diferentes estímulos nociceptivos e investigar possíveis mecanismos envolvidos neste efeito. Os animais foram submetidos à avaliação da ansiedade e da sensibilidade dolorosa, em modelo de neuropática, frente a estímulos nociceptivos mecânicos e térmicos. Foi verificado que um protocolo de EA elaborado e iniciado desde o nascimento foi capaz de reverter totalmente a dor neuropática de animais submetidos à constrição crônica do nervo isquiático (CCI). Este efeito foi completamente abolido quando os animais enriquecidos foram tratados com naloxona, um antagonista opioide não seletivo. Análises de Western Blot não mostraram diferenças na expressão de receptores opioides em regiões relacionadas ao processamento e controle da dor, porém os níveis circulantes de beta-endorfina e met-encefalina aumentaram na presença de dor crônica nos animais enriquecidos. Os níveis séricos de corticosterona também se apresentaram aumentados nos animais com EA, independentemente da neuropatia, mas o tratamento com mifepristona, um antagonista de receptores de glicocorticoides, não alterou a analgesia dos animais operados. Ainda, o EA também reduziu a imunorreatividade para serotonina na medula espinal de animais com CCI. Além do efeito analgésico, o EA também reduziu o marcador de lesão neuronal ATF-3 no gânglio da raiz dorsal e, no local da constrição, reduziu a degeneração neuronal característica do modelo, induzindo ainda, a presença predominantemente de macrófagos do tipo M2. Este trabalho reforça a importância do bem-estar na prevenção do desenvolvimento da dor neuropática e mostra uma abordagem não farmacológica que pode aumentar a resiliência de animais contra estímulos nocivos. ; Environmental enrichment (EE) is capable of altering the perception of nociceptive stimuli, as well as increasing the analgesic response induced by opioids. Considering that neuropathic pain is a serious public health problem and the treatment for this condition is still unsatisfactory and induces severe side effects, the aims of this study were to evaluate the interference of animal welfare in the sensitivity to different nociceptive stimuli and to investigate possible mechanisms involved in this effect. Animals were submitted to the evaluation of anxiety and pain sensitivity in a model of neuropathic pain, against mechanical and thermal nociceptive stimuli. It was seen that an elaborated EE starting from birth was able to totally reverse the neuropathic pain of animals submitted to chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI). This effect was completely abolished when enriched animals were treated with naloxone, a nonselective opioid antagonist. Western blot analysis did not show differences in opioid receptor expression in regions related to pain processing and control, however, circulating levels of beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin were increased in the presence of chronic pain in enriched animals. Serum corticosterone levels were also increased in animals with EE regardless of neuropathy, but treatment with mifepristone, a nonselective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, did not alter the analgesia of operated animals. Moreover, EE reduced serotonin immunoreactivity in the spinal cord of CCI animals. In addition to analgesic effect, EE also reduced the neuronal injury marker ATF-3 at the dorsal root ganglia and, at the site of constriction, decreased the neuronal degeneration characteristic of the model, inducing the presence of M2 macrophages subtype predominantly. This work reinforces the importance of well-being in preventing the development of neuropathic pain and shows a non-pharmacological approach that may increase animal resilience against noxious stimuli.

AB  - O presente trabalho visou a estudar a relação entre o ambiente em que ratos se desenvolvem e a auto-administração de etanol (ET) na idade adulta. Usualmente, a pesquisa comportamental com animais em laboratório utiliza sujeitos mantidos isolados em caixas (I). Uma das espécies mais usadas é o rato, um animal social que em habitat natural vive em colônias. Tem sido proposto que a baixa disponibilidade de reforçadores alternativos é um dos fatores determinantes no abuso de drogas. O presente estudo visou comparar tratamentos comportamentais, i.e,. Reforçadores concorrentes, e tratamentos farmacológicos, i.e., ondansetrona, no consumo de ET nos ratos criados nos diferentes ambientes. Para tal, ratos Wistar machos foram criados em I ou em ambiente enriquecido (AE) e o comportamento de auto-administração do ET foi medido pelo desempenho sob um esquema concorrente VR-VR no qual uma alternativa dispensava uma solução de ET e a outra uma solução isocalórica ao ET. No primeiro experimento, a influência de reforçadores concorrentes no consumo de ET foi avaliada utilizando um delineamento experimental do tipo ABAB, com água ou solução isocalórica (maltodextrina- MALTO 14,8%) como concorrentes ao consumo de ET, alternadamente. A fim de estimar se diferenças nos níveis de ansiedade incondicionada eram responsáveis por diferenças no consumo de ET foi realizado um teste no labirinto em cruz elevada. Não houve diferença significativa entre os grupos. A fim de estudar os efeitos da ondansetrona, um bloqueador dos receptores de 5-HT3, que vem sendo relatado na literatura como eficaz em reduzir o consumo de ET em dependentes, mas apenas no subgrupo de início precoce, os animais criados em diferentes ambientes foram submetidos a um modelo concorrente de consumo. Primeiramente a introdução do ET foi realizada ao final da adolescência dos sujeitos, e a escolha por ET ou o concorrente foram avaliados em diferentes fases: concorrente isocalórico ou água reproduzindo o primeiro experimento, e houve diferenças significativas entre os grupos. Solução de MALTO 1% foi utilizada como concorrente ao ET para o teste da droga. Foram testadas duas doses da droga: 0,1mg/kg e 0,4 mg/kg. Foram conduzidos testes sem o uso de restrição alimentar e em abstinência de ET, em que apenas a sacarina 0,25% era apresentada. Paralelamente, foram realizadas coletas de fezes dos animais, durante as diversas fases do experimento a fim de estimar os níveis fecais do hormônio associado ao estresse corticosterona. Os sujeitos do grupo I consumiram e responderam significativamente mais pelo ET. A ondasetrona alterou o consumo de ET dos sujeitos apenas quando concorrente à MALTO 1%, de maneiras diferentes para os diversos sujeitos. A criação nos diferentes ambientes influencia a excreção de metabolitos fecais de corticosterona em função das fases experimentais ; The aim of the present work was to study the relation between the environment in which rats develop and the self-administration of ethanol (ET) during their adult life. Usually, behavior research using animals in laboratory is done with subjects kept in isolated (I) boxes. Rats are one of the most commonly used species and are social animals when in their natural habitat, living in colonies. It is proposed that low availability of alternative reinforcers is one of the key factors for drug abuse. The present work compared the effects of behavior treatments (i.e. concurrent reinforcers) and pharmacological treatments (i.e. ondansteron) in ET consumption by rats raised in two different types of environment. Male Wistar rats were reared in I or enriched environments (EE) and the behavior of ET self-administration was measured on a operant self-administration procedure using a VR-VR concurring schedule in which an alternative delivered an ET solution and the other, an isocaloric solution (maltodextrin - MALTO 14,8%). In the first experiment, the influence of concurrent reinforcers over the consumption of ET was measured using an ABAB design, with water or the isocaloric solution as alternative reinforcers each at a time. With the purpose of estimating if different levels of unconditioned anxiety were responsible for different levels of ET consumption, tests were conduced in an elevated plus maze. There were no significant differences between groups EE and I. On Experiment 2 the effects of ondasantron, an antagonist of 5-HT3 receptor that has been shown to reduce ET consumption on dependent human subjects, but only for early onset dependents, was evaluated. ET was introduced when subjects were in their late teens. The ET consumption and choice behavior of rats reared in EE or I were evaluated in a concurrent schedule. Isocaloric solution or water were delivered, reproducing Experiment 1 and significant differences emerged between groups. MALTO1% solution or water were then used as concurrents reinforcers to ET for the test using the drug. Two drug doses were tested: 0,1mg/kg and 0,4 mg/kg. Also, there were assessments made without alimentary restrictions and in ET abstinence: with sacarin 0,25% (VEI)as a reinforcer instead of ET solution. Feces samples were collected during the various phases of the experiment in order to estimate the fecal metabolites of the stress related hormone corticosteron. Subjects from group I consumed and responded significantly more for ET. Ondansetron altered ET consumption and choice behavior among subjects only when ET was delivered concurrently to MALTO 1%. Rearing in different environments influences the excretion of corticosteron fecal metabolites depending on the experimental phase. The presence of a concurrent reiforcer altered ET driven behavior and rearing in different environments (EE and I)influences ET consumption, ET choice behavior and corticosterone excretion

AB  - A retomada do consumo de etanol após abstinência é uma característica da dependência. O enriquecimento ambiental (EA) parece minimizar os efeitos de drogas de abuso, assim como a naltrexona (NTX). O estudo avaliou se EA, durante abstinência e associado ou não à NTX, alterou o consumo de etanol. Camundongos C57BL/6 foram expostos ao etanol 2h/dia. Após fase de aquisição, os animais foram separados em grupos. Os animais foram alojados em condições padrões e o outro em EA, 24h/dia ou 3h/dia. Após privação, os animais voltaram a ter acesso ao etanol semanalmente. Na última semana, tiveram acesso ao etanol por 24h e antes da reexposição foram submetidos ao estresse de contenção por 1h. Só neste caso, os grupos EA apresentaram uma redução no consumo de 24h. Ainda, outro experimento foi realizado associando o EA a baixas doses de NTX, mas não foram observadas alterações. Os resultados sugerem que o EA pode ajudar o animal a lidar melhor com o estresse, o que o protegeria de um comportamento de maior consumo de etanol. ; The excessive ethanol consumption after abstinence is a feature of addiction. Environmental enrichment (EE) appears to minimize drug cravings, as well as naltrexone (NTX). The study evaluated whether EE during abstinence and with or without NTX, altered ethanol consumption. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ethanol 2h/day. After an acquisition phase, mice were distributed into groups. The animals were housed in standard condition and the other in EE, 24h/day or 3h/day. After withdrawal, the animals returned to ethanol access weekly. On the last week, mice had access to ethanol for 24h and before re-exposure were subjected to restraint stress for 1h. EE groups decreased the ethanol consumption when mice had 24h free access to ethanol. Another experiment was performed with EE in association to low doses of NTX, but no differences in consumption were observed. The results suggests that EE may help the animal to cope better with stressful situations, resulting in blunted ethanol drinking.

AB  - Respostas adaptativas ao estresse podem ser acompanhadas por alterações nos comportamentos emocionais, em particular relacionados com medo e ansiedade, bem como alterações na sensibilidade dolorosa. Ainda, tem sido investigado o papel do óxido nítrico em áreas encefálicas relacionadas ao comportamento defensivo. Embora várias evidências têm demonstrado que o enriquecimento ambiental promove melhora nos processos de memória, no aprendizado e em respostas nociceptivas, a relação entre o estresse crônico e as vantagens da utilização do enriquecimento ambiental ainda são pouco investigadas. O presente estudo teve como objetivo investigar se o enriquecimento ambiental promove alteração do comportamento emocional, da sensibilidade nociceptiva, bem como na imunorreatividade à nNOS no núcleo central da amígdala, na formação hipocampal e na região dorsolateral da substância cinzenta periaquedutal, em ratos submetidos ao estresse por isolamento social ou estresse crônico variado e mantidos em ambiente enriquecido ou sem enriquecimento. Ratos machos Wistar (~70g) foram divididos aleatoriamente em dois grandes grupos experimentais: Ambiente Padrão (Padrão) ou Ambiente Enriquecido (EE), mantidos por 38 dias. Cada grupo foi subdividido dependendo do tipo de estresse crônico: Controle (sem estresse), Isolamento Social (por 38 dias) e Estresse Crônico Variado (do dia 28 ao dia 37). Ao fim do tempo experimental (dia 38) os ratos foram avaliados quanto ao comportamento emocional pelos testes de labirinto em cruz elevado (LCE) e claro/escuro (TCE) e sensibilidade nociceptiva pelo teste da placa quente (a qual foi realizada em duas etapas, sendo a primeira medida no dia 0 e outra no dia 38). A eutanásia dos ratos ocorreu no dia 39, para coleta do encéfalo para análise da imunorreatividade à óxido nítrico sintase neuronal (nNOS). Levando-se em consideração o comportamento emocional e a sensibilidade nociceptiva, os diferentes tipos de estresse crônico diminuíram a porcentagem de tempo, a frequência de entrada e a exploração da extremidade dos braços abertos e na frequência de mergulho de cabeça no teste do LCE, apesar de não alterar a sensibilidade nociceptiva. Por outro lado, o enriquecimento ambiental aumentou a porcentagem de tempo, a frequência de entrada e a exploração da extremidade dos braços abertos no teste do LCE, apesar de não alterar a sensibilidade nociceptiva. Foi observado aumento da imunorreatividade à nNOS na formação hipocampal em diferentes tipos de estresse crônico. Em particular, na região de CA3 houve interação significante entre os fatores estresse por isolamento social e ambiente de manutenção. Deste modo, os resultados obtidos neste trabalho sugerem que a formação hipocampal desempenha importante função no efeito ansiogênico exercido pelos diferentes tipos de estressores crônicos (aqui representados pelo isolamento social e pelo estresse crônico variado) provavelmente pela ativação do sistema nitrérgico e sugere-se que o enriquecimento possa prevenir o comportamento do tipo ansioso. ; Adaptive responses to stress may be accompanied by changes in emotional behaviors, in particular related to fear and anxiety, as well as changes in pain sensitivity. Furthermore, the role of nitric oxide in brain areas related to defensive behavior has been investigated. Although several evidences have shown that environmental enrichment improves memory processes, learning and nociceptive responses, the relationship between chronic stress and the advantages of using environmental enrichment is still poorly investigated. The present study aimed to investigate whether environmental enrichment promotes alteration of the emotional behavior, nociceptive sensitivity, as well as immunoreactivity to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the central nucleus of the amygdala, hippocampal formation and dorsolateral periaqueductal gray matter in rats submitted to social isolation stress or chronic unpredictable stress and reared in enriched environment or standard environment. Male Wistar rats (~ 70g) were randomly divided into two major experimental groups: Standard Environment (Standard) or Enriched Environment (EE), maintained for 38 days. Each group was subdivided according to the type of chronic stress: Control (without stress), Social Isolation (for 38 days) and Chronic Unpredictable Stress (from day 28 to day 37). At the end of the experimental time (day 38), the rats were evaluated for emotional behavior by elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark box (LDBT) tests and nociceptive sensitivity by the hot plate test (which was performed in two steps , the first being measured on day 0 and the other on day 38). Euthanasia of rats occurred on day 39, to collect the brain for nNOS immunoreactivity analysis. Taking into account emotional behavior and nociceptive sensitivity, the different types of chronic stress decreased the percentage of time, the frequency of entry of the open arms, end-arm exploration and the head dipping frequency in the EPM, despite of not altering the nociceptive sensitivity. On the other hand, environmental enrichment increased the percentage of time, the frequency of entry of the open arms and the end arm-exploration in the EPM test, although it did not alter the nociceptive sensitivity. Increased immunoreactivity to nNOS in hippocampal formation was observed in different types of chronic stress. In particular, in the CA3 region there was a significant interaction between stress factors due to social isolation and maintenance environment. Thus, the results obtained in this study suggest that hippocampal formation plays an important role in the anxiogenic effect exerted by the different types of chronic stressors (represented here by social isolation and by chronic chronic stress) probably due to the activation of the nitrergic system and it is suggested that environmental enrichment can prevent of anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - O comportamento de doença é um conjunto de alterações comportamentais adaptativas que preparam o organismo para lidar com infecções virais e bacterianas desencadeadas no sistema nervoso central pela ação de citocinas pró-inflamatórias. Esse conjunto de mudanças incluem aumento na temperatura corporal, atividade motora e exploratória reduzida e comportamento semelhante à ansiedade. Estudos mostram que o enriquecimento ambiental (AE) pode alterar respostas emocionais e nociceptivas em indivíduos saudáveis, mas ainda não há estudos com indivíduos que passam por uma infeção. O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar se o AE altera o comportamento semelhante à ansiedade induzido por endotoxina bacteriana (Lipopolissacarídeos, LPS). Para isso, ratos Wistar Hannover, machos e adultos (CEUA-USP # 18.1.1630.59.7) foram mantidos por aproximadamente 5 semanas em ambiente padrão (AP) ou enriquecido (AE). No 38º dia experimental, os ratos foram submetidos à administração de LPS (200 µg/kg) ou salina estéril (SAL 0,9%) via ip. A temperatura corporal foi avaliada pela temperatura da cauda (TC), antes e a cada 30 min, durante 180 minutos após os tratamentos. O comportamento emocional foi analisado no labirinto em cruz elevado (LCE) e pelo teste de vocalização ultrassônica (VUS). A atividade motora foi avaliada pelo teste rotarod e campo aberto 3 h após a injeção de LPS ou SAL. A ANOVA foi utilizada para avaliação estatística, seguida pelo teste de Tukey ou Bonferroni (p < 0,05). No término dos experimentos, os animais foram submetidos à eutanásia por meio de sobredose anestésica com cloridrato de cetamina 10% (225 mg/kg) e cloridrato de xilazina 2% (30 mg/kg) via i.p., sendo o encéfalo e sangue coletados para posterior análise imunoistoquímica e dosagem de citocinas, respectivamente. Os resultados mostraram redução da TC após 120 min da injeção de LPS (teste de Tukey; p < 0,05), o que indica estado febril independente do tipo de ambiente em que os animais foram mantidos (AP+LPS e AE+LPS). Em um grupo independente foi realizada a dosagem de citocinas plasmáticas, no qual foi constatado que a administração de LPS induziu aumento das citocinas TNF-α, IL-1β e IL-6 quando comparado com os grupos controle que receberam SAL, independente do tipo de ambiente em que foram mantidos. Quando observamos TNF-α, observamos os grupos que foram submetidos a administração de LPS, observamos que os animais que foram mantidos no AE apresentaram uma menor produção desta citocina, o que demonstra uma menor resposta inflamatória quando comparado com aqueles mantidos em AP. A análise comportamental mostra que o LPS induziu comportamento semelhante à ansiedade independente do ambiente, uma vez que o número de entradas nos braços abertos no teste LCE foi reduzido no grupo AP+LPS, bem como no AE+LPS quando comparado com AP+SAL e AE+SAL (p < 0,05, Tukey). Além disso, observou-se redução do número de entradas nos braços abertos (BA), do comportamento de avaliação de risco e do mergulho de cabeça dos animais que receberam o LPS. A aplicação da ANOVA revelou que há diferença significativa considerando o número de entradas nos BA quando comparados os grupos LPS com os respectivos grupos controles (AP/SAL e AE/SAL). Com relação ao teste do campo aberto, a análise da atividade locomotora (número total de quadrados percorridos no tempo de 5 min) mostra que há diminuição do número de quadrados percorridos nos grupos LPS. No teste do rotarod, a administração de LPS promoveu redução do tempo de permanência no teste nos animais mantidos em AP. Entretanto, os animais mantidos em AE, a endotoxemia não promoveu alteração no parâmetro analisado. Quanto à VUS, os dados mostram que a administração do LPS induz a vocalização na frequência compreendia entre 18-33KHz, considerada aversiva e indicativo da presença de altos níveis de ansiedade e medo. Destaca-se que o grupo mantido em AE observou-se redução da emissão da VUS na faixa aversiva, mas não diferiu do grupos AP/LPS. A análise da expressão da proteína FOS (c-fos), evidencia que a administração de LPS promove maior marcação de células imunopositivas na região basolateral da amígdala de animais mantidos em AP do que a observada em animais mantidos em AE, mesmo que ainda não seja encontrada diferença estatística (p > 0,05) quando comparado com grupos que receberam SAL. Os resultados deste estudo permitem concluir que o ambiente enriquecido atenua parcialmente as respostas relacionadas à ansiedade em decorrência da inflamação sistêmica promovida pela administração de LPS. Entretanto, destaca-se que o enriquecimento ambiental não interfere com a resposta febril ou imunológica associada à endotoxemia. ; Sickness behavior is a set of adaptive behavioral changes that prepare the body to deal with viral and bacterial infections triggered in the central nervous system by the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These behavioral changes included increased body temperature, reduced motor and exploratory activity, and anxiety-like behavior. Studies show that environmental enrichment (EE) can alter emotional and nociceptive responses in healthy individuals, but there are no studies on individuals who experience an infection. This study investigated whether EE alters the anxiety-like behavior induced by bacterial endotoxin (Lipopolysaccharides, LPS). For this purpose, male and adult Wistar Hannover rats (CEUA-USP # 18.1.1630.59.7) were kept for four weeks in a standard (SE) or enriched (EE) environment. On the 38th experimental day, the rats were submitted to the administration of LPS (200 µg/kg) or sterile saline (SAL, 0.9%) via IP. Body temperature was assessed by tail temperature (TT) before and each 30 min. for 180 minutes after treatments. Emotional behavior was analyzed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM), and motor activity was assessed by rotarod test and open field three hours after LPS or SAL injection. ANOVA was used for statistical evaluation, followed by the Tukey test (p < 0.05). The animals were euthanized at the end of the experiments (anesthetic overdose with 10% ketamine hydrochloride, 225 mg/kg, and 2% xylazine hydrochloride, 30 mg/kg i.p.), and the brain and blood were collected for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis and cytokine dosage, respectively. The results showed a reduction in TC 120 min after LPS injection (Tukey\'s test; p < 0.05), which indicates a febrile state regardless of the type of environment in which the animals were kept (SE +LPS and EE+LPS). Regarding plasma cytokines, LPS administration induced an increase in TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 cytokines compared to control groups that received SAL, regardless of the environment in which they were kept. The TNF-α analysis showed that the groups submitted to LPS administration and kept in the EE presented lower production of this cytokine. Behavioral analysis shows that LPS induced anxiety-like behavior independent of the environment since the number of open-arm entries in the EPM test was reduced in the SE+LPS group, as well as in the EE+LPS when compared to SE+SAL and EE+SAL (p < 0.05, Tukey). In addition, there was a reduction in the number of entries into the open arms (OA), risk assessment behavior, and head dipping in animals that received LPS. The ANOVA statistics revealed a significant difference considering the number of entries in the BA when comparing the LPS groups with the respective control groups (SE/SAL and EE/SAL). Regarding the open field test, the analysis of locomotor activity (total number of squares covered in a 5 min) shows a decrease in the number of squares covered in the LPS groups. In the rotarod test, the administration of LPS reduced the permanence time in the test in animals kept in SE. However, in animals kept in EE, endotoxemia did not change the analyzed parameter. As for VUS, the data show that the administration of LPS induces vocalization at a frequency ranging between 18-33KHz, considered aversive and indicative of the presence of high levels of anxiety and fear. It is noteworthy that the group kept in AE showed a reduction in VUS emission in the aversive range, but it did not differ from the SE/LPS groups. The analysis of FOS protein expression (c-fos) showed that the administration of LPS promoted greater labeling of immunopositive cells in the basolateral region of the tonsils of animals kept in SE than that observed in animals kept in EE, even though no statistical difference has yet been found (p > 0.05) when compared to groups that received SAL. The results of this study allow us to conclude that the enriched environment partially attenuates the anxiety-related responses due to the systemic inflammation promoted by the administration of LPS. However, it is noteworthy that environmental enrichment does not interfere with the febrile or immunological response associated with endotoxemia.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has a variety of positive cognitive effects and the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) is in an optimal location for orchestrating translational changes in response to altered neuronal activity. It has been seen that the kinase function of MSK1 is necessary for regulating basal synaptic transmission strength, increasing mEPSCs amplitude after EE and for allowing cognitive flexibility. Changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression, particularly at the cell surface, is one possible explanation for MSK1- and EE- dependent effects on synaptic transmission. In this thesis, I have compared wild-type mice and mice containing an inactive form of MSK1 (MSK1 KD), raised under either standard or EE conditions. After 3 months of EE, significant interactions between housing and genotype were identified in the AMPAR subunit GluA2, alongside two plasticity-related immediate early genes (IEGs), Arc and EGR1. This homeostatic regulation of IEG transcription corroborated what has previously been identified at the RNA level and these changes may reflect the alterations seen previously at the electrophysiological level. Using electron microscopy, I discovered that under basal conditions, the PSD length is shorter in MSK1 KD animals, suggestive of reduced protein accumulation at the post-synaptic membrane. I also performed behavioural studies and identified MSK1 KD animals to have significantly reduced exploratory behaviour and improved spatial working memory, which may reflect the underlying behavioural trait for the impairment in cognitive flexibility. These studies provide new insights into the role that MSK1 plays in regulating key-plasticity related proteins and ultrastructural alterations and provides further clarity of the molecular pathways linking the long-lasting enrichmentinduced alterations underpinning cognitive and behavioural adaptations. Greater understanding of this pathway could provide new therapeutic avenues for patients with cognitive impairments.

AB  - O etanol é a droga de abuso mais consumida em todo o mundo. Frequentemente, há comorbidade entre o alcoolismo e transtornos relacionados ao estresse. O enriquecimento ambiental (EA) reduz o comportamento ansioso em resposta ao estresse e consequentemente minimiza os efeitos reforçadores de drogas de abuso. Como o enriquecimento induz interações sociais, deve promover a liberação de oxitocina (OT), um neuropeptídeo liberado em resposta a experiências sociais. A OT tem propriedades ansiolíticas que devem conferir proteção aos efeitos deletérios do estresse. Neste trabalho, verificamos se o EA ou a OT protegem contra o consumo de etanol em camundongos machos C57BL/6, mesmo após a exposição ao estresse de exposição ao predador, um modelo de transtorno de estresse pós traumático (TEPT). Para avaliar os efeitos do EA, os animais foram divididos entre caixas padrão (NE) e caixas enriquecidas (EA) após a fase de aquisição, onde permaneceram por 21 dias. Em seguida foram subdivididos em grupos não estressados (NENS e EANS) e estressados (NEST e EAST) e reexpostos novamente ao etanol por 24h após o estresse; após 7 dias, com avaliação do comportamento do tipo ansioso por Labirinto em Cruz Elevado; e após 14 dias do estresse, quando passaram pela Caixa Claro-Escuro. Dentre os animais estressados, EAST reduziu o consumo e exibiu menos comportamento de medo e ansiedade. Em outro experimento, verificamos os efeitos de diferentes doses de carbetocina (CBT), um análogo da OT, sobre a ingestão de álcool. Então, foi realizado o tratamento crônico com CBT em camundongos, sendo que um grupo recebeu salina (CTL), outro recebeu CBT 1h antes das reexposições (CBT1h) e o último recebeu CBT 16h antes das reexposições ao etanol (CBT16h). Os animais passaram pelo mesmo delineamento do experimento anterior. A CBT1h teve efeito protetor sobre o consumo de álcool após estresse, enquanto a CBT16h não. ; Ethanol is the most commonly abused drug. Comorbidity between alcoholism and stress related disorders is highly frequent. Environmental enrichment (EE) reduces anxiety-like behaviour and consequently minimizes reinforcing effects of abused drugs. As EE favours social interactions, it might promote oxytocin (OT) release. OT is a neuropeptide secreted after social experiences. It is also related that OT has anxiolytic properties, which confers protection against stress maladaptive effects. The purpose of this work was to check if EE or OT protect against ethanol intake in male C57BL/6 abstinent mice even after stress exposure. To evaluate EE effects, animal were divided between standard housing (NE) and enriched housing (EA) after acquisition for 21 days. Then, both groups were subdivided into non-stressed (NENS, EANS) and stressed (NEST, EAST) and were submitted to predator exposure stress, a model of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Right after stress, animals were reexposed to ethanol for 24h; after 7 days, when anxiety-like behaviour was evaluated by Elevated Plus Maze; and after 14 days of stress, when their behaviour was assessed by Light Dark Box. Among stressed animals, EAST reduced ethanol intake and exhibited decreased anxiety-like behaviour and fear. We determined the effects of different doses of carbetocin (CBT) on alcohol intake. In another experiment, mice were chronically treated CBT, an OT analogue. Control mice received saline (CTL), CBT1h were treated 1 hour before ethanol reexposure and CBT16h were treated 16 hours before reexposures. The protocol was the same of the first experiment. CBT1h protected against ethanol intake after stress, while CBT16h did not. These results show that EE buffers ethanol. CBT reduced ethanol consumption when it was administered immediately before stress.

AB  - Esta pesquisa estuda a relação entre o ambiente em que ratos se desenvolvem e a auto-administração de etanol (ET) na idade adulta. Usualmente, a pesquisa comportamental com animais em laboratório utiliza sujeitos mantidos em isolamento em caixas individuasi (I). Uma das espécies mais usadas é o rato, um animal social que em habitat natural vive em colônias. Que efeitos tem o isolamento nesses ratos? Propõe-se que a baixa disponibilidade de reforçadores alternativos seja um dos fatores determinantes do abuso de drogas. Algumas pesquisas mostraram que o isolamento, que caracteriza ambientes de baixa disponibilidade de reforçadores, leva a um aumento no consumo de morfina, anfetamina e barbital em relação a ratos criados em ambientes com maior disponibilidade de reforçadores (AE), e mais ET comparados a animais criados em grupo. No entanto, outras pesquisas observaram que animais criados em AE consomem mais ET do que animais criados em isolamento. Utilizando medidas de comportamento operante de ingestão de ET, o presente experimento visou observar se a disponibilidade de reforçadores no ambiente de criação e/ou concorrentes ao álcool no ambiente experimental altera o consumo, o valor reforçador e a elasticidade da demanda dessa droga. Ratos Wistar machos foram criados em I ou em AE. O consumo e o valor reforçador do ET foram medidos nos esquemas operantes de FR2 e Razão Progressiva (RP), respectivamente. O ET foi introduzido por fade in/fade out de sacarose, culminando numa solução de ET 10% adoçada com sacarina 0,25%. O teste de RP foi conduzido para solução de ET, depois para sacarina. Os animais foram submetidos também ao teste de ansiedade no labirinto em cruz elevado e sua atividade motora foi estimada em caixa de atividade. Os ratos I consumiram e responderam significativamente mais pelo ET comparados aos ratos AE. Os ratos I evidenciaram aumento do valor reforçador do ET, mas não da sacarina, medido em RP, quando comparados aos do grupo AE. Os grupos AE e I não apresentaram diferenças significativas em ansiedade. Os animais do grupo I mostraram-se significativamente mais ativos do que os do grupo AE. A elasticidade da demanda foi medida em um modelo concorrente no qual uma alternativa dispensava solução de ET e a outra uma solução isocalórica ao ET, e as exigências em VR foram aumentadas progressivamente, primeiro para a alternativa isocalórica, e depois para o ET. A introdução de reforçadores concorrentes alterou o consumo de ET dos animais criados em I sem alterar o comportamento dos animais criados em AE. A criação nos diferentes ambientes não alterou a elasticidade da demanda por ET, porém alterou a elasticidade da demanda pelo reforçador concorrente. Os animais do grupo I, apesar de consumirem significativamente mais da solução alternativa ao ET, apresentaram uma demanda mais elástica em relação a esse reforçador quando comparados aos do grupo AE. A dependência de drogas, e do álcool em especial, pode e deve ser entendida dentro das mesmas leis que regulam o comportamento em geral, e os modelos de escolha são essenciais para essa compreensão. ; This research investigated the influence of different types of rearing environment on ethanol (ET) self-administration in adult rats. Usually behavioral research is conducted using isolated animals (I), one widely used animal is the rat, a social animal that under normal circumstances lives at large colonies. What kind of effects could this unnatural isolation have? It has been proposed that one major factor in drug abuse and dependence is the lack for alternative reinforcers to the drug. Animals raised in limited environments with few reinforcers (I) consume more morphine, amphetamine and barbital than animals raised in enriched environments (EE), which present different opportunities of behavior. These isolated rats have also been shown to consume more ET; however, there are some contradictory results within studies: some have even shown enhanced consumption in EE rats. The present study proposed to investigate whether differential presence of reinforcers during rearing or concurrently to the presentation of ET would influence its consumption, reiforcer value and demand elasticity. Male Wistar rats were raised either in EE or I. Using a self administration paradigm, consumption and reiforcer value were estimated in a FR2 and Progressive Ratio (PR), respectively. ET was introduced by fade in as sucrose was faded out from the solution, resulting in a 10% ET solution sweetened with saccharin 0,25% as the reinforcer solution. The PR procedure was first conducted using the ET solution and then with just the saccharin solution (vehicle). Anxiety was estimated using the elevated cross maze model, and motor activity was accessed in the activity box. I rats consumed and responded more for ET than EE rats in FR2 schedule. They also presented higher reiforcer value for ET in the PR paradigm, but not for saccharin, when compared to EE rats. There was no significant difference between groups in anxiety levels, but I rats were significantly more active. Using a concurrent model, with ET solution and an isochaloric solution as reiforcers, the demand elasticity was accessed by increasingly VRs, first for the isochaloric alternative, then for the ET solution. The introduction of an isochaloric concurrent reiforcer altered ET consumption of I rats, without affecting EE rats consumption. Groups did not differ in demand elasticity for ET, but it was shown that this demand is relatively inelastic while demand for the isochaloric solution is very elastic, especially for I rats, though. I rats consumed more isochaloric solutions than EE rats. Drug abuse and dependency must be understood using the same laws that regulate so called normal behavior, these phenomena do not belong to a special category, and choice models are essential for that understanding.

AB  - O enriquecimento ambiental (EA) é um modelo experimental capaz de promover a melhora no aprendizado e na formação de memórias hipocampo-dependentes, bem como a redução de manifestações comportamentais relacionadas ao estresse, incluindo a ansiedade. Embora a relação causal entre estresse e ansiedade ainda não está esclarecida, algumas evidências apontem para a importância da sinalização de hormônios glicocorticoides (via receptores GR e MR) no sistema nervoso central, principalmente na amígdala e no hipocampo, além do fator neurotrófico BDNF e de algumas vias de sinalização intracelular, como proteínas quinases MAPK e o fator de transcrição CREB. No presente trabalho verificamos que o EA previne o surgimento de sintomas do tipo ansioso desencadeado por estresse agudo em ratos, efeito verificado imediatamente após o estresse, e que tal efeito pode estar relacionado à modulação, no complexo amigdalóide basolateral, da sinalização nuclear de GR, da atividade de ERK (pertencente à família das MAPK) e de CREB, bem como à alteração na expressão do receptor de BDNF. ; Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental model that promotes improvements in learning and memory, as well as reduction in stress-induced behaviors, including anxiety. Although the casual relationship between stress and anxiety remains unclear, some studies show the importance of glucocorticoids hormones signaling (via GR and MR receptors) in the central nervous system, primarily in the amygdala and the hippocampus. In addition, the significance of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and some intracellular signaling pathways, such as protein kinases MAPK and the transcription factor CREB, has been described. In this study we found that EE prevents the emergence of anxiety-related behavior triggered by acute stress in rats, an effect observed just after the stress stimulus. This effect may be related to the modulation, in the basolateral amygdala, of nuclear GR signaling, ERK (a MAPK protein) and CREB activity, as well as to changes in the expression of BDNF receptor.

AB  - As consequências de eventos estressantes sobre a saúde humana, principalmente relacionada à condição psiquiátrica, tem ganhado notoriedade nos últimos anos em decorrência do crescente número de comorbidades associadas ao estresse registradas nas grandes cidades. Transtornos emocionais relacionados a sintomas de ansiedade são comuns dentre os relatados na clínica psiquiátrica e ganham importância em trabalhos científicos devotados ao estresse, que lançam mão de abordagens diversas para compreender os mecanismos neurobiológicos subjacentes à a persistência de sintomas ansiosos decorrentes de um evento estressante. Trabalhos prévios mostraram que tanto o estresse agudo de contenção quanto a administração sistêmica de corticosterona (CORT, hormônio glicocorticoide murino) promovem, 10 dias depois, comportamento do tipo ansioso e remodelamento dendrítico no complexo basolateral da amígdala (BLA) em ratos. Além disso, alguns trabalhos recentes mostraram que a exposição ao enriquecimento ambiental (EA) reverteu o efeito ansiogênico e sobre a modulação dendrítica do BLA induzidos por estresse repetido. Em trabalho recente, nós verificamos que o EA preveniu o efeito ansiogênico imediato do estresse agudo de contenção. Esse efeito protetor do EA pareceu estar relacionado a seu efeito preventivo no aumento da atividade neuronal e do receptor de glicocorticoide (GR) no BLA. No presente trabalho, nós verificamos que o EA preveniu tanto o surgimento do comportamento do tipo ansioso quanto o déficit de extinção da memória de medo induzidos por estresse agudo de contenção verificados 10 dias depois. Porém, não está claro se esses efeitos estão relacionados com alterações na árvore dendrítica do BLA e/ou com a atividade de GR no mesmo núcleo. Dessa forma, um dos objetivos centrais do trabalho foi determinar se o efeito preventivo do EA na persistência das alterações comportamentais, e nas alterações morfológicos no BLA, induzidas por estresse agudo, são atribuidas às ações de CORT. Nós observamos que o efeito preventivo do EA na ansiedade e no déficit de extinção, verificados 10 dias após o estresse, não estão relacionados à prevenção no aumento da densidade de espinhos dendríticos do BLA. Além disso, ainibição da síntese de CORT por metirapona preveniu a emergência do comportamento do tipo ansioso 10 dias após o estresse, indicando que a sinalização desse hormônio é crucial para os efeitos comportamentais tardios relacionados ao estresse agudo. Finalmente, lançando mão do uso da tecnologia do DNA recombinante, nós verificamos que a inibição da atividade genômicoa de GR no BLA preveniu o comportamento do tipo ansioso manifestado 10 dias após o estresse. ; The consequences of stressful events on human health, especially related to psychiatric disorders, have gained attention in recent years due the increasing number of comorbidities associated to stress in large cities. Anxiety-related disorders are common among the psychiatric patients and are widely present in studies devoted to stress, which use different approaches to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the persistence of anxiety symptoms caused by a stressful event. Either acute restraint stress or systemic injection of corticosterone (CORT, a rodent glucocorticoid) in rats leads to enhanced anxiety-like behavior and dendritic branch remodeling in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) 10 days later. Also, some studies showed that exposure to environmental enrichment (EE) reverted the long- lasting anxiety-like behavior and the repeated stress-induced BLA dendritic hypertrophy in rats. In a recent study, we found that EE prevented anxiety-related behavior in adult rats observed immediately after acute restraint stress. This protective role of EE appears to be due to the prevention of the stress-induced increase in neuronal activity and in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear activity in the BLA. In this study, we showed that EE prevented the restraint stress-induced long-lasting anxiety and contextual fear extinction impairment in adult rats. However, it is not yet clear if this protective role of EE is related to changes in the dendritic branch and/or in the GR signaling in the BLA. The present study sought to determine whether the preventive effect of EE on persistent stress-related changes in behavior as well as in the BLA morphology and activity are attributed to CORT signaling. We found that the EE- induced protection on anxiety-like behavior and fear extinction impairment 10 days after acute restraint stress was not related to prevention of the increase in spine density in BLA. Moreover, systemic injection of GC synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone) prevented the anxiety-like behavior 10 days after stress, showing that GC signaling during stress is crucial to late stress-related behavior. Finally, by antagonizing the genomic signaling of the endogenous GR in the BLA, through the use of recombinant DNA technology, we prevented the emergence of anxiety-related behavior 10 days after acute stress.

AB  - O desenvolvimento humano pode ser influenciado pelo ambiente. Estímulos recebidos ao longo da vida determinam seu progresso e sucesso. Estímulos positivos levam ao desenvolvimento de habilidades, melhorando funções cognitivas e da memória, enquanto estímulos negativos podem predispor a patologias como o estresse. Eventos estressantes durante a infância aumentam a predisposição para o desenvolvimento de transtornos psiquiátricos ao longo da vida. A separação materna, modelo animal de estresse pós-natal, promove diversas alterações comportamentais e encefálicas. Animais submetidos à separação materna apresentam comportamentos que mimetizam doenças psiquiátricas humanas. Por outro lado, diversos trabalhos sugerem que o enriquecimento ambiental pode ter efeito benéfico na reversão ou atenuação de modificações comportamentais e encefálicas promovidas por modelos animais de depressão, esquizofrenia, ansiedade e hiperatividade. Esses aspectos motivaram-nos a estudar se as alterações causadas por estresse podem ser revertidas ou atenuadas pelo enriquecimento do ambiente. Há evidências que sugerem um importante envolvimento de células gliais e de transportadores de glutamato presentes nessas células em modelos animais de transtornos psiquiátricos. Sendo assim, investigamos a expressão de mRNA e proteínas de dois transportadores de glutamato gliais e um neuronal, do receptor de glutamato AMPA, de marcadores gliais GFAP, S100?, glutamina sintase (GS) e do marcador de neurônios maduros NeuN na camada molecular e granular do giro denteado do hipocampo de ratos de 60 dias. Observamos que a separação materna diminui a expressão das proteínas GLAST, GLT-1, GS e NeuN, reduz a expressão dos genes Gria1 (AMPA) e S100?, e aumenta a expressão da proteína EAAC1 no giro denteado. Nossos dados sugerem uma reversão das alterações causadas pela separação materna em relação ao gene Gria1/AMPA e às proteínas GLAST, GLT-1 e EAAC1 após o enriquecimento ambiental. Portanto, o enriquecimento ambiental pode reverter as modificações causadas pela separação materna nas vias glutamatérgicas. Esses efeitos benéficos podem ser investigados para auxiliar no tratamento de transtornos psiquiátricos relacionados à separação materna. ; Human development can be influenced by the environment. Stimuli received throughout life determine its progress and success. Positive stimuli lead to development of skills, improving cognitive and memory functions, while negative stimuli may predispose to pathologies such as stress. Stressful events during childhood increase the predisposition to psychiatric disorders throughout life. Maternal separation, an animal model of postnatal stress, promotes several behavioral and encephalic changes. Animals submitted to maternal separation stage behaviors associated with psychiatric diseases in humans. On the other hand, some researches have suggested that environmental enrichment may have some beneficial effects on the reversal or attenuation of behavioral and encephalic modifications promoted by animal models of depression, schizophrenia, anxiety and hyperactivity, which motivates us to study if these changes, stirred by this kind of stress, can be reversed or mitigated by environmental enrichment. There are evidences suggesting the involvement of glial cells and glutamate transporters existent in these cells in psychiatric disorders and animal models of these disorders. Therefore, we investigated mRNA and protein expression of two glial and one neuronal glutamate transporters, AMPA glutamate receptor, glial markers GFAP, S100?, glutamine synthase (GS), and the NeuN neuronal marker in the molecular and granular layer of the hippocampal gyrus in sixty-days-old rats. We observed that maternal separation decreases expression of GLAST, GLT-1, GS and NeuN proteins, reduces Gria1 (AMPA) and S100? gene expression, and increases EAAC1 protein expression in the dentate gyrus. After environmental enrichment, our data suggests a reversal of the maternal separation changes in the Gria1/AMPA gene and the GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAC1 proteins. Therefore, environmental enrichment may reverse the maternal separation changes in the glutamatergic pathways. These beneficial effects may be investigated to aid in the treatment of psychiatric disorders related to maternal separation.

AB  - A maioria dos estudos explora o enriquecimento ambiental (EA) como uma forma de estudar o comportamento do animal, função cerebral e memória. Além disso, o EA pode estimular a atividade física voluntária. No entanto, pouco se sabe sobre o impacto deste estímulo sobre o perfil de estresse oxidativo no coração, assim como nos parâmetros cardiometabólicos. O objetivo do presente estudo é verificar os efeitos da atividade física voluntária sobre os parâmetros cardiometabólicos e sobre o perfil de estresse oxidativo no coração e músculo sóleo de ratos jovens e velhos. Foram utilizados 32 ratos, machos, Wistar, separados em 4 grupos: jovens controle (JC), jovens com enriquecimento ambiental (JEA), velhos controle (VC), velhos com enriquecimento ambiental (VEA). Os animais foram mantidos em seus grupos por 6 semanas, sendo que após esse período todos os animais foram avaliados (teste de esforço, peso, glicemia). Os resultados demonstraram alterações na composição corporal: aumento da gordura marrom no grupo VEA comparado ao grupo VC e redução da gordura periepididimal no grupo VEA comparado ao grupo VC. Houve também uma melhora no desempenho físico (tempo de corrida e velocidade) observado no teste de esforço do grupo VE comparado ao VC. A enzima citrato sintase é menor no VC comparado ao JC, sendo que o EA faz desaparecer essa diferença, deixando o grupo VEA semelhante ao JEA. Em relação ao perfil de estresse oxidativo, houve redução dos pró-oxidantes no grupo JEA tanto no coração quanto no músculo sóleo; já no grupo VEA houve aumento da enzima antioxidante superóxido dismutase (SOD) e foi possível observar uma tendência de aumento na glutationa peroxidase (Gpx). O EA é capaz de alterar a composição corporal, melhorar a performance e aumentar a SOD no grupo de ratos velhos. No grupo de ratos jovens reduz o dano oxidativo tanto no músculo sóleo quanto no coração, mas não provoca adaptações relevantes no sistema de defesa antioxidante enzimático ; Most studies exploring environmental enrichment (EE) as a way to study the animal\'s behavior, brain function and memory. In addition the EE can stimulate voluntary physical activity however, little is known about the impact of stimulus Profile oxidative stress in the heart, as in cardiometabolic parameters. The aim of this study was to access the effects of voluntary physical activity (EE) on cardiometabolic parameters and the oxidative stress profile in soleus muscle and heart of young and old male rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups: young control (YC), young environmental enrichment (YE), old control (OC), old environmental enrichment (OE). After six weeks, the weight, stress test and blood glucose were evaluated in all groups. The data showed body composition changes: increased in the brown fat in OE group (0.072 ± 0.032) compared to OC group (0.051 ± 0.012); and reduced fat periepydidimal in OEA group (1.25 ± 0.48) compared to OC group (1.87 ± 0.63). We also observed a physical performance improvement (running time and speed) in the stress test of OE group (232.14 ± 102.50) compared to OC (51.67 ± 44.74). The enzyme citrate synthase was lower in OC compared to YC ( P= 0.0020), indicating a deleterious effect of aging,. EE has removed this difference, leaving the OE group similar to YE (P= 0.1529). Regarding the oxidative stress profile, there was a reduction of pro-oxidants in the heart (H202, carbonyls, lipoperoxidation) and in the soleus muscle (carbonyls and lipoperoxidation) of YE group. In the OE there was a significant increase of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) and we observed a increase trend in glutathione peroxidase (GPx). EE was capable of altering body composition (brown and periepydidimal fat), improved physical performance and increased SOD in old mice group. In young group, oxidative damage reduced both in soleus muscle as in the heart, but does not caused significant adjustments in the enzymatic antioxidant defense system

AB  - O enriquecimento ambiental (EA) consiste de uma condição ambiental caracterizada por contato social, novidade e complexidade no ambiente e exercício voluntário. O fortalecimento da conectividade sináptica e neuronal trazido pelo enriquecimento ajuda na explicação de como o EA pode tornar o encéfalo mais resiliente diante da exposição a situações aversivas no futuro, como por exemplo a fatores estressores severos, por meio de aumentos na expressão de BDNF. Diante disso este trabalho avaliou os efeitos do EA sobre a regulação epigenética do Bdnf, o comportamento tipo ansioso, a resposta bioquímica e consumo voluntário de etanol em animais C57/BL expostos ao ambiente enriquecido e ao estresse crônico imprevisível (EI). O ambiente enriquecido per se foi capaz de alterar a expressão gênica de éxons relacionados a expressão do BDNF. Quando o efeito do EA foi testado frente ao EI, os animais enriquecidos exibiram comportamento do tipo ansioso e maior concentração de corticosterona com relação aos não enriquecidos (NE). Ainda, o EI foi capaz de aumentar as concentrações de corticosterona, independente da habitação. Com relação ao consumo de etanol, animais EA expostos ao EI apresentaram maior consumo de etanol durante o estresse e após períodos de privação, revelando uma relação entre a privação e a busca pela droga e um efeito potencializador do EA sobre o consumo de etanol quando associado ao EI. Os achados deste trabalho abrem uma interpretação diferente do padrão comum na literatura com relação aos efeitos do EA frente ao consumo de drogas somente como um fator protetor. Portanto, o tipo e a intensidade do protocolo de estresse num contexto de consumo de etanol constitui um fator determinante sobre a interação do EA com o comportamento e o consumo da droga. ; Environmental enrichment (EE) is an environmental condition characterized by social contact, novelty and complexity in the environment and voluntary exercise. The strengthening of synaptic and neuronal connectivity elicited by EE helps to explain how it can ...

AB  - O estresse é uma resposta adaptativa com componentes neuroendócrinos e comportamentais para manter a homeostase. Sob intenso estresse, pode haver uma ruptura destes mecanismos adaptativos, causando danos na integridade fisiológica e psicológica. O enriquecimento ambiental ameniza os efeitos do estrese. O sagui (Callithrix penicillata) é resistente aos glicocorticóides e possui uma série de estratégias defensivas, favorecendo o desenvolvimento de um modelo potencialmente muito interessante para o estudo do estresse. Neste trabalho, se objetivou estudar em saguis, a resposta comportamental, fisiológica e farmacológica ao estresse e às condições enriquecidas do ambiente. Vinte e quatro animais foram observados em uma linha de base durante 9 semanas. Quatorze padrões comportamentais foram analisados, com o método de animal focal e registro contínuo. Seguiram-se 21 dias para sujeitos submetidos ao estresse (N=10), ao enriquecimento (N=7) e sem manipulação (controle, N=7). No estresse os sujeitos foram isolados e expostos diariamente a breves estressores psicológicos. No enriquecimento os sujeitos receberam inovações e tarefas de obtenção de alimentos no viveiro. Após os tratamentos, seguiu-se uma habituação ao labirinto em \"8\" e exposição ao predador taxidermizado. Após, os sujeitos receberam três doses de buspirona e salina, para avaliar a resposta do sistema serotonérgico, no paradigma do labirinto em \"8\". Foram coletados dados sobre peso, sangue para hemograma, plasmapara dosagem de cortisol, ácidos graxos livres e glicemia. Medidas de temperatura timpânica e retal, também foram coletadas. Os resultados sugerem que o estresse causou uma ruptura dos padrões comportamentais supostamente adaptativos, aumentando o tempo de retraimento na caixa ninho. Houve o aumento na corticosolemia e ácidos graxos livres; ocorreu hipoglicemia e severa perda de peso.

Results demonstrated that CEE differentially protected against attenuation of spontaneous locomotor activity and improved motivated exploratory behaviour, of enriched rats challenged with the D₁ receptor antagonist SCH23390, but did not prevent attenuation of sucrose consumption induced by the D₂ receptor antagonist pimozide. Study 2 (Chapter 3) explored whether memory or affective disturbances could be produced in an early-stage PD rat model, using 6-OHDA to induce dopaminergic cell loss within the substantia nigra of the brain in aged rats. Neither memory nor anhedonic disturbances were evident in the early-stage PD rats. Subsequently, a CEE intervention was not introduced to these animals. Methodological alterations are discussed to improve both cognitive and affective testing of early-stage PD rats.

AB  - O enriquecimento ambiental (EA) é um paradigma experimental complexo que fornece estímulos como exercício, novidade, atividade exploratória e contato social. Por promover neurogênese, o EA tem sido apontado como protetor mediante situações de injúrias, como no estresse, uma vez que estímulos estressores podem deflagrar processos neurodegenerativos e acarretar danos neuronais. Devido ao impacto decorrente do estresse em transtornos como ansiedade, o envolvimento de fatores neurotróficos como o BDNF tem sido amplamente estudado. Além da regulação dependente de estímulos, a transcrição de BDNF também parece sofrer regulação epigenética. Diante disto, o presente trabalho avaliou os efeitos do EA sobre o comportamento tipo-ansioso, parâmetros bioquímicos e expressão gênica de Bdnf no córtex pré-frontal (CPF) de camundongos Swiss machos expostos ao estresse crônico imprevisível (ECI), levando em conta o envolvimento de modificações epigenéticas. O grupo exposto ao EA e submetido ao ECI (EA-ECI) exibiu comportamento tipo-ansioso no labirinto em cruz elevado. Esse comportamento foi revertido após o pré-tratamento com um inibidor de metilação do DNA (5-azacitidina). Na análise da corticosterona, apenas o grupo enriquecido não estressado (EA-NS) apresentou aumento nas concentrações plasmáticas. Embora o EA per se tenha promovido maior expressão do RNAm do éxon IX, considerado o éxon codificante do gene, o grupo EA-ECI apresentou redução na expressão gênica dos éxons I, II, IV, VI e IX do Bdnf no CPF. Em relação à epigenética, as três sequências analisadas para metilação do DNA de Bdnf no respectivo éxon não mostraram diferenças significativas na porcentagem de metilação do DNA nas ilhas CpG investigadas. Em suma, o presente estudo mostrou evidências de que o EA concomitante ao ECI desencadeia comportamento tipo-ansioso, o qual é revertido por um pré-tratamento com inibidor de metilação do DNA. Isso é acompanhado por uma redução marcante da expressão de Bdnf no CPF, sem afetar a metilação do DNA do éxon IX do gene. Juntos, ...

AB  - O enriquecimento ambiental (EA) reverte a sensibilização comportamental (SC) ao etanol em camundongos e diminui os níveis de BDNF no córtex pré-frontal (CPF). O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar os efeitos do EA sobre parâmetros comportamentais, resposta de corticosterona ao estresse, expressão de microRNAS e a participação da via BDNF-TrkB no CPF frente à SC ao etanol. Camundongos mantidos em EA foram submetidos a testes comportamentais (ansiedade, depressão, anedonia e comportamentos repetitivos). Também foram tratados repetidamente com etanol e expostos ao EA para a avaliação da corticosterona plasmática e da expressão de microRNAs no CPF. A via BDNF-TrkB foi inibida no CPF de camundongos que desenvolveram a SC ao etanol. O EA diminuiu a atividade locomotora e exploratória, a ativação do eixo HPA após estresse agudo, aumentou o peso do baço e diminuiu a expressão de miR-132 e let-7d. Os resultados sugerem o envolvimento de microRNAs na reversão da SC ao etanol; contudo, a via BDNF-TrkB no CPF não parece estar diretamente envolvida neste processo. ; The environmental enrichment (EE) reverts the ethanol-induced behavioral sensitization (EIBS) in mice and decreases BDNF levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of EE on behavioral parameters, on the corticosterone response to stress and on microRNA expression and to assess the involvement of the BDNF-TrkB pathway in the PFC on the EIBS. Mice kept in EE were submitted to behavioral tests (anxiety, depression, anhedonia and repetitive behaviors). Mice were also treated repeatedly with ethanol and exposed to EE for the assessment of plasma corticosterone levels and microRNA expression in the PFC. The BDNF-TrkB pathway was blocked in the PFC of mice that developed EIBS. EE decreased locomotion, exploratory activity and HPA axis activation after acute stress, increased spleen weight and decreased miR-132 and let-7d expression. The results suggest the involvement of microRNAs in the reversal of EIBS promoted by EE; however, the BDNF-TrkB pathway in the PFC does not seem to be directly involved in this process.

AB  - 憂鬱症為現今社會普遍發生且嚴重的一種心理精神疾病，儘管憂鬱症的課題已經被相當程度的重視，並且也有?多相關的研究探討，然而截至目前為止，對於憂鬱症的治療效果仍普遍不理想。例如藥物的起始作用慢、藥效作用低且在經歷長期投藥的情況下常引起體內藥物毒性的產生與累積。因此，研究出一個更有效的治療策略來加速藥效產生並延長藥效的持續作用是現今相當重要的課題。在此實驗中，我們擬建立出更快速且有效的憂鬱症治療的策略及方法。在建立動物的憂鬱模式中，我們利用了小鼠坐骨神經損傷模型所引起的慢性疼痛進而產生類憂鬱的行為表現，並以體重下降、絕望行為以及令動物體愉悅的事物偏好程度下降來作為分析的指標，來檢測合併治療方法的可行性。在以腹腔注射的方式投予三環抗鬱藥imipramine及同時將其飼養於豐富優渥的環境之下，觀察使用此等方法是否能更有效的改善小鼠的類憂鬱行為。在尾巴懸吊試驗及糖水偏好試驗的研究中我們發現合併使用imipramine及豐富優渥環境飼養的條件下，可以較快速及持久地改善其類憂鬱之行為。此外，我們也發現坐骨神經損傷之小鼠其腹面海馬迴CA1區域和大腦前額皮質區的錐狀神經細胞元的型態會發生改變，並且在合併使用imipramine及豐富優渥環境的處理，雖然無法完全修正神經元的型態，但仍具有明顯減緩神經元型態改變的情形。接著再利用即時定量聚合酵素連鎖反應測量海馬迴CA1區域和大腦前額皮質區域腦衍生神經滋長因子、血管內皮生長因子以及白細胞介素-1β之mRNA的表現量時，我們發現合併使用imipramine及豐富優渥環境飼養籠具有快速的增加腦衍生神經滋長因子、血管內皮生長因子之mRNA的作用，但不改變白細胞介素-1β之mRNA的表現。在以VEGF受體二型剔除的基因轉殖小鼠作為研究的模式下，我們則發現VEGF受體第二型剔除的基因轉殖小鼠對於合併使用imipramine及豐富優渥環境飼養籠的處理所產生的抗憂鬱行為表現效果明顯的較野生型小鼠效果差。總結以上實驗結果，我們認為合併使用imipramine及豐富優渥環境飼養籠可以產生較快速並長久的抗憂鬱效果。此等策略可能在未來可以做為治療憂鬱症的一個重要參考。 ; Depression is one of the most common and most serious mental health problems facing people today Despite years of research and efforts to develop effective treatments currently available medications have significant limitations most notably low response rate time lag for treatment response and high toxicity Therefore developing a rapid onset of action and more effective treatment strategies are urgently needed We used a combinational therapy of an enriched environment (EE) and a tricyclic antidepressant imipramine for relieving depressive-like behaviors induced by neuropathic pain in a mouse model of spared nerve injury (SNI) As compared with sham-operated animals SNI mice exhibited mechanical allodynia and displayed an increased depressive-like behavior as revealed by a loss of body weight a decrease in sucrose preference and an increase in immobility time during the tail suspension test SNI mice also exhibited a significant decrease in the number of dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons We also found the morphology of the pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex changed Measured the BDNF、VEGF and IL-1β mRNA in hippocampal CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex SNI mice also exhibited a decreased level in mRNA A subchronic (4 days) combination of an EE and imipramine treatment produced robust and rapid antidepressant-like responses compared with single treatment Mice treated by a subchronic (4 days) combination of an EE and imipramine decreased depressive-like behavior in the behavioral tests These antidepressant effects are accompanied by a reversal of dendritic and synaptic reorganization brought about by SNI The levels of BDNF and VEGF mRNA in hippocampal CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex were also elevated by the combinational treatment We also used heterozygous Flk-1 knockout mice to confirm the specific role of VEGF signaling in the effect of combinational treatment These results support that combinational therapy is more effective in providing antidepressant effects than a single treatment These findings may highlight a novel strategy of combining multiple molecular targets to rescue depressive-like symptoms
