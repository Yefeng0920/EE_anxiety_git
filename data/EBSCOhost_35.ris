AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) can improve the welfare of captive fish. Its objective is to provide new sensorial and motor stimulation in order to help meet their behavioural, physiological, morphological and psychological needs, whilst reducing stress and frequency of abnormal behaviours. In fish farms, rearing environments are usually designed from a human perspective and based on economic requirements, mainly for practical reasons for the farmer, with little consideration for animal welfare. Throughout aquaculture production cycles, many farming operations can be stressful for fish, and EE may not only help them cope with these stressful events but also improve their overall welfare. In recent years, increasing interest on the effects of EE in captive fish has focussed mainly on structural enrichment. However, there are many other enrichment strategies that merit attention (e.g. sensorial, occupational, social and dietary enrichment) and which may be of interest for fish farming. Here, we review in depth the existing literature on EE and its effects on the welfare of a wide range of farmed fish species, discussing the feasibility and potential applications of different EE strategies to promote fish welfare at a commercial scale. We also present a practical framework to address the design, validation and implementation of EE by the aquaculture industry, taking in consideration the technical challenges of providing enrichment for farmed fish.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) has been gradually regarded as a common etiologic mechanism for cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) played an important role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), neuronal circuits formation, cognition and psychiatric disorders. Enriched environment (EE) showed a beneficial effect on cognition and depression via effectively regulating AHN and glial reactivity. This study aimed to assess which strategy was feasible to improve cognition and psychiatric disturbances by comparing the TET1 hippocampal microinjection and EE in CCH models and to investigate the possible mechanisms.<bold>Method: </bold>CCH rats were established via permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO). Rats were stereotaxically injected with the human catalytic domain of TET1 (hTET1) to overexpress the hTET1 in the hippocampus 10 days before 2-VO. 3 days after 2-VO, rats were subjected to standard environment or EE with free access to food and water. Behavioral tests were used to appraise depression and cognition before sacrifice. Epigenetic molecules, adult neurogenesis, synaptic proteins expression, and glial activation were analyzed using immunofluorescent staining, qRT-PCR and western blot.<bold>Results: </bold>In the present study, we found both EE and genetical treatment with overexpressing hTET1 were sufficient for stimulating AHN. However, promoting ANH could not deal with the cognitive dysfunction and depressive-like behaviors in CCH rats. Notably, a healthy local brain environment with elevated BDNF and astrocytes was conducive to improving cognitive dysfunction. Meanwhile, astrocytes were involved in the cognitive regulating process of neurons, presynaptic function and microglia. In general, we held that depressive disturbances were determined by BDNF levels, neuronal and presynaptic function, as well as glial activation containing astrocytes and microglia. To further support this point, we investigated severe depressive symptoms that were strongly correlated with the activation of astroglia and microglia. Importantly, causal mediation analysis showed significant mediation by the presence of reactive glial cells in the relation between neural plasticity and depressive symptoms. Finally, we showed EE performed better than hTET1 treatment for cognitive deficits and depression. EE with less glial reactivity was much more resistant to depression, while hTET1 with more glial activation was more vulnerable to depressive disorders.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>EE was likely to be superior to TET1 hippocampal administration for cognition and psychiatric behaviors in CCH rats. Furthermore, a healthy local brain environment with elevated BDNF and astrocytes was conducive to improving cognitive dysfunction. More glial activation, and more vulnerable to depressive disorders. These results were important for our understanding of disease mechanisms and provided valuable tools for the overall management of CCH patients. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) in rodents is associated with a wide range of physiological, affective, and cognitive benefits. A seemingly opposite housing condition, social isolation (SI), is used as a rodent model of stress, negatively affecting several neurobiological mechanisms and hampering cognitive performance. Experimental designs that involve switching between these housing conditions produced mixed results. We evaluated different behavioral and cognitive effects of brief EE following long-term, SI-induced stress. We revealed the influence of enrichment after 30 days of isolation on behavioral despair, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial working memory in adult male Wistar rats and found a substantial anxiolytic effect in the experimental (SI to EE) group. Interestingly, rats exposed to EE also showed increased behavioral despair compared with the control (continuous SI) group. There was no difference in spatial working memory performance at the end of a 5-day water Y-maze (WYM) test. However, the SI to EE animals displayed better memory performance in the first 2 days of the WYM, indicating faster learning. In line with this difference, we recorded significantly more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos+) cells in the retrosplenial and perirhinal cortices of the SI to EE animals. The lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala showed no such difference. These results suggest that brief enrichment following isolation stress leads to differential results in affective and cognitive systems.

AB  - Sexual conflict is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and often involves costly sexual harassment of females by males. An overlooked outcome of sexual conflict is its potential impact on social behaviour. Due to their seemingly harmful mode of copulation (traumatic insemination) and tendency to form aggregations, bed bugs are an ideal model for studying the social implications of sexual conflict. Repeated traumatic inseminations are known to reduce some aspects of female fitness, so we expected the benefits to males and the high costs for females of frequent mating to result in divergent social preferences between the sexes. To examine the impact of sexual harassment on social structure, we devised a novel experimental arena with either two shelters or 12 shelters and continuously tracked sexual and social interactions between individually marked bed bugs over 6 days. By constructing aggregation networks, we examined whether female bed bugs occupied more peripheral network positions compared to males as well as whether females preferentially associated with other females as a strategy to reap the benefits of group living while mitigating the costs of unsolicited sexual attention. We found no evidence that females shape their social environment to evade associating with males. However, when tested individually in a follow-up experiment, mated females showed a strong preference for social cues from females over social cues from males. Our results therefore suggest that males and females may be in conflict over the composition of social associations and highlight the importance of both examining behaviour at the individual level and tracking larger groups of freely interacting populations in more complex environments. • Sexual conflict may differentially influence social behaviour of females and males. • We constructed bed bug social networks to see whether females socially evade males. • Aggregation networks did not show female avoidance through decreased sociality. • Social networks were also not assorted by sex. • However, females preferred social cues associated with other females over males.

AB  - Enrichment of milking environment through music has been proposed to help animals to cope with divergent stressors. In sight of the above, a study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Indian instrumental music-based environmental enrichment played in yaman raga on milk production performance and behaviour in cattle. A total of 21 lactating dairy cattle (Vrindavani crossbred cows) having similar parity and stage of lactation were selected in three groups — T1, T2 and T3, each consisting of seven animals. The T1 and T2 groups were exposed to instrumental flute and sitar, respectively, 10 min prior to the start of milking and continued till completion of milking; while the T3 group served as control. Musical enrichment of the environment was done using recorded-tape of flute and sitar was played in yamen raga at 40–60 (dB) decibel intensity. The results revealed a non-significant difference in milk yield, rectal temperature, respiration rate, T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine) hormones. However, there exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) difference in milking time, milking speed, cortisol hormones and behavioural parameters such as milk let-down in the animals exposed to music compared to the control group. Thus, the results have significant implications relating to the behavioural fitness and welfare of dairy animals and reducing residual milk. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - Exposure to chronic stress has detrimental effects on cognitive and emotional processing. Also, the neuroprotective influences of environmental enrichment (EE) and royal jelly (RJ) have been indicated in previous studies. To our knowledge, to date, there are no studies about the synergistic effects of EE and RJ on cognitive changes induced by stress. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of RJ, and EE on anxiety-like behaviors, cognitive functions, and expression of hippocampal and also prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in stressed rats. By using restraint and cold temperature, rats were exposed to stressful situations and then subjected to treatment with RJ or/ and EE for 14 days. Stress induction was done 14 days before treatments by placing the rats in the restrainer under 4°C. Following the interventions, anxiety-like behaviors, novel object recognition memory (NORM), inhibitive avoidance performance, hippocampal, and PFC BDNF expression were examined. The plasma corticosterone level of all groups was also evaluated. Results showed increased plasma corticosterone levels, stress-induced deficits in the NORM and IA tests, and increased anxiety-like behaviors. EE and RJ improved these deficits with a decline in serum corticosterone and also increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus and PFC in stressed ones. The EE and the RJ prevented the detrimental effects of stress on anxiety-like behaviors and memory processes. These treatments can protect susceptible brain areas against chronic stress via improvement in behavioral and cognitive impairments through mediating BDNF expression. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - Personality has been identified in a range of animal taxa during the last few decades, with important ecological and evolutionary implications. Investigating the effects of environmental factors during early life can provide important insights into the ontogeny of animal personality. We reared newborn mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis , in tanks of different structural complexities, and measured their behavioral traits (i.e. shyness, exploration, and sociability) when they reached sexual maturity. Univariate linear mixed-effects models were fitted to test the effects of environmental complexity and sex on population-average behavior, whereas multivariate models were fitted to quantify behavioral repeatability (i.e. personality) and among-individual correlations (i.e. behavioral syndromes). On average, females were shyer and more social than males, and the fish reared in complex environments were shyer, less explorative, and more social than those reared in open environments. Among-individual differences were consistently large across trials for all behaviors, indicating that personality variation was present in mosquitofish of both sexes reared in different environments. Repeatability did not differ among behaviors, and there were no differences in repeatability in any behavior between sexes or among environments. A negative correlation between shyness and exploration was found in mosquitofish from all treatments at both phenotypic and among-individual levels, with the latter indicating a strong shyness–exploration behavioral syndrome. Our study provides robust evidence that average levels of personality might vary when mosquitofish are raised in different levels of structural complexity during early life. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction: Interventions performed in the early period of life are associated with cognitive and behavioral changes in adulthood. The effects of interventions such as exposure to an early stressful life event or environmental enrichment on cognitive and behavioral development are studied. The aim of this study is to develop a new intervention method, to investigate the effects of early interventions on social interaction, memory anxiety levels and NR2B levels in prefrontal and hippocampus in adulthood. The hypothesis of the study is that exposure to the ambivalent mother will affect the behavioral performance of rats at least as much as one hour apart from the mother in the adult period and cause changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the NR2B levels. Method: In the study, the Wistar rats were divided into four groups as control group (12), group that remained 15 minutes apart from mother (Mild Stress) (12), group that remained 60 minutes apart from mother (Severe Stress) (14) and ambivalent mother group (13). In adulthood, the social interaction test, elevated plus maze and new object recognition test performances of rats were evaluated. ELISA method was used to evaluate the effect of interventions on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus NMDA R2B levels. Results: The important findings of the study were that in the new object recognition test, separation from the mother did not affect the recognition memory regardless of gender, while the short-term recognition memory of the females of the ambivalent mothers' group was better than the females in the other groups and the long-term memory performance of the mild stress groups men was better than the man in the other groups. In addition, in the social interaction test, the males of the ambivalent group and the mild stress group showed more aggressive behavior. It was determined that the prefrontal cortex NR2B level was higher in the mild stress and ambivalent mother group compared to the severe stress group, and NR2B level was increased in all intervention groups compared to the control group. Conclusion: In contrast to the hypothesis, the results of this study support that the ambivalent mother's group rats are not more adversely affected than the severe group rats and that the model created may be an environmental enrichment model rather than an early stressful life event exposure.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to validate a rapid method to detect and quantify colistin resistance genes (mcr‐1 to mcr‐5) by real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) in diverse matrices. Methods and results: The detection limit of two newly designed SYBR Green real‐time PCR assays for mcr‐4 and mcr‐5 and of previously published protocols for mcr‐1 to mcr‐3 was assessed using serial dilutions of reference strains. The assays could detect all five mcr genes with the lower limit of 102 copy numbers. Escherichia coli isolates (n = 1062) and environmental samples (n = 93) were tested for the presence of mcr genes. The assays enabled the detection of colistin resistance genes both in bacterial isolates and in complex environmental samples. Conclusions: This method represents a set of sensitive, rapid and effective assays for the screening of colistin resistance directly from the environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: Colistin is an antimicrobial commonly used in animals and has recently emerged as a last‐resort treatment in humans. Plasmid‐mediated mcr genes confer resistance to colistin and represent a major threat for public health since they can be easily disseminated through horizontal gene transfer. The rapid and sensitive detection of mcr genes is of utmost necessity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - Rationale: During the last few decades, alcohol use disorders (AUD) have reached an epidemic prevalence, yet social influences on alcoholism have not been fully addressed. Several factors can modulate alcohol intake. On one hand, stress can reinforce ethanol-induced behaviors and be an important component in AUD and alcoholism. On the other hand, environmental enrichment (EE) has a neuroprotective role and prevents the development of excessive ethanol intake in rodents. However, studies showing the role of EE in chronic psychosocial stress-impaired ethanol-conditioned rewards are nonexistent. Aim: The purpose of the current study is to explore the potential protective role of EE on extinction and reinstatement of ethanol-conditioned place preference (EtOH-CPP) following chronic psychosocial stress. Methods: In the first experiment and after the EtOH-CPP test, the mice were subjected to 15 days of chronic stress, then housed in a standard (SE) or enriched environment (EE) while EtOH-CPP extinction was achieved by repeated exposure to the CPP chambers without ethanol injection. In the second experiment and after the EtOH-CPP test, extinction was achieved as described above. Mice were then exposed to chronic stress for 2 weeks before being housed in a SE or EE. EtOH-CPP reinstatement was induced by a single exposure to the conditioning chambers. Results: As expected, stress exposure increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced weight gain. More importantly, we found that EE significantly shortened chronic stress-delayed extinction and decreased the reinstatement of EtOH-CPP. Conclusion: These results support the hypothesis that EE reduces the impact of alcohol-associated environmental stimuli, and hence it may be a general intervention for reducing cue-elicited craving and relapse in humans.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is an important risk factor for depression and cognitive deficits in humans. Enriched environment (EE) showed a beneficial effect on depression and cognition by enhancing brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and synaptic plasticity. However, it is still not clearly understood whether an epigenetic mechanism is involved in the BDNF modulation and synaptic plasticity that occurs after EE treatment for the depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits elicited by CUMS. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of EE.<bold>Methods: </bold>All rats were exposed to the 5-week CUMS procedure except the control group. After CUMS procedure, some rats were stereotaxically injected with SIRT1 pharmacologic inhibitor EX527 or SIRT1 knocking down lentivirus (sh-SIRT1) in the hippocampus followed by EE treatment for 3 weeks. Other rats were directly subjected to EE treatment without stereotaxic injection. Behavioral tests were used to appraise depression and cognition after EE treatment. Then epigenetic molecules, synaptic proteins, dendritic spine density and branches, and synaptic morphology of the dorsal hippocampus were determined.<bold>Results: </bold>We found that CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors including decreased sucrose preference ratio, prolonged immobility and reduced locomotor and exploratory activity; cognitive deficits including spatial learning and memory impairment; reduced dendritic spine density and number of branches; thinned postsynaptic density; downregulated SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway, decreased BDNF and synaptic proteins including synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expression in the hippocampus. However, the CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors, cognitive deficits, dendritic spine density and branch number reduction, postsynaptic density thinning, SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway downregulation, BDNF and synaptic proteins reduction, including synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), were reversed by EE treatment. However, depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits were observed again in rats subjected to stereotaxic injection with EX527 or sh-SIRT1. Furthermore, this study also found that SIRT1/microRNA-134 regulates the downstream molecules BDNF, and the synaptic proteins SYN and PSD95 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>This study provides evidence for the neuroprotective role of EE on depression and cognitive deficits by activating the SIRT1/microRNA-134 pathway, which accounts for the regulation of synaptic proteins, including BDNF, PSD95 and SYN, dendritic remodeling and ultrastructure changes of synapses in the hippocampus.

AB  - The identification and characterization of variables that influence "liking" and enhance vulnerability to repeated alcohol use are vital to understanding and treating alcohol use disorders. In the current study, we explore the influence of rearing environment and experimenter-administered adolescent ethanol on the hedonic value of ethanol, sucrose, and quinine. Male and female rats were reared for 30 days starting at postnatal day (PND) 21 in either an enriched, isolated, or standard condition and received 1.5 g/kg (intraperitoneally [i.p.]) 20% (w/v) ethanol or saline every other day for 12 days starting at PND 28. Thereafter, all rats had indwelling intraoral fistulae implanted and their taste reactivities to water, ethanol (5, 10, 20, 30, 40% v/v), sucrose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 M), and quinine (0.1, 0.5 mM) were recorded and analyzed. Results indicated that enrichment elevated hedonic responding to sucrose compared to isolation, and induced a stronger negative relationship between hedonic responding and ethanol concentration compared to standard conditions. Enrichment also elevated aversive responding to ethanol and quinine compared to both isolated and standard condition rats. Adolescent ethanol injections marginally reduced aversive responding to quinine. These results replicate previous findings that environmental enrichment enhances both "liking" and aversion. In addition, the current findings suggest that, while adolescent ethanol injections may blunt aversive responses to quinine, they have no effect on aversive or hedonic responding to ethanol or sucrose. Together with existing literature, our results may suggest that experience with the taste of ethanol is necessary for alterations to ethanol "liking" and aversion.

AB  - Objectives: This study examined the beneficial effects of cerebrolysin (CBL) and enriched environment (EE), alone or in combination, on the neurobehavioral and molecular changes in the post-ischemic depression (PID) model in mice.Materials and Methods: PID was induced in male Balb/c mice (25-30 g) by combining the transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (bCCAO), twice for 5 min at the interval of 10 min, with spatial restraint stress (2 h/day) for 2 weeks, started 48 h following the establishment of bCCAO model. Animals in the treatment groups received CBL (2.5 ml/kg) and/or were housed in EE (2 h/day) for two weeks. Anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and sociability were evaluated the day after the last experiment. Changes in the serum corticosterone level, the hippocampal oxidative stress status, inflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB)/CREB ratio were also detected.Results: PID model induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and impaired social behavior. These behavioral changes were accompanied by increased serum corticosterone level, increased lipid peroxidation, decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced BDNF levels and p-CREB/CREB ratio, and increased protein levels of NF-κB and Iba-1 in the hippocampus. However, treatment with CBL and/or EE reversed behavioral and molecular changes induced by PID.Conclusion: Our findings imply that the model mimics many manifestations of human PID, and CBL and EE treatments, separately or in combination, are beneficial in reducing anxiety- and- depressive-like behaviors in this model.

AB  - Objective: Stress is linked to negative cardiovascular consequences and increases in depressive behaviors. Environmental enrichment (EE) involves exposure to novel items that provide physical and cognitive stimulation. EE has behavioral, cognitive, and neurobiological effects that may improve stress responses in humans and animal models. This study investigated the potential protective effects of EE on behavior and cardiovascular function in female prairie voles after a social stressor.Methods: Radiotelemetry transmitters were implanted into female prairie voles to measure heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) throughout the study. All females were paired with a male partner for 5 days, followed by separation from their partner for 5 additional days, and a 10-day treatment period. Treatment consisted of continued isolation, isolation with EE, or re-pairing with the partner (n = 9 per group). After treatment, animals were observed in the forced swim test (FST) for measures of stress coping behaviors.Results: Isolation elevated HR and reduced HRV relative to baseline for all groups (p < .001). HR and HRV returned to baseline in the EE and re-paired groups, but not in the continued isolation group (p < .001). Animals in the EE and re-paired groups displayed significantly lower immobility time (p < .001) and HR (p < .03) during the FST, with a shorter latency for HR to return to baseline levels after the FST, relative to the continued isolation group (p < .001).Conclusions: EE and re-pairing reversed the negative behavioral and cardiovascular consequences associated with social isolation.

N2  - Rationale: Early-life environment influences reinforcer and drug motivation in adulthood; however, the impact on specific components of motivation, including hedonic value ("liking"), remains unknown. Objectives: The current study determined whether differential rearing alters liking and aversive responding to ethanol, sucrose, and quinine in an ethanol-naïve rat model. Methods: Male and female rats were reared for 30 days starting at postnatal day 21 in either an enriched (EC), isolated (IC), or standard condition (SC). Thereafter, all rats had indwelling intraoral fistulae implanted and their taste reactivity to water, ethanol (5, 10, 20, 30, 40% v/v), sucrose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 M), and quinine (0.1, 0.5 mM) was recorded and analyzed. Results: EC rats had higher amounts of liking responses to ethanol, sucrose, and quinine and higher amounts of aversive responses to ethanol and quinine compared to IC rats. While EC and IC rats' responses were different from each other, they both tended to be similar to SCs, who fell in between the EC and IC groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that environmental enrichment may enhance sensitivity to a variety of tastants, thereby enhancing liking, while isolation may dull sensitivity, thereby dulling liking. Altogether, the evidence suggests that isolated rats have a shift in the allostatic set-point which may, in part, drive increased responding for a variety of rewards including ethanol and sucrose. Enriched rats have enhanced liking of both sucrose and ethanol suggesting that enrichment may offer a unique phenotype with divergent preferences for incentive motivation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - The existence of play, a form of behaviour without obvious benefits to survival or reproduction, is a long-standing ethological mystery. Experiments in which socially deprived juvenile male mammals develop into sexually incompetent adults, along with widespread sexual dimorphism in rough-and-tumble play (R&T), suggest that R&T may prepare juvenile males for adult sexual behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal study of American mink, Neovison vison , on two farms, with two cohorts each. For males ( N = 121), we predicted that individuals with the highest frequencies of rough-and-tumble play as juveniles (10–20 weeks old) would, as adults, show shorter latencies to bite females' necks and to begin copulating, and copulate for longer durations. On one farm, we conducted a pilot study of females ( N = 10) as a preliminary test of the hypothesis that R&T also prepares females for adult sexual behaviour. Here, our predictions were the opposite of those for males, since abilities to limit the number or duration of copulations could allow females to exercise pre- or postcopulatory mate choice. In total, we observed 1669 male–female encounters and 1004 separate copulations. As predicted, frequent juvenile R&T predicted long-lasting copulations in adult males and longer latencies to copulate in adult females. This was true specifically of rough-and-tumble play itself, independently of general activity levels and, among a subset of 32 males reared in environmentally enriched housing, also independently of solitary object play. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that juvenile rough-and-tumble play predicts adult sexual behaviour in any species. Further research is required to test whether our results for females can be replicated, and, importantly, to determine whether play truly has a causal role in either of these correlational relationships.

AB  - Depression is caused by a variety of factors, especially stressful life events. Chronic stress–induced depression has detrimental effects on hippocampal integrity. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a beneficial intervention for improving anxiety, fear, and stress. We aimed to investigate the antidepressive effects of EE in a depressive rat model (DEP) that was subjected to chronic stress. The control group (n = 10) was kept under normal conditions, while depressive rats (n = 8 per group) were randomized into DEP, DEP + EE, and DEP + fluoxetine (Flx) groups. DEP + EE/Flx groups were exposed to standard housing and EE or Flx, respectively. The behavioral tests showed that hopelessness and anxiety were decreased in DEP + EE and DEP + Flx groups compared with the DEP group (p < .05). Similarly, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and tryptophan hydroxylase was significantly higher in the DEP + EE and DEP + Flx (p < .05) groups. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine receptor kinase B were also significantly higher in the DEP + EE and DEP + Flx groups compared with the DEP group (p < .05). Our findings can serve as a foundation for future investigations examining the effects of environmental improvement and physical exercise in patients with depression. This study suggests that EE may be useful for mitigating the detrimental effects of chronic stress in patients with depression.

AB  - Objectives: Social isolation is associated with depression, anxiety, and negative health outcomes. Environmental enrichment, including environmental and cognitive stimulation with inanimate objects and opportunities for physical exercise, may be an effective strategy to include in treatment paradigms for affective disorders as a function of social isolation. In a rodent model-the socially monogamous prairie vole-we investigated the hypothesis that depression- and anxiety-related behaviors after social isolation would be prevented and remediated with environmental enrichment.Methods: Experiment 1 investigated the preventive effects of environmental enrichment on negative affective behaviors when administered concurrently with social isolation. Experiment 2 investigated the remediating effects of enrichment on negative affective behaviors when administered after a period of isolation. Behaviors were measured in three operational tests: open field, forced swim test (FST), and elevated plus maze.Results: In isolated prairie voles, enrichment prevented depression-relevant (immobility in FST, group × housing interaction, p = .049) and anxiety-relevant behaviors (exploration in open field, group × housing interaction, p = .036; exploration in elevated plus maze, group × housing interaction, p = .049). Delayed enrichment also remediated these behaviors in isolated animals (immobility in FST, main effect of housing, p = .001; exploration in open field, main effect of housing, p = .047; exploration in elevated plus maze, main effect of housing, p = .001) and was slightly more effective than physical exercise alone in remediating anxiety-relevant behaviors.Conclusions: These findings provide insight into the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on depression- and anxiety-relevant behaviors using a translational rodent model of social isolation.

AB  - In recent years, an increasing number of farmers are choosing to keep their cows indoors throughout the year. Indoor housing of cows allows farmers to provide high-yielding individuals with a nutritionally balanced diet fit for their needs, and it has important welfare benefits for both cows and their calves, such as protection from predators, parasites, and exposure to extreme weather conditions. However, it also confronts cows and calves with a wide range of environmental challenges. These include abiotic environmental sources of stress (e.g., exposure to loud and aversive sound) and confinement- specific stressors (e.g., restricted movement and maintenance in abnormal social groups). Cows and calves that live indoors are alsofaced with the challenge of occupying long periods with a limited range of possible behavioral patterns. Environmental enrichment can improve biological functioning (measured as increased lifetime reproductive success, increased inclusive fitness, or a correlate of these such as improved health), help animals to cope with stressors in their surroundings, reduce frustration, increase the fulfillment of behavioral needs, and promote more positive affective states. Here, we review recent findings on the effect of social, occupational, physical, sensory, and nutritional enrichment on dairy cows and calves, and we assess the appropriateness and practicality of implementing different enrichment practices on commercial dairy farms. Some of the enrichment methods reviewed here may also be applied to those more extensive cattle-raising systems, where similar challenges occur. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Primary objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of mild-to- moderate (m-mod) traumatic brain injury (TBI) on spontaneous object (SO) recognition and temporal order (TO) memory in male Wistar rats and to compare the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) and simvastatin (Sim) on SO and TO memory post-injury. Research design: A randomized repeated measure experimental design was used. Methods and procedure: Seven days after arrival, animals received the injury or sham surgery. Using a Y-shaped maze, SO and TO memory was assessed in the two groups of animals at 6, 24, 48, 72 hours and 7, 14, 21 and 35 days post-surgery. Total time exploring each object and discrimination ratio were calculated and analysed. Then SO and TO memory were compared between two groups that received either Sim or EE for 2 hours daily starting 24 hours post-injury and a sham group that received saline for 14 days post-injury. Results: The results showed that the injury impaired SO and TO memory compared to the sham up to 35 days post-trauma. Injured animals exhibited familiarity preference, novelty aversion and impaired TO performance. EE improved the animals' SO recognition deficits 7 days post-injury after a shorter delay (1 minute) only and Sim reversed TO memory deficits 14 days post-injury after a longer delay (60 minutes). Conclusion: Persistent SO and TO memory deficits follow TBI in animals; Simv and EE seem to be promising therapies of TBI memory deficits. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Childhood trauma is associated with the development of adult mental health and substance use disorders, with females generally being more at risk. Alcohol is commonly used for coping with trauma, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ∼14.4 million adult Americans annually. Research investigating sex differences in the environmental modification of anxiety and alcohol use following childhood trauma will extend our understanding of the etiology of AUD. Here, we sought to model the interacting effects of a single-episode late childhood trauma with post-trauma environment on adult alcohol use using male and female mice.Methods: C57Bl6/J mice (d22) exposed to predator odor (TMT) or water were reared in standard environments (SE) or environmental enrichment (EE). Mice were assessed for adolescent anxiety and conditioned fear, and for adult alcohol use in a limited access, response non-contingent, alcohol exposure paradigm.Results: A single exposure to predator odor was an effective stressor, inducing long-term sex-dependent changes in conditioned fear and alcohol behaviors that interacted with post-trauma environment. Adolescent EE females showed more conditioned freezing to the trauma-associated context. Adult EE mice consumed less total alcohol than SE mice. However, alcohol use across time differed for males and females. Exposure to a childhood stressor increased alcohol use significantly in females, but not males. EE males, but not EE females, drank less than SE counterparts.Conclusions: Findings from this model recapitulate greater vulnerability to childhood trauma in females and support sex differences in post-trauma development of conditioned fear and alcohol use that are modified by environment.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia. It occurs when the cerebral blood supply is reduced by disarrangement of the circulatory system. Environmental enrichment (EE) has been associated with cognitive improvement, motor function recovery, and anxiety relief with respect to various neurodegenerative diseases and emotional stress models. The purpose of this study was to determine whether long-term EE influenced cognitive impairment in a rat model of chronic hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAo). The Y-maze and Morris water maze tests were performed to evaluate the rats' cognitive functions. Also, the protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated cAMP-calcium response element binding protein (pCREB), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were confirmed by Western blot. The microvessels and angiogenesis-associated proteins in the hippocampal region were investigated using immunohistochemistry. The VaD + EE group showed significantly better cognitive functions than the VaD group in both the Y-maze and MWM tests. In addition, the VaD + EE group showed significantly increased expression of BDNF, pCREB, and VEGF in the hippocampus compared to the VaD group. Rats in the VaD + EE group also had increased length of microvessels and VEGF expression in the hippocampus. These results suggest that long-term EE exerts neuroprotective effects against cognitive impairment induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion through the enhancement of BDNF, pCREB, and VEGF expression and indicate that EE may be a good nursing intervention in vascular dementia patients.

AB  - For captive animals, living in barren conditions leads to stereotypic behaviour that is hard to alleviate using environmental enrichment. This resistance to enrichment is often explained via mechanisms that decouple abnormal behaviour from current welfare, such as ‘establishment’: a hypothetical process whereby repetition increases behaviour’s predictability and resistance to change. If such hypotheses are correct, then animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should still find enrichments rewarding. Alternatively, this behaviour could reflect a failure to improve welfare: plausible because age and chronic stress increase neophobia and anhedonia. If this hypothesis is correct, animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should value enrichments less than conspecifics. We tested these hypotheses using C57BL/6 mice, Mus musculus, aged 10–11 and 6–7 months, raised in barren laboratory cages. We observed their behaviour in both these and large enriched cages. Enrichment was more effective on the younger animals. However, contrary to ideas about establishment, the spontaneous predictability of stereotypic behaviour did not increase with age; nor was enrichment less effective on more predictable or time-consuming forms. We assessed the reward value of enriched cages by allowing access via progressively weighted doors (maximum weight pushed corresponding to peak motivation). In older mice, those individuals whose stereotypic behaviour was least reduced by enrichment were also the least motivated to gain access to enrichment. This suggests that the welfare of middle-aged-animals, as well as their stereotypic behaviour, is harder to improve using environmental enrichment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Previous research has shown that rats reared in an enriched condition (EC) are more sensitive to the acute effects of amphetamine than rats reared in an isolated condition (IC); yet, EC rats self-administer less amphetamine than IC rats. The present study used cocaine to further explore this environmental enrichment behavioral phenotype, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. Methods: Enriched condition and IC rats were studied in a broad battery of behavioral tests, including cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration and several measures of anxiety- and depression-related behavior. The involvement of the transcription factor, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), in mediating EC versus IC differences was investigated. Results: Enriched condition rats exhibited less cocaine self-administration, despite showing enhanced cocaine CPP. Enriched condition rats also displayed less depression-like behavior but higher levels of anxiety-like behavior. This behavioral phenotype is consistent with low CREB activity in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region. Indeed, EC rats have less phospho-CREB (the transcriptionally active form of the protein) in the nucleus accumbens than IC rats, and a selective knockdown of CREB in this brain region of normally reared rats, by use of a novel viral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against CREB, reproduced the EC behavioral phenotype. Conclusions: These studies identify a potential molecular mechanism for how rearing environment—a nonpharmacological, nonsurgical manipulation—can modify a wide range of complex emotional behaviors.

AB  - Experimental and clinical studies suggest that prenatal experiences may influence health trajectories up to adulthood and high age. According to the hypothesis of developmental origins of health and disease exposure of pregnant women to stress, nutritional challenges, infection, violence, or war may "program" risks for diseases in later life. Stress and anxieties can exist or be provoked in parents after fertility treatment, after information or diagnosis of fetal abnormalities and demand simultaneous caring concepts to support the parents. In vulnerable groups, it is therefore important to increase the stress resilience to avoid harmful consequences for the growing child. "Enriched environment" defines a key paradigm to decipher how interactions between genes and environment change the structure and function of the brain. The regulation of the fetal hippocampal neurogenesis and morphology during pregnancy is one example of this complex interaction. Animal experiments have demonstrated that an enriched environment can revert consequences of stress in the offspring during critical periods of brain plasticity. Epigenetic markers of stress or wellbeing during pregnancy might even be diagnosed by fragments of placental DNA in the maternal circulation that show characteristic methylation patterns. The development of fetal senses further illustrates how external stimulation may impact individual preferences. Here, we therefore not only discuss how maternal stress influences cognitive development and resilience, but also design possibilities of non-invasive interventions for both mothers and children summarized and evaluated in the light of their potential to improve the health of future generations.

AB  - Rats, Rattus norvegicus, housed with ‘environmental enrichment’ do better in tests of spatial cognition than rats housed in barren cages. The leading hypothesis is that exposure to ‘social and inanimate complexity’ leads to better cognitive-processing abilities, which directly enhances performance in a spatial task. However, enrichment is associated with reduced stress responses and anxiety in novel or acutely stressful situations (cognitive tasks are typically both). Therefore, a plausible alternative hypothesis is that experience of enrichment indirectly enhances performance by reducing a rat''s anxiety levels during cognitive testing. We found that, irrespective of sex, enriched rats outperformed barren-housed rats in the Morris water maze. However, after accounting for the effects of thigmotaxis (a behavioural anxiety measure during testing), there was no significant difference in performance between enriched and barren-housed rats. Enriched rats were simply less thigmotactic and this indirectly improved their performance. This was true for both males and females. We conclude that enrichment reduces anxiety outside the home cage, in a cognitive test situation, and, subsequently, the cognitive benefits of enrichment occur because enriched animals are less anxious during cognitive testing.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural circuit plasticity that results in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life. Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic plasticity during their maturation and can account for up to ten per cent of the entire granule cell population. Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial effects on cognition and mood, such as learning, environmental enrichment, exercise and chronic treatment with antidepressants. Together, these properties of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific cognitive functions, as well as some of the behavioural effects of antidepressants, it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal ageing.

AB  - Recent evidence now suggests the involvement of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) system in mood disorders. Specifically, several members of the FGF family have been shown to be dysregulated in individuals with major depression. In this review, we will introduce the FGF system in terms of structure and function during development, in adulthood, and in various regions and cell types. We will also review the FGF system as a mediator of neural plasticity. Furthermore, this review will summarize animal as well as human studies. The majority of animal studies have focused on stress, environmental enrichment, pharmacological manipulations, and the hippocampus. By contrast, human studies have focused on volumetric measurements, antidepressant literature, and, most recently, post-mortem microarray experiments. In summary, a reduced tone in the FGF system might alter brain development or remodeling and result in a predisposition or vulnerability to mood disorders, including major depression.

AB  - Background Our prior work on the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) developmental model of schizophrenia showed that MAM-treated offspring during prepuberty have increased anxiety, hyper-responsivity to stress, and hyperactivity in the amygdala, prior to dopamine dysregulation. Furthermore, treating anxiety prepubertally prevented the emergence of hyperdopaminergic state in adulthood. These data suggest that early developmental disruption (genetic or environmental) might render individuals more susceptible to stress during critical time windows, during which unregulated stress can lead to the emergence of psychosis later in life. If this is true, one can further hypothesize that 1) sufficiently intense stress during vulnerable periods can lead to a similar hyperdopaminergic state in normal rats, and 2) reducing stress prepubertally can potentially prevent the manifestation of hyperdopaminergia in MAM rats. Methods Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered MAM at gestational day 17 and the offspring were tested as adults. In a subset of these rats, environmental enrichment (EE) was performed during postnatal day (PD) 21–40. In normal rats, stressors were administered in juvenility (PD21-30), adolescence (PD31-40), or adulthood (PD65-74). The stress paradigm consisted of 10-day footshock, 3 sessions of restraint stress, or a combination of both. A separate cohort of normal rats were treated with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, sodium valproate (VPA, 300mg/kg; i.p.) or SAHA (25mg/kg; i.p.), beginning 5 days before the stress paradigm and continuing until the end of the stress. Immunohistochemical analyses of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) were conducted, and dopamine neuron activity was recorded in vivo in the VTA. Results Adult MAM rats exhibited increased DA neuron population activity in the VTA, manifested hyper-locomotion to amphetamine and disruption in novel object recognition. In contrast, early EE prevented this occurrence. Furthermore, combined stress during juvenility or adolescence in normal rats lead to changes similar to that observed in MAM rats, as well as altered maturation of PV interneurons in the ventral hippocampus. Of note, juvenile rats exhibited increased vulnerability to stress comparing to adolescent rats, as footshock alone induced MAM-like changes in adulthood only in this group. In contrast, stress during adulthood only led to a short-term hypodopaminergic state that is more consistent with a depression phenotype. However, in adult rats pre-treated with HDAC inhibitors which putatively reopen the developmental critical period, combined stress now led to a persistent loss of PV-PNN labeling in the ventral hippocampus, resulting in a hyperdopaminergic state in the VTA. Discussion These data demonstrate the timing of stress as a critical factor determining the pathophysiological consequences. The fact that MAM can be circumvented via alleviation of stress prepubertally and that prepubertal stress can lead to a similar pathophysiology suggests that the predisposition to schizophrenia may be based on increased impact of stress prepubertally, when the PV neurons are in a vulnerable state. In contrast, in adults the PV neurons are protected by the PNNs, such that the same stressors now lead to a depressive state. However, reopening the critical period via histone deacetylase inhibition now causes adult rats to be susceptible to stress-induced schizophrenia-like hyperdopaminergic phenotype. This suggests that depression and schizophrenia may share a common predisposition in terms of increased stress susceptibility at different developmental stages, with the exact pathophysiology dependent on the timing of stress exposure.

AB  - Background The combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are believed to underlie susceptibility to schizophrenia. Stress is known to activate the basolateral amygdala and, via its projections to the hippocampus, induce parvalbumin (PV) interneuron loss. This in turn leads to dopamine system overdrive thought to underlie psychosis. We have shown in the MAM developmental disruption model that increased anxiety prepubertally can drive this circuit to lead to interneuron loss, and moreover combined stressors in normal rats prepubertally can mimic this effect, which is exacerbated when prelimbic prefrontal cortical control of the amygdala is disrupted. We now show that the timing of the insult is critical, that reopening the critical period in the adult can lead to a similar condition, and finally relieving stress prepubertally via environmental enrichment can circumvent the later transition to the hyperdopaminergic state. Methods Pregnant rats were administered methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) at gestational day 17 and the offspring tested as adults. In a subset of these rats, exposure to environmental enrichment was performed at postnatal day (PD) 21–40. Normal rats were also exposed to 10 days footshock and 3 sessions of restraint stress either during PD 31–40 or 65–75 and tested 1–2 weeks or 5–6 weeks after the stressor. In a subset of adult stress rats, rats were exposed to the histone deacetylase inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) or SAHA beginning 5 days before the stress and continuing through the stress protocol. Immunohistochemical detection of PV neurons and perineuronal nets (PNN) were conducted, and pyramidal and dopamine neuron activity was recorded in vivo in the hippocampus and VTA respectively. Results Rats exposed to MAM gestationally were found to exhibit increased VTA DA neuron population activity, hyper-locomotion to amphetamine, and disruption in novel object recognition as adults. In contrast, exposure to either the antianxiety agent diazepam (PD31-40) or environmental enrichment (PD 21–40) prepubertally prevented this occurrence. Furthermore, combined footshock + restraint administered at PD31-40 in normal rats lead to a similar pathology in the adult. In contrast, combined stressors administered at adults (PD65-75) led to a short-term attenuation of DA activity similar to that observed in depression models. However, if the developmental critical period was re-opened in adults using either VPA or SAHA to resemble the prepubertal state, combined stressors now led to a persistent loss of PV-PNN labeling in the hippocampus, resulting in persistent hippocampal hyperactivity and a persistent increase in VTA DA neuron activity. Conclusions These data demonstrate that the timing of environmental stress is critical in determining the pathophysiological consequences. The fact that MAM can be circumvented via alleviation of stress prepubertally and that prepubertal stress can lead to a similar pathophysiology suggests that the predisposition to schizophrenia is based on increased impact of stress prepubertally, when the PV neurons are in a vulnerable state. In contrast, in the adult when PV neurons have a protective PNN, the same stressors now lead to a depressive state. However, reopening the critical period via histone deacetylase inhibition now causes the adult rat to be susceptible to stress-induced hyperdopaminergic phenotype. This suggests that depression and schizophrenia may share a common genetic predisposition leading to increased stress susceptibility at different developmental stages, with the pathophysiology dependent on the timing of the stressor.

AB  - Roman high- and low-avoidance (RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh) rats are selected and bred for extreme divergence in two-way active avoidance acquisition. In addition, compared to RLA/Verh rats, RHA/Verh rats are (behaviorally and physiologically) less anxious or reactive to stressors, show increased novelty (sensation)-seeking behavior as well as a higher preference for rewarding substances, and are usually less efficient in learning tasks not involving shock administration. The present article reviews evidence showing that neonatal handling and/or environmental enrichment leads to enduring effects (their magnitude frequently depending upon the rat line) on those behaviors. For example, it has been found that neonatal handling reduces most of the (behavioral and physiological) signs of emotionality/anxiety in RLA/Verh rats, while environmental enrichment increases their novelty seeking (also the case with RHA/Verh rats), saccharin and ethanol intake, and sensitivity to amphetamine. Finally, initial results (currently being further elaborated upon) support a preventive action of both environmental treatments on age-related impairments in learning a spatial, water maze task as well as on hippocampal neuronal atrophy.

AB  - Research and selected case studies concerning psychosocial prediction of sudden death are evaluated under three categories: sudden cardiac, sudden infant and sudden traumatic death. The psychosocial predictors reviewed include novelty-pre-exposure, control-helplessness, restraint, Type A behavior, life change, bereavement, denial, social support and contact, voodoo, psychiatric illness, mother infant separation, submission-defeat, housing, handling and environmental enrichment. Four of these predictors, controllability-helplessness, pre-exposure-novelty, depressive affect and physical restraint are repeatedly cited in both human and animal studies and their importance is critically evaluated. Methodological and substantive recommendations for future research are made and a discussion of possible mechanisms is presented (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Objective: The present study was aimed at the investigation of the effects of chronic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade applied during the late stage of brain maturation (days 20-30 after birth) and physical environment on affective behaviors during adulthood in socially isolated rats. Methods: In order to establish a social isolation model, the experimental animals were kept in individual cages, starting from 21 days of age till adulthood. The socially isolated rats, which were reared under standard and enriched environmental conditions, were administered with MK-801 (between days 20-30 after birth for a period of 10 days at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight, twice a day, by subcutaneous route). As from 3 months of age, the behavior of the adult rats was assessed using the open-field test, light-dark preference test and the elevated plus-maze test. Results: In the open-field test, it was observed that the frequency of rearing, considered as exploratory behavior, has increased significantly in the group administered with physiological saline and isolated under enriched physical environmental conditions compared to the group isolated under standard physical environmental conditions (p<0.01). In the elevated plus-maze test, the duration of the period the animals remained in the open arm has shortened in the group, which was administered with physiological saline and isolated under enriched physical environmental conditions in comparison to the animals exposed to standard physical environmental conditions (p<0.01). Compared to the group given physiological saline, in the group administered with MK-801 and reared in a standard physical environment, a significant decrease was observed in the same parameter (p<0,05). Conclusion: In conclusion, growth under enriched physical environmental conditions provides protection against both adulthood anxieties arising from NMDA receptor hypofunction in early childhood and emotional and behavioral abnormalities related to novel stimuli.

AB  - Amaç: Bu çalışmada, sosyal izolasyonlu sıçanlarda beynin son olgunlaşma döneminde (20-30.günlerde) uygulanan kronik NMDA reseptör blokajı ve zengin fizik çevrenin yetişkin dönem duygusal davranışları üzerine etkileri araştırılmıştır. Yöntem: Sosyal izolasyon modeli oluşturmak için denekler 21. günden yetişkin döneme kadar tekli kafeslerde barındırılmıştır. Sosyal izolasyon koşullarında, standart ve zengin fizik çevrede yetişen sıçanlara, MK-801enjeksiyonu uygulanmıştır (doğumdan sonra 20-30. günler arasında 10 gün süre ile 0,25 mg/kg vücut ağırlığı, günde iki kez, subkütan). 3 ayını dolduran yetişkin sıçanların davranışları açık alan, aydınlık-karanlık tercih ve yükseltilmiş artı düzenek testleri ile değerlendirilmiştir. Bulgular: Açık alan testine araştırmacı davranış olan serbest ayağa kalkma sıklığında, serum fizyolojik uygulanan zengin fizik çevre grubunda standart çevreye göre anlamlı artış görülmüştür (p<0,01). Yükseltilmiş artı düzenek testinde, açık kolda kalış süresi serum fizyolojik uygulanan zengin fizik çevre grubunda standart fizik çevre grubuna göre azalma göstermiştir (p<0,01) Aynı ölçütte MK-801 uygulanan standart fizik çevre grubunda da serum fizyolojik grubuna göre anlamlı azalma saptanmıştır (p<0,05). Sonuç: Sonuç olarak, zengin fizik çevre koşullarında yetişme, ergenlik öncesi dönem NMDA reseptör hipofonksiyonuna bağlı yetişkin dönem anksiyetesinden ve yeni uyaranla ilişkili duygusal ve davranışsal anormalliklerden korunmayı sağlamaktadır.

AB  - Health consequences of relative or absolute poverty constitute a definitive area of study in social medicine. As demonstrated in the extreme example of the Dutch Hunger Winter from 1944 to 1945, prenatal hunger can lead to adult schizophrenia and depression. A Norwegian study showed how childhood poverty resulted in a heightened risk of myocardial infarction in adulthood. In England, a study of extended impaired prenatal nutrition indicated three different types of increased cardiovascular risk at older ages. Current animal and human studies link both adverse and enriched environmental exposures to intergenerational transmission. We do not fully understand the molecular mechanisms for it; however, studies that follow up epigenetic marks within a generation combined with exploration of gametic epigenetic inheritance may help explain the prevalence of certain conditions such as cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia, and alcoholism, which have complex etiologies. Insights from these studies will be of great public health importance.
