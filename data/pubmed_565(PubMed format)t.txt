AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious mental illness. Increasing evidence 
      from both animal and human studies suggested that the gut microbiota might be 
      involved in the onset of depression via the gut-brain axis. However, the 
      mechanism in depression remains unclear. To explore the protein changes of the 
      gut-brain axis modulated by gut microbiota, germ-free mice were transplanted with 
      gut microbiota from MDD patients to induce depression-like behaviors. Behavioral 
      tests were performed following fecal microbiota transplantation. A quantitative 
      proteomics approach was used to examine changes in protein expression in the 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC), liver, cecum, and serum. Then differential protein 
      analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis were used to identify 
      microbiota-related protein modules. Our results suggested that gut microbiota 
      induced the alteration of protein expression levels in multiple tissues of the 
      gut-brain axis in mice with depression-like phenotype, and these changes of the 
      PFC and liver were model specific compared to chronic stress models. Gene 
      ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the protein changes of the gut-brain 
      axis were involved in a variety of biological functions, including metabolic 
      process and inflammatory response, in which energy metabolism is the core change 
      of the protein network. Our data provide clues for future studies in the 
      gut-brain axis on protein level and deepen the understanding of how gut 
      microbiota cause depression-like behaviors.

AB  - Stress is an important risk factor for depression. Emerging evidence supports the 
      hypothesis that stress-mediated neuroinflammation destroys brain function and 
      leads to anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. Previous studies of 
      stress-induced depression have mainly focused on pathological damage; however, 
      the rise of positive psychology has attracted the interest of many researchers in 
      environmental enrichment to promote stress resilience. The hippocampus is one of 
      the most severely damaged brain regions in stress-induced depression. In 
      addition, the hippocampus is one of the most unique regions in the brain, as new 
      neurons are produced in the adult hippocampus, a process known as adult 
      hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). AHN is an important core component of the 
      neurogenic hypothesis and has also become a major innovative breakthrough in 
      positive psychology, in which environmental enrichment mediates stress 
      resilience. Neuroinflammation, by activating microglia and releasing some 
      proinflammatory cytokines, is increasingly shown to be one of the key determinant 
      pathophysiological factors that negatively affects AHNand cognitive reserve. AHN 
      is mainly related to remodeling stress response mechanisms, such as memory 
      clearing, emotional control, and pattern separation, suggesting that a 
      correlation may exist between neuroinflammation and AHN in stress resilience. 
      Therefore, we summarized the previous research results to systematically expound 
      on the relationship between AHN, stress resilience, and neuroinflammation. We 
      hope this neurogenic hypothesis of positive psychology in stress-induced 
      depression will provide a new perspective for the study of depression and 
      antidepressant therapy.

AB  - We conducted genome-wide association analyses of over 250,000 participants of 
      European (EUR) and African (AFR) ancestry from the Million Veteran Program using 
      electronic health record-validated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
      diagnosis and quantitative symptom phenotypes. Applying genome-wide multiple 
      testing correction, we identified three significant loci in European case-control 
      analyses and 15 loci in quantitative symptom analyses. Genomic structural 
      equation modeling indicated tight coherence of a PTSD symptom factor that shares 
      genetic variance with a distinct internalizing (mood-anxiety-neuroticism) factor. 
      Partitioned heritability indicated enrichment in several cortical and subcortical 
      regions, and imputed genetically regulated gene expression in these regions was 
      used to identify potential drug repositioning candidates. These results validate 
      the biological coherence of the PTSD syndrome, inform its relationship to 
      comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders and provide new considerations for 
      treatment.

      pandemic and implications for working women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a vulnerable period of growth and enrichment along with 
      many physiological and psychological challenges. These changes can lead to 
      complications if compounded by external stress and anxiety. COVID-19 has emerged 
      as a chief stressor among the general population and is a serious threat among 
      vulnerable populations. Therefore, there is a need for stress management tools, 
      such as Yoga and physical exercises, both at home and at work. These can be 
      adopted during the pandemic with proper maintenance of social distancing. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compile literature that has reported the health 
      outcomes of Yoga intervention on pregnancy at the workplace and analyzes both the 
      restrictions as well as advantages of its beneficial effects in comparison to 
      physical exercises. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive literature review was conducted 
      utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar. The keywords used for the search include 
      "Yoga", "work", "complications", "physical exercise", "drugs" and "COVID" 
      indifferent permutations and combinations with "pregnancy". We compiled the 
      literature with respect to pregnancy complications and the effects of drugs, 
      physical activity and Yoga for preventing these complications. RESULTS: We noted 
      that pregnancy-related complications are becoming more prevalent because of a 
      sedentary lifestyle, restricted physical activity and growing stress. In such 
      situations, a home or workplace Yoga protocol can combine both exercise and 
      mindfulness-based alleviation of anxiety for both working and non-working women. 
      CONCLUSION: Yoga can be effective for combating stress and anxiety besides 
      boosting immunity in pregnant working women confronted with the COVID-19 
      pandemic.

TI  - Precision medicine for mood disorders: objective assessment, risk prediction, 
      pharmacogenomics, and repurposed drugs.

AB  - Mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorders) are prevalent and disabling. They 
      are also highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders. Currently there are 
      no objective measures, such as blood tests, used in clinical practice, and 
      available treatments do not work in everybody. The development of blood tests, as 
      well as matching of patients with existing and new treatments, in a precise, 
      personalized and preventive fashion, would make a significant difference at an 
      individual and societal level. Early pilot studies by us to discover blood 
      biomarkers for mood state were promising [1], and validated by others [2]. Recent 
      work by us has identified blood gene expression biomarkers that track 
      suicidality, a tragic behavioral outcome of mood disorders, using powerful 
      longitudinal within-subject designs, validated them in suicide completers, and 
      tested them in independent cohorts for ability to assess state (suicidal 
      ideation), and ability to predict trait (future hospitalizations for suicidality) 
      [3-6]. These studies showed good reproducibility with subsequent independent 
      genetic studies [7]. More recently, we have conducted such studies also for pain 
      [8], for stress disorders [9], and for memory/Alzheimer's Disease [10]. We 
      endeavored to use a similar comprehensive approach to identify more definitive 
      biomarkers for mood disorders, that are transdiagnostic, by studying mood in 
      psychiatric disorders patients. First, we used a longitudinal within-subject 
      design and whole-genome gene expression approach to discover biomarkers which 
      track mood state in subjects who had diametric changes in mood state from low to 
      high, from visit to visit, as measured by a simple visual analog scale that we 
      had previously developed (SMS-7). Second, we prioritized these biomarkers using a 
      convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach encompassing in a comprehensive 
      fashion prior published evidence in the field. Third, we validated the biomarkers 
      in an independent cohort of subjects with clinically severe depression (as 
      measured by Hamilton Depression Scale, (HAMD)) and with clinically severe mania 
      (as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)). Adding the scores from the 
      first three steps into an overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) score, we 
      ended up with 26 top candidate blood gene expression biomarkers that had a CFE 
      score as good as or better than SLC6A4, an empirical finding which we used as a 
      de facto positive control and cutoff. Notably, there was among them an enrichment 
      in genes involved in circadian mechanisms. We further analyzed the biological 
      pathways and networks for the top candidate biomarkers, showing that circadian, 
      neurotrophic, and cell differentiation functions are involved, along with 
      serotonergic and glutamatergic signaling, supporting a view of mood as reflecting 
      energy, activity and growth. Fourth, we tested in independent cohorts of 
      psychiatric patients the ability of each of these 26 top candidate biomarkers to 
      assess state (mood (SMS-7), depression (HAMD), mania (YMRS)), and to predict 
      clinical course (future hospitalizations for depression, future hospitalizations 
      for mania). We conducted our analyses across all patients, as well as 
      personalized by gender and diagnosis, showing increased accuracy with the 
      personalized approach, particularly in women. Again, using SLC6A4 as the cutoff, 
      twelve top biomarkers had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and 
      predicting depression after all four steps: NRG1, DOCK10, GLS, PRPS1, TMEM161B, 
      GLO1, FANCF, HNRNPDL, CD47, OLFM1, SMAD7, and SLC6A4. Of them, six had the 
      strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting both depression and mania, 
      hence bipolar mood disorders. There were also two biomarkers (RLP3 and SLC6A4) 
      with the strongest overall evidence for mania. These panels of biomarkers have 
      practical implications for distinguishing between depression and bipolar 
      disorder. Next, we evaluated the evidence for our top biomarkers being targets of 
      existing psychiatric drugs, which permits matching patients to medications in a 
      targeted fashion, and the measuring of response to treatment. We also used the 
      biomarker signatures to bioinformatically identify new/repurposed candidate 
      drugs. Top drugs of interest as potential new antidepressants were pindolol, 
      ciprofibrate, pioglitazone and adiphenine, as well as the natural compounds 
      asiaticoside and chlorogenic acid. The last 3 had also been identified by our 
      previous suicidality studies. Finally, we provide an example of how a report to 
      doctors would look for a patient with depression, based on the panel of top 
      biomarkers (12 for depression and bipolar, one for mania), with an objective 
      depression score, risk for future depression, and risk for bipolar switching, as 
      well as personalized lists of targeted prioritized existing psychiatric 
      medications and new potential medications. Overall, our studies provide objective 
      assessments, targeted therapeutics, and monitoring of response to treatment, that 
      enable precision medicine for mood disorders.

AB  - Previous research suggests an association of loneliness and social isolation 
      (LNL-ISO) with schizophrenia. Here, we demonstrate a LNL-ISO polygenic score 
      contribution to schizophrenia risk in an independent case-control sample 
      (N = 3,488). We then subset schizophrenia predisposing variation based on its 
      effect on LNL-ISO. We find that genetic variation with concordant effects in both 
      phenotypes shows significant SNP-based heritability enrichment, higher polygenic 
      contribution in females, and positive covariance with mental disorders such as 
      depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcohol 
      dependence, and autism. Conversely, genetic variation with discordant effects 
      only contributes to schizophrenia risk in males and is negatively correlated with 
      those disorders. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate a plausible 
      bi-directional causal relationship between LNL-ISO and schizophrenia, with a 
      greater effect of LNL-ISO liability on schizophrenia than vice versa. These 
      results illustrate the genetic footprint of LNL-ISO on schizophrenia.

AB  - Individual variation in responses to commonly used tests of anxiety and spatial 
      memory is often reported. While this variation is frequently considered to be 
      'noise', evidence suggests that it is, at least partially, related to consistent 
      individual differences in behavioral responses (i.e., personality). The same 
      tests used to assess anxiety are often used to profile personality traits, but 
      personality differences are rarely considered when testing treatment differences 
      in anxiety. Focusing on the rat literature, we describe fundamental principles 
      involved in anxiety and spatial memory tests and we discuss how personality 
      differences and housing conditions can influence behavioral responses in these 
      tests. We propose that an opportunity exists to increase stress resiliency in 
      environmentally sensitive individuals by providing environmental enrichment. We 
      conclude by discussing different approaches to incorporating personality measures 
      into the design and analysis of future studies; given the potential that 
      variation masks research outcomes, we suggest that a strategy which considers the 
      individual and its housing can contribute to improving research reproducibility.

AB  - Feline idiopathic cystitis is a widespread disease in small animal clinics, which 
      mainly presents with urinary signs like dysuria, stranguria, hematuria, 
      pollakiuria, and periuria. The etiopathogenesis of the disease may involve 
      interactions between the environmental stressors, neuroendocrine system and 
      bladder of affected cats. Diagnostic biomarkers have not been tested in clinical 
      studies though they are theoretically feasible, and since the clinical signs of 
      the disease assemble those of other feline lower urinary diseases, its diagnosis 
      is a procedure of exclusion. The primary treatment of the disease is long-term 
      multimodal environmental modification (or enrichment) while anti-anxiety drugs 
      and nutritional supplements are recommended for chronic recurrent cases. Still, 
      many medicines need to be evaluated for their efficacy and safety. This review 
      aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of feline idiopathic 
      cystitis by summarizing and updating studies concerning the prevalence, risk 
      factors, etiological hypotheses, diagnostic procedures, possible treatments, and 
      prognosis of the disease.

TI  - A network pharmacology study with molecular docking to investigate the 
      possibility of licorice against posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 1763-1777
LID - 10.1007/s11011-021-00816-2 [doi]
AB  - Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that has a 
      debilitating effect on a person's quality of life and leads to a high 
      socioeconomic burden. Licorice has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective and 
      antidepressant-like effects, but little is known about its effects for the 
      treatment of PTSD. The present study aimed to explore the potential of licorice 
      for PTSD therapy using a network pharmacology approach with molecular docking 
      studies. The compounds of licorice were obtained from databases with screening by 
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation. Genes 
      associated with compounds or PTSD were obtained from public databases, and the 
      genes overlapping between licorice compounds and PTSD were compared by Venn 
      diagram. A network of medicine-ingredients-targets-disease was constructed, 
      visualized, and analyzed using cytoscape software. Protein-protein interactions, 
      gene ontology, pathway enrichment and molecular docking were performed to 
      evaluate the effect of licorice for the treatment of PTSD. 69 potential compounds 
      were screened after ADME evaluation. A total of 81 compound-related genes and 566 
      PTSD-related genes were identified in the databases with 27 overlapping genes. 
      Licorice compounds (e.g., medicarpin, 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone, 
      shinpterocarpin, formononetin, licochalcone a) and target proteins (e.g., ESR1, 
      PTGS2, NOS2, and ADRB2) with high degree in the network were involved in G 
      protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways at the postsynaptic/synaptic 
      membrane. Moreover, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, calcium signaling, 
      cholinergic synapse, serotonergic synapse and adrenergic signaling in 
      cardiomyocytes may play important roles in the treatment of PTSD by licorice. 
      This study provides molecular evidence of the beneficial effects of licorice for 
      the treatment of PTSD.

TI  - Ginsenoside Rg1 Reduced Microglial Activation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction to 
      Alleviate Depression-Like Behaviour Via the GAS5/EZH2/SOCS3/NRF2 Axis.
PG  - 2855-2873
LID - 10.1007/s12035-022-02740-7 [doi]
AB  - Ginsenoside Rg1 is the principal active ingredient in ginseng. The antidepressant 
      effects of Rg1 have been validated; however, the specific underlying mechanism of 
      this effect needs further research. Rats were subjected to the chronic restraint 
      stress (CRS) depression model. Rg1, or a positive control drug, was administered 
      to the rats. Depression-like behaviours were evaluated through behavioural 
      experiments. Cytokine, mRNA, protein, ATP, and mitochondria DNA levels were 
      detected using the indicated methods. Lentivirus-packaged plasmids were injected 
      into the rat brain for GAS5 overexpression or knockdown. In vitro mitochondrial 
      dysfunction was evaluated by detecting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and 
      mitochondrial membrane potential. Direct interaction between GAS5 and EZH2 was 
      validated by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assay. The enrichment of 
      EZH2 and H3K27me3 was evaluated through chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      quantitative real-time PCR. Rg1 treatment alleviated depression-like behaviours, 
      microglial activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in CRS rats. Similarly, GAS5 
      knockdown revealed a similar protective effect of Rg1 treatment. GAS5 
      overexpression in the rat brain compromised the protective effect of Rg1 
      treatment. Moreover, Rg1 treatment or GAS5 knockdown attenuated microglial 
      activation and mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro. Mechanically, GAS5 was 
      suppressed SOCS3 and NRF2 expression by facilitating EZH2-mediated 
      transcriptional repression. Rg1 attenuated microglial activation and improved 
      mitochondrial dysfunction in depression by downregulating GAS5 expression. 
      Mechanically, GAS5 might regulate microglial activation and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction via the epigenetic suppression of NRF2 and SOCS3.

AB  - Depression is currently the leading cause of disability around the world. We 
      conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in a sample of 58 depression 
      score-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, aiming to detect specific epigenetic 
      variants potentially related to depression and further integrate with gene 
      expression profile data. Association between the methylation level of each CpG 
      site and depression score was tested by applying a linear mixed effect model. 
      Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed for gene 
      expression data. The association of DNA methylation levels of 66 CpG sites with 
      depression score reached the level of P < 1 × 10(-4). These top CpG sites were 
      located at 34 genes, especially PTPRN2, HES5, GATA2, PRDM7, and KCNIP1. Many 
      ontology enrichments were highlighted, including Notch signaling pathway, 
      Huntington disease, p53 pathway by glucose deprivation, hedgehog signaling 
      pathway, DNA binding, and nucleic acid metabolic process. We detected 19 
      differentially methylated regions (DMRs), some of which were located at GRIK2, 
      DGKA, and NIPA2. While integrating with gene expression data, HELZ2, PTPRN2, 
      GATA2, and ZNF624 were differentially expressed. In WGCNA, one specific module 
      was positively correlated with depression score (r = 0.62, P = 0.002). Some 
      common genes (including BMP2, PRDM7, KCNIP1, and GRIK2) and enrichment terms 
      (including complement and coagulation cascades pathway, DNA binding, neuron fate 
      specification, glial cell differentiation, and thyroid gland development) were 
      both identified in methylation analysis and WGCNA. Our study identifies specific 
      epigenetic variations which are significantly involved in regions, functional 
      genes, biological function, and pathways that mediate depression disorder.

AB  - Stress exposure can produce profound changes in physiology and behavior that can 
      impair health and well-being. Of note, stress exposure is linked to anxiety 
      disorders and depression in humans. The widespread impact of these disorders 
      warrants investigation into treatments to mitigate the harmful effects of stress. 
      Pharmacological treatments fail to help many with these disorders, so recent work 
      has focused on non-pharmacological alternatives. One of the most promising of 
      these alternatives is environmental enrichment (EE). In rodents, EE includes 
      social, physical, and cognitive stimulation for the animal, in the form of larger 
      cages, running wheels, and toys. EE successfully reduces the maladaptive effects 
      of various stressors, both as treatment and prophylaxis. While we know that EE 
      can have beneficial effects under stress conditions, the morphological and 
      molecular mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects are still not well 
      understood. EE is known to alter neurogenesis, dendrite development, and 
      expression of neurotrophic growth factors, effects that vary by type of 
      enrichment, age, and sex. To add to this complexity, EE has differential effects 
      in different brain regions. Understanding how EE exerts its protective effects on 
      morphological and molecular levels could hold the key to developing more targeted 
      pharmacological treatments. In this review, we summarize the literature on the 
      morphological and molecular consequences of EE and stress in key emotional 
      regulatory pathways in the brain, the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and 
      amygdala. The similarities and differences among these regions provide some 
      insight into stress-EE interaction that may be exploited in future efforts toward 
      prevention of, and intervention in, stress-related diseases.

TI  - Cultural trauma and epigenetic inheritance.
PG  - 1763-1777
LID - 10.1017/S0954579418001153 [doi]
AB  - The question of whether and how the effects of cultural trauma can be transmitted 
      intergenerationally from parents to offspring, or even to later generations, has 
      evoked interest and controversy in academic and popular forums. Recent 
      methodological advances have spurred investigations of potential epigenetic 
      mechanisms for this inheritance, representing an exciting area of emergent 
      research. Epigenetics has been described as the means through which environmental 
      influences "get under the skin," directing transcriptional activity and 
      influencing the expression or suppression of genes. Over the past decade, this 
      complex environment-biology interface has shown increasing promise as a potential 
      pathway for the intergenerational transmission of the effects of trauma. This 
      article reviews challenges facing research on cultural trauma, biological 
      findings in trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, and putative epigenetic 
      mechanisms for transmission of trauma effects, including through social, 
      intrauterine, and gametic pathways. Implications for transmission of cultural 
      trauma effects are discussed, focused on the relevance of cultural narratives and 
      the possibilities of resilience and adaptivity.

TI  - Parvalbumin interneuron alterations in stress-related mood disorders: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 100380

LID - 100380
AB  - Stress-related psychiatric disorders including depression involve complex 
      cellular and molecular changes in the brain, and GABAergic signaling dysfunction 
      is increasingly implicated in the etiology of mood disorders. Parvalbumin 
      (PV)-expressing neurons are fast-spiking interneurons that, among other roles, 
      coordinate synchronous neuronal firing. Mounting evidence suggests that the PV 
      neuron phenotype is altered by stress and in mood disorders. In this systematic 
      review, we assessed PV interneuron alterations in psychiatric disorders as 
      reported in human postmortem brain studies and animal models of environmental 
      stress. This review aims to 1) comprehensively catalog evidence of PV cell 
      function in mood disorders (humans) and stress models of mood disorders 
      (animals); 2) analyze the strength of evidence of PV interneuron alterations in 
      various brain regions in humans and rodents; 3) determine whether the modulating 
      effect of antidepressant treatment, physical exercise, and environmental 
      enrichment on stress in animals associates with particular effects on PV 
      function; and 4) use this information to guide future research avenues. Its 
      principal findings, derived mainly from rodent studies, are that stress-related 
      changes in PV cells are only reported in a minority of studies, that positive 
      findings are region-, age-, sex-, and stress recency-dependent, and that 
      antidepressants protect from stress-induced apparent PV cell loss. These 
      observations do not currently translate well to humans, although the postmortem 
      literature on the topic remains limited.

TI  - Enrichment for Laboratory Zebrafish-A Review of the Evidence and the Challenges.
LID - 10.3390/ani11030698 [doi]
LID - 698
AB  - Good practice for the housing and care of laboratory zebrafish Danio rerio is an 
      increasingly discussed topic, with focus on appropriate water quality parameters, 
      stocking densities, feeding regimes, anaesthesia and analgesia practices, methods 
      of humane killing, and more. One area of current attention is around the 
      provision of environmental enrichment. Enrichment is accepted as an essential 
      requirement for meeting the behavioural needs and improving the welfare of many 
      laboratory animal species, but in general, provision for zebrafish is minimal. 
      Some of those involved in the care and use of zebrafish suggest there is a 'lack 
      of evidence' that enrichment has welfare benefits for this species, or cite a 
      belief that zebrafish do not 'need' enrichment. Concerns are also sometimes 
      raised around the practical challenges of providing enrichments, or that they may 
      impact on the science being undertaken. However, there is a growing body of 
      evidence suggesting that various forms of enrichment are preferred by zebrafish 
      over a barren tank, and that enriched conditions can improve welfare by reducing 
      stress and anxiety. This review explores the effects that enrichment can have on 
      zebrafish behaviour, physiology and welfare, and considers the challenges to 
      facilities of providing more enrichment for the zebrafish they house.

AB  - The development of new pharmacological therapies starts with target discovery. 
      Finding new therapeutic targets for anxiety disorders is a difficult process. 
      Most of the currently described drugs for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
      are based on the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. The mechanism of action of 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was already described in 1977 (Benkert et 
      al., 1977). Now, almost 40 years later, we still rely on the same mechanism of 
      action and more effective pharmacological therapies, based on other working 
      mechanisms, are not on the market yet. Finding new molecular switches that upon 
      modulation cure or alleviate the disorder is hampered by a lack of valid animal 
      models. Many of the characteristics of psychiatric disorders are typically human 
      and hence animal models feature only part of the underlying pathology. In this 
      review we define a set of criteria for animal models of PTSD. First, we describe 
      the symptomatology and pathology of PTSD and the current pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological treatment options. Next, we compare three often-used animal 
      models and analyze how these models comply with the set of criteria. Finally, we 
      discuss how resolving the underlying mechanisms of effective non-pharmacological 
      treatments (environmental enrichment, re-exposure) may aid therapeutic target 
      discovery.

AB  - As any new parent knows, having a baby provides opportunities for enrichment, 
      learning and stress - experiences known to change the adult brain. Yet 
      surprisingly little is known about the effects of maternal experience, and even 
      less about the effects of paternal experience, on neural circuitry not directly 
      involved in parenting. Here we discuss how caregiving and the accompanying 
      experiential and hormonal changes influence the hippocampus and prefrontal 
      cortex, brain regions involved in cognition and mood regulation. A better 
      understanding of how parenting impacts the brain is likely to help in devising 
      strategies for treating parental depression, a condition that can have serious 
      cognitive and mental health consequences for children.

AB  - Research on the work-family interface began in the 1960s and has grown 
      exponentially ever since. This vast amount of research, however, has had 
      relatively little impact on workplace practice, and work-family conflict is at an 
      all-time high. We review the work-family research to date and propose that a 
      shift of attention is required, away from the individual experience of work and 
      family and toward understanding how identity and status are defined at work. 
      Several factors enshrine cherished identities around current workplace norms. The 
      work devotion schema demands that those who are truly committed to their work 
      will make it the central or sole focus of their lives, without family demands to 
      distract them. Importantly, the work devotion schema underwrites valued class and 
      gender identities: Work devotion is a key way of enacting elite class status and 
      functions as the measure of a man--the longer the work hours and higher the 
      demand for his attention, the better. Advocating change in the way work is done 
      and life is lived meets resistance because it places these cherished identities 
      at risk. Resistance to these identity threats keeps current workplace norms in 
      place. This is why even the business case-which shows that current practices are 
      not economically efficient-fails to persuade organizations to enact change. What 
      is needed now is sustained attention to the implicit psychological infrastructure 
      that cements the mismatch between today's workplace and today's workforce.

TI  - Uncovering the active components, prospective targets, and molecular mechanism of 
      Baihe Zhimu decoction for treating depression using network pharmacology-based 
      analysis.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Baihe Zhimu decoction (BZD) is a classical 
      traditional Chinese medicinal herbal formula. It consists of two herbal 
      medicines, Rhizoma Anemarrhenae (Zhimu), the rhizomes of Anemarrhena 
      asphodeloides Bge. (Liliaceae), and Bulbus Lilii (Baihe), the bulbs of Lilium 
      brownii var. Viridulum Baker (Liliaceae). BZD has been widely used in China to 
      treat depression and verified to be effective without evident side effects. AIM 
      OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to elucidate the active components, 
      potential targets, and molecular mechanism of Baihe Zhimu decoction for treating 
      depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this research, a chronic unpredictable mild 
      stress (CUMS) mice was first established to evaluate the pharmacological effects 
      of BZD for treating depression. A component database was then constructed for 
      BZD. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS) technique was used to identify 
      the components in BZD and blood-absorbed components. Further screening and 
      validation of protein targets were performed by molecule docking. The 
      component-target binding affinity was validated by surface plasmon resonance 
      analysis (SPR) assay. The related pathways were predicted by Kyoto Encyclopedia 
      of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Relative proteins in the 
      predicted pathways were finally assessed by Western blot. RESULTS: The 
      pharmacology evaluation experiment demonstrated that BZD could improve 
      depressive-like behavior, inhibit the hippocampal secretion of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines and reduce neuronal apoptosis in CUMS mice model. A component database 
      containing 163 components and a target database covering 1286 proteins were 
      constructed. HPLC-QTOF-MS assay identified twenty-six components from BZD and ten 
      components absorbed into rat plasma after an intragastric treatment with BZD. 
      Next, 56 underlying targets were screened out by a virtual high-throughput 
      screening approach. Twenty-seven of them were further screened out and confirmed 
      by molecular docking. Afterward, a component-target network was established, and 
      the component-protein binding affinities were validated by SPR assays. By KEGG 
      pathway enrichment analysis, two signaling pathways PI3K/Akt and MAPK were 
      predicted as the potential signaling cascades. Finally, Western blot showed that 
      BZD dramatically reversed the suppression of PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway and the 
      activation of MAPK pathway in CUMS mice model. CONCLUSIONS: BZD demonstrated a 
      substantial pharmacological effect on CUMS mice model. Network pharmacology-based 
      analysis predicted that ten blood-absorbed components can act on 27 target 
      proteins. KEGG and Western blotting analysis suggested that BZD could exert 
      antidepressant effects by regulating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways.

TI  - Gene polymorphisms associated with temperament.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/01677063.2017.1324857 [doi]
AB  - When individuals are exposed to stressful environmental challenges, the response 
      varies widely in one or more of three components: psychology, behavior and 
      physiology. This variability among individuals can be defined as temperament. In 
      recent years, an increasing large body of evidence suggests that the dimensions 
      of temperament, as well as personality, psychological disorders and behavioral 
      traits, are influenced by genetic factors, and much of the variation appears to 
      involve variation in genes or gene polymorphisms in the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the behavior-controlling 
      neurotransmitter networks. Here, we review our current understanding of the 
      probabilistic impact of a number of candidate gene polymorphisms that control 
      temperament, psychological disorders and behavioral traits in animals and human, 
      including the gene polymorphisms related to corticotrophin-releasing hormone 
      (CRH) production and adrenal cortisol production involved in the HPA axis, and a 
      large number of gene polymorphisms in the dopaminergic and serotonergic 
      neurotransmitter networks. It will very likely to assist in diagnosis and 
      treatment of human relevant disorders, and provide useful contributions to our 
      understanding of evolution, welfare and conservation, for animals in the wild and 
      in production systems. Additionally, investigations of gene-gene and 
      gene-environment complex interactions in humans and animals need further clear 
      illustration.

TI  - Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern 
      separation.
PG  - 466-70
LID - 10.1038/nature09817 [doi]
AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique form of neural circuit plasticity that 
      results in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life. 
      Neurons that arise in adults (adult-born neurons) show heightened synaptic 
      plasticity during their maturation and can account for up to ten per cent of the 
      entire granule cell population. Moreover, levels of adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis are increased by interventions that are associated with beneficial 
      effects on cognition and mood, such as learning, environmental enrichment, 
      exercise and chronic treatment with antidepressants. Together, these properties 
      of adult neurogenesis indicate that this process could be harnessed to improve 
      hippocampal functions. However, despite a substantial number of studies 
      demonstrating that adult-born neurons are necessary for mediating specific 
      cognitive functions, as well as some of the behavioural effects of 
      antidepressants, it is unknown whether an increase in adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood. Here we show that 
      inducible genetic expansion of the population of adult-born neurons through 
      enhancing their survival improves performance in a specific cognitive task in 
      which two similar contexts need to be distinguished. Mice with increased adult 
      hippocampal neurogenesis show normal object recognition, spatial learning, 
      contextual fear conditioning and extinction learning but are more efficient in 
      differentiating between overlapping contextual representations, which is 
      indicative of enhanced pattern separation. Furthermore, stimulation of adult 
      hippocampal neurogenesis, when combined with an intervention such as voluntary 
      exercise, produces a robust increase in exploratory behaviour. However, 
      increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis alone does not produce a behavioural 
      response like that induced by anxiolytic agents or antidepressants. Together, our 
      findings suggest that strategies that are designed to increase adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis specifically, by targeting the cell death of adult-born neurons or 
      by other mechanisms, may have therapeutic potential for reversing impairments in 
      pattern separation and dentate gyrus dysfunction such as those seen during normal 
      ageing.

TI  - Environmental enrichment decreases anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish larvae.
PG  - e22255
LID - 10.1002/dev.22255 [doi]

AB  - The development of anxiety disorders is often linked to individuals' negative 
      experience. In many animals, development of anxiety-like behavior is modeled by 
      manipulating individuals' exposure to environmental enrichment. We investigated 
      whether environmental enrichment during early ontogenesis affects anxiety-like 
      behavior in larval zebrafish. Larvae were exposed from hatching to either an 
      environment enriched with 3D-objects of different color and shape or to a barren 
      environment. Behavioral testing was conducted at different intervals during 
      development (7, 14, and 21 days post-fertilization, dpf). In a novel object 
      exploration test, 7 dpf larvae of the two treatments displayed similar avoidance 
      of the visual stimulus. However, at 14 and 21 dpf, larvae of the enriched 
      environment showed less avoidance, indicating lower anxiety response. Likewise, 
      larvae of the two treatments demonstrated comparable avoidance of a novel odor 
      stimulus at 7 dpf, with a progressive reduction of anxiety behavior in the 
      enriched treatment with development. In a control experiment, larvae treated 
      before 7 dpf but tested at 14 dpf showed the effect of enrichment on anxiety, 
      suggesting an early determination of the anxiety phenotype. This study confirms a 
      general alteration of zebrafish anxiety-like behavior due to a short enrichment 
      period in first days of life.

AB  - One hallmark of psychiatric conditions is the vast continuum of individual 
      differences in susceptibility vs. resilience resulting from the interaction of 
      genetic and environmental factors. The environmental enrichment paradigm is an 
      animal model that is useful for studying a range of psychiatric conditions, 
      including protective phenotypes in addiction and depression models. The major 
      question is how environmental enrichment, a non-drug and non-surgical 
      manipulation, can produce such robust individual differences in such a wide range 
      of behaviors. This paper draws from a variety of published sources to outline a 
      coherent hypothesis of inoculation stress as a factor producing the protective 
      enrichment phenotypes. The basic tenet suggests that chronic mild stress from 
      living in a complex environment and interacting non-aggressively with 
      conspecifics can inoculate enriched rats against subsequent stressors and/or 
      drugs of abuse. This paper reviews the enrichment phenotypes, mulls the 
      fundamental nature of environmental enrichment vs. isolation, discusses the most 
      appropriate control for environmental enrichment, and challenges the idea that 
      cortisol/corticosterone equals stress. The intent of the inoculation stress 
      hypothesis of environmental enrichment is to provide a scaffold with which to 
      build testable hypotheses for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying these protective phenotypes and thus provide new therapeutic targets 
      to treat psychiatric/neurological conditions.

TI  - PTSD, major depression, and advanced transcriptomic age in brain tissue.
PG  - 824-834
LID - 10.1002/da.23289 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychiatric disorders have been associated with advanced epigenetic 
      age in DNA methylation, yet this relationship has not been studied in the brain 
      transcriptome. We examined transcriptomic age using an RNA-based algorithm 
      recently developed by Ren and Kuan ("RNAAgeCalc") and the associations between 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and 
      alcohol use disorder with age-adjusted RNA age ("RNA age residuals") in three 
      brain regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
      (vmPFC), and motor cortex. METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to measure gene 
      expression in postmortem brain tissue from the VA National PTSD Brain Bank 
      (n = 94; 59% male). RESULTS: Linear models revealed that diagnoses of PTSD and/or 
      MDD were positively associated with RNA age residuals in vmPFC only 
      (p-adj = 0.012). Three genes in the RNAAgeCalc algorithm (KCNJ16, HYAL2, and 
      CEBPB) were also differentially expressed in association with PTSD/MDD in vmPFC 
      (p-adj = 6.45E-05 to 0.02). Enrichment analysis revealed that inflammatory and 
      immune-related pathways were overrepresented (p-adj < 0.05) among the 43 genes in 
      RNAAgeCalc that were also at least nominally associated with PTSD/MDD in vmPFC 
      relative to the 448 RNAAgeCalc genes. Endothelial and mural cells were negatively 
      associated with RNA age residuals in vmPFC (both p-adj = 0.028) and with PTSD/MDD 
      (both p-adj = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the importance of 
      inflammation and immune system dysregulation in the link between psychopathology 
      and accelerated cellular aging and raise the possibility that blood-brain barrier 
      degradation may play an important role in stress-related accelerated brain aging.

      comorbidities.
PG  - 436-468
LID - 10.1016/j.ibneur.2022.10.012 [doi]
AB  - This review discusses the long-term effects of early-life environment on 
      epileptogenesis, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities with an emphasis on 
      the absence epilepsy. The WAG/Rij rat strain is a well-validated genetic model of 
      absence epilepsy with mild depression-like (dysthymia) comorbidity. Although 
      pathologic phenotype in WAG/Rij rats is genetically determined, convincing 
      evidence presented in this review suggests that the absence epilepsy and 
      depression-like comorbidity in WAG/Rij rats may be governed by early-life events, 
      such as prenatal drug exposure, early-life stress, neonatal maternal separation, 
      neonatal handling, maternal care, environmental enrichment, neonatal sensory 
      impairments, neonatal tactile stimulation, and maternal diet. The data, as 
      presented here, indicate that some early environmental events can promote and 
      accelerate the development of absence seizures and their neuropsychiatric 
      comorbidities, while others may exert anti-epileptogenic and disease-modifying 
      effects. The early environment can lead to phenotypic alterations in offspring 
      due to epigenetic modifications of gene expression, which may have maladaptive 
      consequences or represent a therapeutic value. Targeting DNA methylation with a 
      maternal methyl-enriched diet during the perinatal period appears to be a new 
      preventive epigenetic anti-absence therapy. A number of caveats related to the 
      maternal methyl-enriched diet and prospects for future research are discussed.

      strategies.
PG  - 181-4
AB  - Contending with stressful situations in the workplace is a common occurrence for 
      all health care providers. Stress has numerous devastating effects on the 
      workplace environment, as well as upon individuals who become victims of stress. 
      However, enhancing psychological hardiness may facilitate an individual's ability 
      to deal with workplace stress. Psychological hardiness, a personality style 
      consisting of commitment, control and challenge, encourages human survival and 
      the enrichment of life through development. This article provides an overview of 
      psychological hardiness and workplace stress, and proposes strategies that one 
      can use to enhance commitment, control and challenge in an effort to reduce the 
      impact of stress.

AB  - Communication between the nervous and the immune systems suffers impairment with 
      aging, which explains the altered homeostasis and the resulting increase of 
      morbidity and mortality in aged subjects. In humans, rats and specially in mice, 
      we have proposed several models to study this fact. The established models of 
      premature aging have been mice and humans with poor response to stress and 
      anxiety versus subjects of the same chronological age without that 
      characteristic, isolation, males versus females, menopausal models (in rodents 
      after ovariectomy) and obesity. In all cases, the prematurely aged animals suffer 
      an alteration of the nervous system (shown by behavioral tests) and 
      immunosenescence as well as oxidative and inflammatory stress, which is followed 
      by early mortality. In addition, in the above-mentioned models and in normal 
      chronological aging, we have observed the effect of several lifestyle strategies, 
      such as ingestion of adequate amounts of antioxidants, performance of moderate 
      physical exercise, and different kinds of environmental enrichment, which improve 
      the function of the immune cells and their redox state as well as animal 
      behavior. Therefore, they retard the aging process and seem to increase the 
      longevity of the individuals.

TI  - Therapeutic and protective effect of environmental enrichment against psychogenic 
      and neurogenic stress.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has beneficial neurobiological, physiological and 
      behavioral effects. The purpose of the present paper is to review the animal 
      research literature pertaining to the impact of EE on altering physiological and 
      behavioral anxiety outcomes. Evidence supports the view that EE attenuates 
      responses to certain anxiety provoking situations, and that these effects persist 
      over time. Specifically, EE attenuates behavioral anxiety-type responses and 
      endocrine responses mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      evoked by psychogenic and/or neurogenic stressors. EE is not only able to protect 
      from excessive anxiety in response to a present stressor, but also attenuates the 
      enduring or persistent effects engendered by past psychogenic stressor(s) such as 
      prenatal stress or neonatal maternal separation. It is noteworthy that the 
      protective effects of EE are particularly apparent in animals that are highly 
      anxious or when the task is highly challenging for the subject. Various 
      mechanisms of action of EE have been proposed, ranging from behavioral/cognitive 
      to cellular/molecular processes. A pronounced variability in the enrichment 
      protocols used by different investigators may account for some of the 
      inconsistencies noted in the effect of EE on behavioral (e.g. anxiety) and 
      endocrine (e.g. plasma corticosterone) responses. Although the occasional 
      inconsistencies highlight the need for further research, a preponderance of the 
      animal research data indicates that EE exerts therapeutic and protective 
      (anxiolytic) effects against (a) impending threat, (b) enduring effects of past 
      stressor(s) and (c) subsequent stressors.

      Challenges.
PG  - 141-150

AB  - Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are the closest animal models to humans regarding 
      genetics, physiology and behavior. Therefore, NHPs are usually a critical 
      component in translational research projects aimed at developing therapeutics, 
      vaccines, devices or other interventions aimed at preventing, curing or 
      ameliorating human disease. NHPs are often used in conjunction with other animal 
      models, such as rodents, and results obtained using NHPs must often be used as 
      the final criterion for establishing the potential efficacy of a pharmaceutical 
      or vaccine before transition to human clinical trails. In some cases, NHPs may be 
      the only relevant animal models for a particlular translational study. This issue 
      of the ILAR journal brings together, in one place, articles that discuss the use 
      of NHP models for studying human diseases that are highly prevalent and that 
      cause extraordinary human suffering and financial and social burdens. Topics 
      covered in detail include: tuberculosis; viral hepatitis; HIV/AIDS; 
      neurodegenerative disorders; Substance abuse disorders; vision and prevention of 
      blindness; disorder associated with psychosocial processes, such as anxiety, 
      depression and loneliness; cardiovascular disease; metabolic disease, such as 
      obesity and metabolic syndrome; respiratory disease; and female reproduction, 
      prenatal development and women's health. Proper husbandry of NHPs that reduces 
      stress and maintains animal health is critical for the development of NHP models. 
      This issue of the journal includes a review of procedures for environmental 
      enrichment, which helps assure animal health and wellbeing. Taken together, these 
      articles provide detailed reviews of the use of NHP models for translational 
      investigations and discuss successes, limitations, challenges and opportunities 
      associated with this research.

TI  - Rare copy number variation in posttraumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 5062-5069
LID - 10.1038/s41380-022-01776-4 [doi]
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heritable (h(2) = 24-71%) psychiatric 
      illness. Copy number variation (CNV) is a form of rare genetic variation that has 
      been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, but no large-scale 
      investigation of CNV in PTSD has been performed. We present an association study 
      of CNV burden and PTSD symptoms in a sample of 114,383 participants (13,036 cases 
      and 101,347 controls) of European ancestry. CNVs were called using two calling 
      algorithms and intersected to a consensus set. Quality control was performed to 
      remove strong outlier samples. CNVs were examined for association with PTSD 
      within each cohort using linear or logistic regression analysis adjusted for 
      population structure and CNV quality metrics, then inverse variance weighted 
      meta-analyzed across cohorts. We examined the genome-wide total span of CNVs, 
      enrichment of CNVs within specified gene-sets, and CNVs overlapping individual 
      genes and implicated neurodevelopmental regions. The total distance covered by 
      deletions crossing over known neurodevelopmental CNV regions was significant 
      (beta = 0.029, SE = 0.005, P = 6.3 × 10(-8)). The genome-wide neurodevelopmental 
      CNV burden identified explains 0.034% of the variation in PTSD symptoms. The 
      15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion region was significantly associated with PTSD 
      (beta = 0.0206, SE = 0.0056, P = 0.0002). No individual significant genes 
      interrupted by CNV were identified. 22 gene pathways related to the function of 
      the nervous system and brain were significant in pathway analysis (FDR q < 0.05), 
      but these associations were not significant once NDD regions were removed. A 
      larger sample size, better detection methods, and annotated resources of CNV are 
      needed to explore this relationship further.

TI  - Biologically meaningful scents: a framework for understanding predator-prey 
      research across disciplines.
PG  - 98-114
LID - 10.1111/brv.12334 [doi]
AB  - Fear of predation is a universal motivator. Because predators hunt using stealth 
      and surprise, there is a widespread ability among prey to assess risk from 
      chemical information - scents - in their environment. Consequently, scents often 
      act as particularly strong modulators of memory and emotions. Recent advances in 
      ecological research and analytical technology are leading to novel ways to use 
      this chemical information to create effective attractants, repellents and 
      anti-anxiolytic compounds for wildlife managers, conservation biologists and 
      health practitioners. However, there is extensive variation in the design, 
      results, and interpretation of studies of olfactory-based risk discrimination. To 
      understand the highly variable literature in this area, we adopt a 
      multi-disciplinary approach and synthesize the latest findings from neurobiology, 
      chemical ecology, and ethology to propose a contemporary framework that accounts 
      for such disparate factors as the time-limited stability of chemicals, highly 
      canalized mechanisms that influence prey responses, and the context within which 
      these scents are detected (e.g. availability of alternative resources, perceived 
      shelter, and ambient physical parameters). This framework helps to account for 
      the wide range of reported responses by prey to predator scents, and explains, 
      paradoxically, how the same individual predator scent can be interpreted as 
      either safe or dangerous to a prey animal depending on how, when and where the 
      cue was deposited. We provide a hypothetical example to illustrate the most 
      common factors that influence how a predator scent (from dingoes, Canis dingo) 
      may both attract and repel the same target organism (kangaroos, Macropus spp.). 
      This framework identifies the catalysts that enable dynamic scents, odours or 
      odorants to be used as attractants as well as deterrents. Because effective scent 
      tools often relate to traumatic memories (fear and/or anxiety) that cause future 
      avoidance, this information may also guide the development of appeasement, 
      enrichment and anti-anxiolytic compounds, and help explain the observed variation 
      in post-traumatic-related behaviours (including post-traumatic stress disorder, 
      PTSD) among diverse terrestrial taxa, including humans.

AB  - Environmental stimulation throughout development adjusts the neurobehavioral 
      systems involved in learning, memory and defensive responses. 
      Environment-mediated phenotypic plasticity can be considered from two different, 
      yet complementary, viewpoints. On one hand, the possibility that environmental 
      interventions protect against the effects of genetic and/or acquired 
      vulnerabilities, offers unprecedented avenues towards the elaboration and 
      refinement of therapeutic strategies. On the other hand, an accurate 
      understanding of the adaptive mechanisms regulating the interaction between an 
      experimental subject and its environment may substantially benefit the quality of 
      experimental data. Here we review experimental evidence showing that enriched 
      environment can be beneficial in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative 
      disorders implicating the monoamine systems where it can (i) compensate for 
      impairments in animal models of schizophrenia, Huntington's, and Parkinson's 
      diseases; (ii) increase resistance to the addictive properties of psychostimulant 
      drugs; (iii) level-out the consequences of prenatal stress in animal models of 
      depression. Additionally we discuss why some of the effects of environmental 
      enrichment question the validity of current animal models of mental disorders.

AB  - A suitable enriched environment favors development but can also influence 
      behavior and neuronal circuits throughout development. Studies have shown that 
      environmental enrichment (EE) can be used as an essential tool or combined with 
      conventional treatments to improve psychiatric and neurological symptoms, 
      including major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
      Both disorders affect a significant percentage of the wofrld's population and 
      have complex pathophysiology. Moreover, the available treatments for MDD and ASD 
      are still inadequate for many affected individuals. Experimental models 
      demonstrate that EE has significant positive effects on behavioral modulation. In 
      addition, EE has effects on neurobiology, including improvement in synaptic 
      connections and neuroplasticity, modulation of neurotransmissions, a decrease in 
      inflammation and oxidative stress, and other neurobiology effects that can be 
      involved in the pathophysiology of MDD and ASD. Thus, this review aims to 
      describe the leading behavioral and neurobiological effects associated with EE in 
      MDD and ASD.

TI  - Role of MicroRNAs in Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders.
PG  - 185-219
LID - 10.1007/7854_2019_109 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs as critical regulators of gene expression important for functions 
      including neuronal development, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity have 
      been linked with the regulation of neurobiological systems that underlie anxiety 
      processing in the brain. In this chapter, we give an update on associative 
      evidence linking regulation of microRNAs with anxiety- and trauma-related 
      disorders. Moving beyond correlative research, functional studies have emerged 
      recently that explore causal relationships between microRNA expression and 
      anxiety-like behavior. It has been demonstrated that experimental up- or 
      downregulation of the candidate microRNAs in important nodes of the anxiety 
      neurocircuitry can indeed modulate anxiety-related behavior in animal models. 
      Improved methodologies for assessing microRNA-mediated modulation have aided such 
      functional studies, revealing a number of anxiety-regulating microRNAs including 
      miR-15a, miR-17-92, miR-34, miR-101, miR-124, miR-135, and miR-155. Important 
      functional target genes of these identified microRNAs are associated with 
      specific neurotransmitter/neuromodulator signaling, neurotrophin (e.g., BDNF) 
      expression and other aspects of synaptic plasticity, as well as with 
      stress-regulatory/hypothalamic-pituitary-axis function. Furthermore, microRNAs 
      have been revealed that are regulated in distinct brain regions following various 
      anxiety-attenuating strategies. These include pharmacological treatments such as 
      antidepressants and other drugs, as well as non-pharmacological interventions 
      such as fear extinction/exposure therapy or positive stimuli such as exposure to 
      environmental enrichment. These are first indications for a role for microRNAs in 
      the mechanism of action of anxiolytic treatments. As research continues, there is 
      much hope that a deeper understanding of the microRNA-mediated mechanisms 
      underlying anxiety-related disorders could open up possibilities for future novel 
      biomarker and treatment strategies.

TI  - Musical Dogs: A Review of the Influence of Auditory Enrichment on Canine Health 
      and Behavior.
LID - 10.3390/ani10010127 [doi]
LID - 127
AB  - Music therapy yields many positive health outcomes in humans, but the effects of 
      music on the health and welfare of nonhuman animals vary greatly with the type of 
      music played, the ethology of the species, and the personality and learning 
      history of individual animals. One context in which music therapy may be used to 
      enhance animal welfare is to alleviate stress in domestic environments. Here, we 
      review studies of the effects of music exposure on dogs as a case study for the 
      implementation of music therapy in veterinary medicine. Nine reports of 
      experimental testing for the therapeutic effects of music on dogs were found, 
      with most of these studies focusing on changes in behavior. Overall, exposure to 
      classical music appears to have a calming influence on dogs in stressful 
      environments, with no additional benefit observed from any music purposely 
      designed for dogs (specifically "Through a dog's ear"). Given the cost 
      effectiveness and ease of implementation, music therapy holds promise in 
      veterinary medicine and animal welfare. However, to address precise research 
      questions, further studies must use clearly defined characteristics of stimulus 
      music in the experimental design, and consider the variability of each individual 
      animal's physical characteristics and past experience in the selection of 
      candidates.

TI  - Investigating the Behavior and Personality Structure of the Aldabra Tortoise 
      during Human Interactions and Training Events.
LID - 10.3390/ani12040419 [doi]
LID - 419
AB  - Human-animal interaction (HAI) can be valuable for captive animals, and many 
      zoo-housed species benefit from interactions with their keepers. There is also an 
      increasing body of evidence that some animal species possess personalities that 
      are temporally consistent. However, the majority of zoo research, particularly on 
      personality and HAI, traditionally has focused on mammals, and there are 
      comparatively fewer studies on reptiles. Research was undertaken at the Faunistic 
      Park Le Cornelle, Italy, to investigate the effects of approach tests and food 
      interaction events on 5 male and 5 female Aldabra tortoise (Aldrabrachelys 
      gigantea) behavior. During human-tortoise interactions, continuous focal sampling 
      of behavior took place. The behavioral differences between individual tortoises, 
      interaction type (approach or training) and person involved in the interaction 
      (keeper, vet, or observer) were analysed using general linear mixed-effects 
      models. The personality components of the tortoises were also quantified using 
      principal component analysis. Overall, the study revealed that individuals acted 
      significantly differently to one another, and that while females initially 
      appeared to display a greater number of shy behaviors, this was not consistent 
      across the group. PCA revealed two personality dimensions in the tortoises: 
      boldness and avoidance. Overall, the study revealed that the tortoises possessed 
      personalities that were independent of sex or scenario. The study also revealed 
      that many tortoises chose to interact with their keepers during training and 
      approach tests: this suggests that human-tortoise interactions may have some 
      enrichment value. Future research could quantify tortoise personality in other 
      scenarios such as in social interactions with other tortoises.

TI  - The environmental enrichment model revisited: A translatable paradigm to study 
      the stress of our modern lifestyle.
PG  - 2359-2392
LID - 10.1111/ejn.15160 [doi]
AB  - Mounting evidence shows that physical activity, social interaction and 
      sensorimotor stimulation provided by environmental enrichment (EE) exert several 
      neurobehavioural effects traditionally interpreted as enhancements relative to 
      standard housing (SH) conditions. However, this evidence rather indicates that SH 
      induces many deficits, which could be ameliorated by exposing animals to an 
      environment vaguely mimicking some features of their wild habitat. Rearing 
      rodents in social isolation (SI) can aggravate such deficits, which can be 
      restored by SH or EE. It is not surprising, therefore, that most preclinical 
      stress models have included severe and unnatural stressors to produce a stress 
      response prominent enough to be distinguishable from SH or SI-frequently used as 
      control groups. Although current stress models induce a stress-related phenotype, 
      they may fail to represent the stress of our urban lifestyle characterized by SI, 
      poor housing and working environments, sedentarism, obesity and limited access to 
      recreational activities and exercise. In the following review, we discuss the 
      stress of living in urban areas and how exposures to and performing activities in 
      green environments are stress relievers. Based on the commonalities between human 
      and animal EE, we discuss how models of housing conditions (e.g., SI-SH-EE) could 
      be adapted to study the stress of our modern lifestyle. The housing conditions 
      model might be easy to implement and replicate leading to more translational 
      results. It may also contribute to accomplishing some ethical commitments by 
      promoting the refinement of procedures to model stress, diminishing animal 
      suffering, enhancing animal welfare and eventually reducing the number of 
      experimental animals needed.

AB  - Prevention of stress-induced adverse effects is important for animals and humans 
      to maintain their quality of life (QOL). Stress decreases the productivity of 
      farm animals and induces abnormal behaviors, which is one of the major problems 
      in animal welfare. In humans, stress increases the risk of mental illness which 
      adversely impacts QOL. Stress is, thus, a common health problem for both animals 
      and humans, and stress prevention and promotion of stress resilience could 
      improve animal and human health and QOL. Among various stresses, psychosocial 
      stress experienced by individuals is particularly difficult to prevent and it 
      could, thus, prove beneficial to attempt to increase resilience to psychosocial 
      stress. There exist a few critical interventions for promoting such resilience, 
      environmental enrichment being one. However, this review describes recent 
      progress in nutritional interventions that could confer resilience to 
      psychosocial stress. The efficacy of this intervention is studied in the social 
      defeat model mouse, which is a standard model for studying psychosocial stress. 
      Several nutrients were found to rescue stress vulnerability using the models. 
      Furthermore, probiotics and prebiotics became crucial dietary interventions for 
      combating psychosocial stress. Collectively, dietary intake of appropriate 
      nutrients will be more important for maintaining QOL in animals and humans.

AB  - Postnatal development of the brain is characterized by sensitive windows during 
      which, local circuitry are drastically reshaped by life experiences. These 
      critical periods (CPs) occur at different time points for different brain 
      functions, presenting redundant physiological changes in the underlying brain 
      regions. Although circuits malleability during CPs provides a valuable window of 
      opportunity for adaptive fine-tuning to the living environment, this aspect of 
      neurodevelopment also represents a phase of increased vulnerability for the 
      development of a variety of disorders. Consistently, accumulating epidemiological 
      studies point to adverse childhood experience as a major risk factor for many 
      medical conditions, especially stress- and anxiety-related conditions. Thanks to 
      creative approaches to manipulate rodents' rearing environment, neurobiologist 
      have uncovered a pivotal interaction between CPs and early-life experiences, 
      offering an interesting landscape to improve our understanding of brain 
      disorders. In this short review, we discuss how early-life experience impacts 
      cellular and molecular players involved in CPs of development, translating into 
      long-lasting behavioral consequences in rodents. Bringing together findings from 
      multiple laboratories, we delineate a unifying theory in which systemic factors 
      dynamically target the maturation of brain functions based on adaptive needs, 
      shifting the balance between resilience and vulnerability in response to the 
      quality of the rearing environment.

TI  - Maintaining continuity of nutrient intake after weaning. I. Review of pre-weaning 
      strategies.
PG  - txab021
LID - 10.1093/tas/txab021 [doi]
LID - txab021
AB  - Weaning is a crucial phase of swine production marked by a multitude of 
      biological and environmental stressors, which have a significant impact on 
      immediate postweaning behavior and feed intake (FI). During this time, the 
      piglet's gastrointestinal (GI) system is also undergoing extensive epithelial, 
      immune, and nervous system development. In this review, our objective is to 
      describe the different preweaning strategies that can be used to minimize 
      nutrient intake disruption and improve FI in the immediate postweaning period. 
      Reducing nutrient disruption postweaning can be accomplished through the 
      implementation of management and nutritional strategies. Research consistently 
      demonstrates that weaning older, more developmentally mature pigs helps prevent 
      many of the adverse GI effects associated with weaning stress. Providing creep 
      feed to pigs during lactation is another reliable strategy that has been shown to 
      increase immediate postweaning FI by acclimating pigs to solid feed prior to 
      weaning. Likewise, socialization by allowing pigs to mix before weaning improves 
      social skills, minimizing mixing stress, and aggression-related injury 
      immediately postweaning. Supplemental milk replacer has also been shown to elicit 
      a positive response in preweaning growth performance, which may help to reduce 
      preweaning mortality. While socialization and milk replacer are acknowledged to 
      ease the weaning transition, these strategies have not been widely adopted due to 
      labor and application challenges. Additionally, the cost of milk replacer and 
      logistics of retrofitting farrowing houses to accommodate litter socialization 
      have limited adaptation. Further exploration of maternal nutrition strategies, 
      particularly fetal imprinting, is needed to better understand the implications of 
      perinatal learning. Other areas for future research include, combining 
      environmental enrichment with feeding strategies, such as large destructible 
      pellets or play feeders, as well as determining at what time point producers 
      should start socializing pigs before weaning. While more research is needed to 
      develop strategic preweaning management programs, many of the strategies 
      presented in this review provide opportunities for producers to minimize nutrient 
      intake disruption by preventing feed neophobia, reducing stress, and easing the 
      wean pig transition.

TI  - The fibroblast growth factor system and mood disorders.
PG  - 1128-35
AB  - Recent evidence now suggests the involvement of the fibroblast growth factor 
      (FGF) system in mood disorders. Specifically, several members of the FGF family 
      have been shown to be dysregulated in individuals with major depression. In this 
      review, we will introduce the FGF system in terms of structure and function 
      during development, in adulthood, and in various regions and cell types. We will 
      also review the FGF system as a mediator of neural plasticity. Furthermore, this 
      review will summarize animal as well as human studies. The majority of animal 
      studies have focused on stress, environmental enrichment, pharmacological 
      manipulations, and the hippocampus. By contrast, human studies have focused on 
      volumetric measurements, antidepressant literature, and, most recently, 
      post-mortem microarray experiments. In summary, a reduced tone in the FGF system 
      might alter brain development or remodeling and result in a predisposition or 
      vulnerability to mood disorders, including major depression.

AB  - The neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is critical in neural 
      circuit function and behavior, particularly in the context of stress, anxiety, 
      and addiction. Despite a wealth of preclinical evidence for the efficacy of CRF 
      receptor 1 antagonists in reducing behavioral pathology associated with alcohol 
      exposure, several clinical trials have had disappointing outcomes, possibly due 
      to an underappreciation of the role of biological variables. Although he National 
      Institutes of Health (NIH) now mandate the inclusion of sex as a biological 
      variable in all clinical and preclinical research, the current state of knowledge 
      in this area is based almost entirely on evidence from male subjects. 
      Additionally, the influence of biological variables other than sex has received 
      even less attention in the context of neuropeptide signaling. Age (particularly 
      adolescent development) and housing conditions have been shown to affect CRF 
      signaling and voluntary alcohol intake, and the interaction between these 
      biological variables is particularly relevant to the role of the CRF system in 
      the vulnerability or resilience to the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). 
      Going forward, it will be important to include careful consideration of 
      biological variables in experimental design, reporting, and interpretation. As 
      new research uncovers conditions in which sex, age, and environment play major 
      roles in physiological and/or pathological processes, our understanding of the 
      complex interaction between relevant biological variables and critical signaling 
      pathways like the CRF system in the cellular and behavioral consequences of 
      alcohol exposure will continue to expand ultimately improving the ability of 
      preclinical research to translate to the clinic. This article is part of the 
      special issue on Neuropeptides.

TI  - Providing Environmental Enrichment without Altering Behavior in Male and Female 
      Wistar Rats (Rattus norvegicus).

AB  - In research using animal models, subjects are commonly maintained under standard 
      housing conditions, mainly because of the idea that enhancing welfare conditions 
      could alter experimental data. Another common practice in many laboratories 
      relates to the preponderant use of males. Several reasons justifying this 
      practice include the rapid hormonal and endocrine change in females, which may 
      require a higher number of female animals to achieve more homogenous groups, 
      thereby creating a dilemma with the reduction principle in animal research. In 
      past decades, a relationship between enriched environments and enhanced cognitive 
      functions has been reported in rats, but many of those enriched environmental 
      protocols were not systematically or rigorously studied, leading to unexpected 
      effects on behavior. Here we report the effects of 4 types of housing conditions 
      (standard, structural changes, exercise, and foraging) in Wistar rats on anxiety 
      (elevated plus maze), exploratory (open field), and stress vulnerability (forced 
      swim test) responses. Sex was used as a blocking factor. Data show no effect of 
      housing conditions on anxiety and exploratory behaviors, but do show an effect on 
      stress responses. These results suggest the possibility of using a protocol for 
      environmental enrichment without concern about altering experimental data. From 
      this stand, new ways to enhance animal welfare in research laboratories could be 
      designed and implemented.

AB  - Social stress is associated with depression and anxiety, physiological 
      disruptions, and altered brain morphology in central stress circuitry across 
      development. Environmental enrichment strategies may improve responses to social 
      stress. Socially monogamous prairie voles exhibit analogous social and 
      emotion-related behaviors to humans, with potential translational insight into 
      interactions of social stress, age, and environmental enrichment. This study 
      explored the effects of social isolation and environmental enrichment on 
      behaviors related to depression and anxiety, physiological indicators of stress, 
      and dendritic structural changes in amygdala and hippocampal subregions in young 
      adult and aging prairie voles. Forty-nine male prairie voles were assigned to one 
      of six groups divided by age (young adult vs. aging), social structure (paired 
      vs. isolated), and housing environment (enriched vs. non-enriched). Following 4 
      weeks of these conditions, behaviors related to depression and anxiety were 
      investigated in the forced swim test and elevated plus maze, body and adrenal 
      weights were evaluated, and dendritic morphology analyses were conducted in 
      hippocampus and amygdala subregions. Environmental enrichment decreased 
      immobility duration in the forced swim test, increased open arm exploration in 
      the elevated plus maze, and reduced adrenal/body weight ratio in aging and young 
      adult prairie voles. Age and social isolation influenced dendritic morphology in 
      the basolateral amygdala. Age, but not social isolation, influenced dendritic 
      morphology in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Environmental enrichment did not 
      influence dendritic morphology in either brain region. These data may inform 
      interventions to reduce the effects of social stressors and age-related central 
      changes associated with affective behavioral consequences in humans.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is widely used to improve welfare and behavioral 
      performance of animal species. It ensures housing of laboratory animals in 
      environments with space and complexity that enable the expression of their normal 
      behavioral repertoire. Auditory enrichment by exposure to classical music 
      decreases abnormal behaviors and endocrine stress responses in humans, non-humans 
      primates, and rodents. However, little is known about the role of auditory 
      enrichment in laboratory zebrafish. Given the growing importance of zebrafish for 
      neuroscience research, such studies become critical. To examine whether auditory 
      enrichment by classical music can affect fish behavior and physiology, we exposed 
      adult zebrafish to 2 h of Vivaldi's music (65-75 dB) twice daily, for 15 days. 
      Overall, zebrafish exposed to such auditory stimuli were less anxious in the 
      novel tank test and less active, calmer in the light-dark test, also affecting 
      zebrafish physiological (immune) biomarkers, decreasing peripheral levels of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the activity of some CNS genes, without 
      overt effects on whole-body cortisol levels. In summary, we report that 
      twice-daily exposure to continuous musical sounds may provide benefits over the 
      ongoing 50-55 dB background noise of equipment in the laboratory setting. 
      Overall, our results support utilizing auditory enrichment in laboratory 
      zebrafish to reduce stress and improve welfare in this experimental aquatic 
      organism.

AB  - Monitoring the actual nutrition of various groups of the population of the 
      Russian Federation indicates the presence of pronounced deficiencies of essential 
      micronutrients, and above all vitamins and biologically active compounds. 
      Deficiency of many micronutrients is a risk factor for the development of a 
      number of conditions (anxiety, depression, etc.) and non-communicable diseases 
      (cardiovascular, cognitive and neuromuscular disorders). It reduces the 
      effectiveness of the treatment of injuries and wounds, and also leads to a 
      negative effect on the antioxidant protection of the body and a more pronounced 
      response to stress. To prevent long-term consequences, the population is 
      primarily provided with psychological assistance, not always paying due attention 
      to healthy nutrition. The aim of the research was to substantiate and develop 
      vitamin-mineral supplements (VMS) for special purposes to restore impaired 
      functions in various population groups in extreme situations, including those 
      located in the zones of a special military operation. Material and methods. A 
      review of the literature on the problem in recent years was carried out using the 
      databases of the RSCI, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, PubMed by the keywords "B 
      vitamins", "vitamin-mineral supplement", "military personnel", "mood", 
      "efficiency", "depression", "refugees", «multivitamin», «conflict», "efficiency". 
      Results. In an emergency situation, under conditions of high physiological 
      (physical and neuropsychiatric) stress, the requirements in micronutrients 
      increase. An inverse association between micronutrient status and the development 
      of symptoms of depression, sleep disturbance has been found. The analysis of the 
      data on the administration of VMS with different composition in the nutrition of 
      the population and law enforcement officers showed the effectiveness of its 
      intake for all persons in the zone of military conflicts. At the same time, VMS 
      should contain a complete set of vitamins, in doses for B vitamins 200-300% of 
      the recommended daily intake (RDI), vitamin D and other vitamins in a dose of 
      100%, magnesium, zinc, iodine, iron - in doses up to 50% of RDI. The 
      administration of such VMS for 1-6 months provides an increase in blood serum 
      vitamin level and antioxidant activity, leads to an improvement in functional 
      adaptation and military professional performance, increases self-esteem of 
      health, reduces symptoms of stress and anxiety, improves the mood. Conclusion. 
      The expediency of including VMS for special purposes in the nutrition of both 
      military personnel and the entire population in the zone of military conflict has 
      been proved. Enrichment of the diet with micronutrients is a reliable non-drug 
      prevention of health disorders caused by stress in emergency.

AB  - Rats are widely used animal models for biological psychiatry and neuroscience. 
      Laboratory rats are typically housed in impoverished sensory environments. The 
      lack of species-typical sensory environment might radically change the response 
      of individual animals to stressful and/or threatening episodes. In this report, 
      we demonstrate that behavioral and neural sequelae of chronic stress were 
      modified by sensory environment of adult male rats. This includes effects of 
      stress on the density of spines on CA3 hippocampal neurons, hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and abundance of glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors. 
      Enrichment also reduced depression-like behavior in a forced swim task. Stress 
      and sensory enrichment evoked opposing effects on all the above endpoints. The 
      sensory enrichment used in this report is of a relatively short duration provided 
      during adulthood. This period excludes critical windows of greater plasticity 
      during pre- and peripubertal stages. Our results suggest that standard housing 
      practices for laboratory rats remain austere concerning sensory requirements of 
      this species. Thus, even a moderate sensory enrichment is capable of reducing 
      high stress-sensitivity and depressive-like behavior in standard laboratory rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex psychiatric 
      disorder that occurs with relatively high frequency after deployment to warzones 
      (∼10%). While twin studies have estimated the heritability to be up to 40%, thus 
      indicating a considerable genetic component in the etiology, the biological 
      mechanisms underlying risk and development of PTSD remain unknown. METHODS: Here, 
      we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS; N = 2,481) to identify genome 
      regions that associate with PTSD in a highly homogenous, trauma-exposed sample of 
      Danish soldiers deployed to war and conflict zones. We perform integrated 
      analyses of our results with gene-expression and chromatin-contact datasets to 
      prioritized genes. We also leverage on other large GWAS (N>300,000) to 
      investigate genetic correlations between PTSD and other psychiatric disorders and 
      traits. RESULTS: We discover, but do not replicate, one region, 4q31, close to 
      the IL15 gene, which is genome-wide significantly associated with PTSD. We 
      demonstrate that gene-set enrichment, polygenic risk score and genetic 
      correlation analyses show consistent and significant genetic correlations between 
      PTSD and depression, insomnia and schizophrenia. LIMITATIONS: The limited sample 
      size, the lack of replication, and the PTSD case definition by questionnaire are 
      limitations to the study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genetic 
      perturbations of inflammatory response may contribute to the risk of PTSD. In 
      addition, shared genetic components contribute to observed correlations between 
      PTSD and depression, insomnia and schizophrenia.

AB  - Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed 
      at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the 
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the 
      stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive 
      responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the 
      organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have 
      strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to 
      stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS), 
      these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response 
      associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion. 
      Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA 
      dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus 
      suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to 
      an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted 
      corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an 
      alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS 
      also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high 
      anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some 
      studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing, 
      male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent 
      tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood. 
      The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal 
      plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the 
      permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS 
      can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as 
      environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments. 
      Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown. 
      However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during 
      pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male 
      offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis 
      and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also 
      make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic 
      mechanisms.

TI  - Coping-Style Behavior Identified by a Survey of Parent-of-Origin Effects in the 
      Rat.
PG  - 3283-3291
LID - 10.1534/g3.118.200489 [doi]
AB  - In this study we investigate the effects of parent of origin on complex traits in 
      the laboratory rat, with a focus on coping style behavior in stressful 
      situations. We develop theory, based on earlier work, to partition heritability 
      into a component due to a combination of parent of origin, maternal, paternal and 
      shared environment, and another component that estimates classical additive 
      genetic variance. We use this theory to investigate the effects on heritability 
      of the parental origin of alleles in 798 outbred heterogeneous stock rats across 
      199 complex traits. Parent-of-origin-like heritability was on average 2.7fold 
      larger than classical additive heritability. Among the phenotypes with the most 
      enhanced parent-of-origin heritability were 10 coping style behaviors, with 
      average 3.2 fold heritability enrichment. To confirm these findings on coping 
      behavior, and to eliminate the possibility that the parent of origin effects are 
      due to confounding with shared environment, we performed a reciprocal F1 cross 
      between the behaviorally divergent RHA and RLA rat strains. We observed 
      parent-of-origin effects on F1 rat anxiety/coping-related behavior in the 
      Elevated Zero Maze test. Our study is the first to assess genetic 
      parent-of-origin effects in rats, and confirm earlier findings in mice that such 
      effects influence coping and impulsive behavior, and suggest these effects might 
      be significant in other mammals, including humans.

TI  - Conventional laboratory housing increases morbidity and mortality in research 
      rodents: results of a meta-analysis.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/s12915-021-01184-0 [doi]
LID - 15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 120 million mice and rats are used annually in research, 
      conventionally housed in shoebox-sized cages that restrict natural behaviours 
      (e.g. nesting and burrowing). This can reduce physical fitness, impair 
      thermoregulation and reduce welfare (e.g. inducing abnormal stereotypic 
      behaviours). In humans, chronic stress has biological costs, increasing disease 
      risks and potentially shortening life. Using a pre-registered protocol ( 
      https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/17955 ), this meta-analysis 
      therefore tested the hypothesis that, compared to rodents in 'enriched' housing 
      that better meets their needs, conventional housing increases stress-related 
      morbidity and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Comprehensive searches (via Ovid, 
      CABI, Web of Science, Proquest and SCOPUS on May 24 2020) yielded 10,094 
      publications. Screening for inclusion criteria (published in English, using mice 
      or rats and providing 'enrichments' in long-term housing) yielded 214 studies 
      (within 165 articles, using 6495 animals: 59.1% mice; 68.2% male; 31.8% 
      isolation-housed), and data on all-cause mortality plus five experimentally 
      induced stress-sensitive diseases: anxiety, cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
      depression and stroke. The Systematic Review Center for Laboratory animal 
      Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool assessed individual studies' risks of bias. 
      Random-effects meta-analyses supported the hypothesis: conventional housing 
      significantly exacerbated disease severity with medium to large effect sizes: 
      cancer (SMD = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.54-0.88); cardiovascular disease (SMD = 0.72, 95% 
      CI = 0.35-1.09); stroke (SMD = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.59-1.15); signs of anxiety 
      (SMD = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.56-1.25); signs of depression (SMD = 1.24, 95% 
      CI = 0.98-1.49). It also increased mortality rates (hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% 
      CI = 1.25-1.74; relative median survival = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.89-0.94). 
      Meta-regressions indicated that such housing effects were ubiquitous across 
      species and sexes, but could not identify the most impactful improvements to 
      conventional housing. Data variability (assessed via coefficient of variation) 
      was also not increased by 'enriched' housing. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional housing 
      appears sufficiently distressing to compromise rodent health, raising ethical 
      concerns. Results also add to previous work to show that research rodents are 
      typically CRAMPED (cold, rotund, abnormal, male-biased, poorly surviving, 
      enclosed and distressed), raising questions about the validity and 
      generalisability of the data they generate. This research was funded by NSERC, 
      Canada.

AB  - Antagonist and long-lasting environmental manipulations (EM) have successfully 
      induced or reduced the stress responses and quality of life of zebrafish. For 
      instance, environmental enrichment (EE) generally reduces anxiety-related 
      behaviours and improves immunity, while unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) and 
      aquarium-related stressors generate the opposite effects. However, there is an 
      absence of consistency in outcomes for some EM, such as acute exposure to 
      stressors, social enrichment and some items of structural enrichment. Therefore, 
      considering intraspecies variation (sex, personality, and strain), increasing 
      intervention complexity while improving standardisation of protocols and 
      contemplating the possibility that EE may act as a mild stressor on a spectrum 
      between too much (UCS) and too little (standard conditions) stress intensity or 
      stimulation, would reduce the inconsistencies of these outcomes. It would also 
      help explore the mechanism behind stress resilience and to standardise EM 
      protocols. Thus, this review critically analyses and compares knowledge existing 
      over the last decade concerning environmental manipulations for zebrafish and the 
      influences that sex, strain, and personality may have on behavioural, 
      physiological, and fitness-related responses.

TI  - The differential effects of brief environmental enrichment following social

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) in rodents is associated with a wide range of 
      physiological, affective, and cognitive benefits. A seemingly opposite housing 
      condition, social isolation (SI), is used as a rodent model of stress, negatively 
      affecting several neurobiological mechanisms and hampering cognitive performance. 
      Experimental designs that involve switching between these housing conditions 
      produced mixed results. We evaluated different behavioral and cognitive effects 
      of brief EE following long-term, SI-induced stress. We revealed the influence of 
      enrichment after 30 days of isolation on behavioral despair, anxiety-like 
      behavior, and spatial working memory in adult male Wistar rats and found a 
      substantial anxiolytic effect in the experimental (SI to EE) group. 
      Interestingly, rats exposed to EE also showed increased behavioral despair 
      compared with the control (continuous SI) group. There was no difference in 
      spatial working memory performance at the end of a 5-day water Y-maze (WYM) test. 
      However, the SI to EE animals displayed better memory performance in the first 2 
      days of the WYM, indicating faster learning. In line with this difference, we 
      recorded significantly more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos+) cells in the 
      retrosplenial and perirhinal cortices of the SI to EE animals. The lateral and 
      basolateral nuclei of the amygdala showed no such difference. These results 
      suggest that brief enrichment following isolation stress leads to differential 
      results in affective and cognitive systems.

TI  - Altering BDNF expression by genetics and/or environment: impact for emotional and

PG  - 599-611

AB  - According to the "neurotrophin hypothesis", brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      (BDNF) is an important candidate gene in depression. Moreover, environmental 
      stress is known to represent a risk factor in the pathophysiology and treatment 
      of this disease. To elucidate, whether changes of BDNF availability signify cause 
      or consequence of depressive-like alterations, it is essential to look for 
      endophenotypes under distinct genetic conditions (e.g. altered BDNF expression). 
      Furthermore it is crucial to examine environment-driven BDNF regulation and its 
      effect on depressive-linked features. Consequently, gene × environment studies 
      investigating prospective genetic mouse models of depression in different 
      environmental contexts become increasingly important. The present review 
      summarizes recent findings in BDNF-mutant mice, which have been controversially 
      discussed as models of depression and anxiety. It furthermore illustrates the 
      potential of environment to serve as naturalistic stressor with the potential to 
      modulate the phenotype in wildtype and mutant mice. Moreover, environment may 
      exert protective effects by regulating BDNF levels as attributed to 
      "environmental enrichment". The effect of this beneficial condition will also be 
      discussed with regard to probable "curative/therapeutic" approaches.

AB  - Major depressive disorders (MDDs) and anxiety and stress-related disorders 
      (ASRDs) have overlapping symptoms and high rates of comorbidity. However, the 
      underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we aimed to examine whether 
      MDD and ASRD share genetic risk factors utilizing recent large-scale genome-wide 
      association studies (GWASs). To examine the genetic overlap between MDD and ASRD, 
      we applied genetic correlation analysis to analyze GWAS summary statistics for 
      MDD (16,823 cases and 25,632 controls) and ASRD (12,665 cases and 19,225 
      controls). We found positive and significant genetic correlations between MDD and 
      ASRD (GNOVA: rho = 0.59, se = 0.01, P = 5.32 × 10(-45)). Our latent causal 
      variable (LCV) analysis indicated the genetic correlation result from pleiotropic 
      effects (gcp = -0.56, se = 0.31, P(gcp) = 0.1). Based on pleiotropic enrichment, 
      we performed a cross-trait meta-analysis of MDD and ASRD GWAS and fine-mapped the 
      identified loci. In total, we identified 5 pleiotropic loci simultaneously 
      associated with MDD and ASRD at P < 5 × 10(-8). At the gene level, we further 
      demonstrated that MDD- and ASRD-inferred gene expression overlapped across 48 
      tissues and highlighted the NUP210L gene as a potential mediator of the genetic 
      correlation. Our study highlights a shared underlying genetic risk for MDD and 
      ASRD, which may help to improve the understanding of high comorbidity and 
      overlapping genetic mechanisms between the two traits.

AB  - Glia are starting to be accepted as the equal of neurons. Their impact on 
      intelligence, environmental enrichment, and cerebral dominance forms the basis 
      for understanding the role of glia in stress. Along with neurons, astrocytes, 
      microglia, NG2 cells, and oligodendrocytes all contribute. Glia can even be 
      protective against drug abuse. Glial effects on depression, mood disorders and 
      schizophrenia are reviewed.

AB  - Preclinical studies have clearly indicated that offspring of mothers who suffered 
      sleep deprivation during pregnancy exhibit anxiety, depression-like behaviors, 
      and cognitive deficits. The cognitive impairment induced by maternal sleep 
      deprivation (MSD) is currently poorly treated. Growing evidence indicates that an 
      enriched environment (EE) improves cognition function in models of Alzheimer's 
      disease, schizophrenia, and lipopolysaccharide. However, the effects of EE on 
      hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as synaptic plasticity markers 
      changes induced by MSD, are unclear. In the present study, pregnant CD-1 mice 
      were randomly divided into a control group, MSD group, and MSD+EE group. Two 
      different living environments, including standard environment and EE, were 
      prepared. When male and female offspring were 2 months, the open field test and 
      elevated plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behavior, and the Morris 
      water maze was used to evaluate hippocampal learning and memory. Western blotting 
      and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to 
      detect the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in 
      the hippocampus of offspring. The results revealed that MSD-induced offspring 
      showed anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, while EE alleviated 
      anxiety-like behavior and cognitive impairment in offspring of the MSD+EE group. 
      The cognitive impairment induced by MSD was associated with a decreased 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor and an increased Synaptotagmin-1, while EE 
      increased and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Synaptotagmin-1 in 
      the hippocampus of mice from the MSD+EE group, respectively. Taken together, we 
      can conclude that EE has beneficial effects on MSD-induced synaptic plasticity 
      markers changes and can alleviate anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive 
      impairment.

AB  - Laboratory male mice are often housed individually due to aggressive behavior or 
      experimental requirements, though social isolation can cause welfare issues. As a 
      strategy to refine housing of male mice, we introduce the separated pair housing 
      system. A perforated transparent wall divides the cage into two compartments and 
      allows olfactory, acoustic, and visual communication between the two mice but 
      prevents fighting and injuries. Long-term effects of separated pair housing on 
      well-being and distress of adult male C57BL/6JRj mice were investigated and 
      compared with both single- and group-housed mice. Behavioral analysis after eight 
      weeks in three different housing systems revealed no differences in burrowing 
      performance, social interaction, anxiety, and stress hormone concentrations. 
      However, pair-housed mice built more complex nests compared to single-housed mice 
      and the nest position suggested that pair-housed mice preferred the close 
      proximity to their cage mates. Moreover, pair-housed mice showed less locomotor 
      activity compared to group- and single-housed mice. Body weight was higher in 
      group-housed mice. All in all, no unambiguous long-term beneficial effects of 
      pair housing on the well-being were found. However, the findings emphasized that 
      effects of the housing systems on behavioral, physical, and biochemical 
      parameters must be considered in the design of animal experimental studies.

TI  - Neurogenesis along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus: are depression and 
      the action of antidepressants region-specific?

AB  - In recent years, both major depression and antidepressant therapy have been 
      linked to adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The hippocampus is not a homogeneous 
      brain area, and a converging body of evidence indicates a functional dissociation 
      along its septo-temporal axis, the dorsal part being involved more in 
      learning/memory and spatial navigation, while the ventral sub-region is linked 
      more to emotional behavior and regulation of the neuroendocrine stress axis. 
      Research has therefore been conducted in an attempt to relate effects of models 
      of depression and of antidepressant therapies to adult neurogenesis along the 
      septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. The present paper reviews the current 
      literature addressing this question and discusses the possible mechanisms 
      involved and the functional significance of such regional effects. This review 
      shows that animal models of depression elicit an effect restricted to the ventral 
      hippocampus more frequently than a dorsal-specific effect. However, this is also 
      stage specific, and concerns neurogenesis, rather than cell proliferation or 
      survival. Surprisingly, the same does not apply regarding the effects of 
      selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors that act in a more uniform way on dorsal 
      and ventral adult neurogenesis in most studies. Some recently introduced clinical 
      compounds (e.g., agomelatine) or putative antidepressants have a specific action 
      on the ventral sub-region, indicating that an action restricted to this part of 
      the brain may be sufficient to achieve remission. Finally, non-pharmacological 
      manipulations that are also endowed with antidepressant effects, such as 
      environmental enrichment or physical exercise, also act on both subdivisions, 
      although some studies pointed to specificity of dorsal neurogenesis. The 
      different treatments, acting either on the dorsal or on the ventral sub-regions, 
      could promote recovery by improving either ventral- or dorsal-related functions, 
      both contributing in a different way to treatment efficacy.

TI  - Satisfaction of farm animal behavioral needs in behaviorally restricted systems: 
      reducing stressors and environmental enrichment.
PG  - 634-8
LID - 10.1111/asj.12213 [doi]
AB  - In modern intensive husbandry, systems often restrict farm animal behavior. 
      Behavioral needs will be generated by external stimuli such as stressors deriving 
      from environmental factors or the method of animal care, or some internal factor 
      in farm animals. This means that behavioral restriction would induce 
      maladaptation to stressors or chronic stress. Such a risk of behavioral 
      restriction degrades an animal's physical and mental health and leads to economic 
      loss at a farm. Methods to reduce the risk of behavioral restrictions are to 
      ameliorate the source of a stressor through adequate animal management or to 
      carry out environmental enrichment. This review is intended to describe the 
      relation between animal management and behavioral needs from the perspective of 
      animal motivation.

AB  - Environmental enrichment effectively reduces anxiety-like indicators in animals, 
      a potential co-treatment for diseases that generate variations in basal anxiety, 
      such as alcoholism. Here we present an experimental design that allows 
      investigating the effect of enrichment on anxiety-related behaviors using 
      contextual aversive conditioning in zebrafish (Danio rerio). It was first 
      observed whether animals conditioned with an aversive stimulus (electroshock 
      paired with checked background tank) exhibited behavioral variations when 
      previously held in barren (BE) or enriched (EE) environment. Enrichment reduced 
      anxiety-like behaviors. Then, fish was exposed to four alcohol concentrations 
      (0.00%, 0.10%, 0.50%, and 1.00%) after being held in BE or EE, and contextual 
      fear conditioning was tested again. Fish showed dose-dependent and 
      enrichment-related variation in anxiety-like behavior. Together, these results 
      indicate that the experimental design in question is efficient in measuring 
      behavior related to BE and EE, and that enrichment seems to impair the 
      acquisition of dose-dependent effects of alcohol. Our results show that EE can 
      alleviate deleterious effects caused by traumatic events, but it should also 
      consider some effects of enrichment and alcohol exposure interaction.

TI  - Environmental enrichment as a strategy: Attenuates the anxiety and memory 
      impairment in social isolation stress.
PG  - 499-512
LID - 10.1002/jdn.10205 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social isolation (SI) early in life produces behavioral and cognitive 
      abnormalities. On the contrary, environmental enrichment (EE) offers beneficial 
      effects on brain plasticity and development. This study was designed to examine 
      how EE affects memory functions, anxiety level, and the expression levels of 
      memory/anxiety-related genes such as NR2A, NR2B, BDNF, and cFos in the 
      hippocampus of socially isolated rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar albino male 
      rats (n = 40) were separated into the five groups: Standard cage (SC), SI, EE, 
      SI + SC, and SI + EE group. For each group, eight rats were housed, either 
      grouped or isolated, in a standard or 3-week EE, respectively. Morris water maze 
      test (MWMT) was used for measuring the learning and memory function. Elevated 
      plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) were used for the evaluation of anxiety 
      behavior. Blood corticosterone level was evaluated by the ELISA method. The 
      expression levels of genes were measured by the RT-PCR method. RESULTS: Results 
      showed that EE increased memory performance in the SI group (p < 0.05). SI caused 
      anxiety while EE improved anxiety behavior (p < 0.05). There was no significant 
      difference between the groups in the OF test. Corticosterone levels did not 
      change between groups. BDNF expression level was downregulated in EE and SI + SC 
      compared with the SC group (respectively; p = 0.012; p = 0.011). NR2A, NR2B, and 
      cFos expression levels did not change between groups significantly. CONCLUSIONS: 
      SI impaired memory performance while EE has beneficial effects on memory in 
      socially isolated rats. EE alone was insufficient to cause alterations in the 
      memory performance. The therapeutic effects of EE became strengthened while 
      applied together with stress protocol. Together with improving the effectiveness 
      of memory function, EE has the potential to decrease anxiety behavior. EE seemed 
      to be the reason for decreasing in BDNF.

AB  - Maternal lifestyle affects both mother health and pregnancy outcome in humans. 
      Several studies have demonstrated that interventions oriented toward reducing 
      stress and anxiety have positive effects on pregnancy complications such as 
      preeclampsia, excessive gestational weight, gestational diabetes and preterm 
      birth. In this work, we showed that the environmental enrichment (EE), defined as 
      a noninvasive and biologically significant stimulus of the sensory pathway 
      combined with voluntary physical activity, prevented preterm birth (PTB) rate by 
      40% in an inflammatory mouse model induced by the systemic administration of 
      bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, we found that EE modulates 
      maternal metabolism and produces an anti-inflammatory environment that 
      contributes to pregnancy maintenance. In pregnant mice uterus, EE reduces the 
      expression of TLR4 and CD14 (the LPS receptor and its coactivator protein), 
      preventing the LPS-induced increase in PGE2 and PGF2α release and nitric oxide 
      synthase (NOS) activity. In cervical tissue, EE inhibits cervical ripening 
      events, such as PGE2 release, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 increased activity 
      and neutrophil recruitment, therefore conserving cervical function. It seems that 
      EE exposure could mimic the stress and anxiety-reducing techniques mentioned 
      above, explaining, at least partially, the beneficial effects of having a healthy 
      lifestyle before and during gestation. Furthermore, we propose that designing an 
      EE protocol for humans could be a noninvasive and preventive therapy for 
      pregnancy complications, averting pre-term birth occurrence and dreaded sequelae 
      that are present in the offspring born too soon.

AB  - The main aim of this chapter is to review preclinical studies that have evaluated 
      interventions which may aid in preventing or delaying age-related behavioural 
      decline. Animal models of Environmental Enrichment (EE) are useful for evaluating 
      the influence of cognitive, physical and social stimulation in mitigating 
      cognitive decline at different ages. The EE paradigm has been proposed as a 
      non-invasive treatment for alleviating age-related memory impairment and 
      neurodegenerative diseases. While in this complex environment, rodents can be 
      stimulated at different levels (physical, social, cognitive and sensorial), 
      although a synergism between all these components is likely to play an important 
      role. We will summarize available data relating to EE as a potential therapeutic 
      strategy that slows down or counteracts age-related cognitive and behavioural 
      changes. EE also alters physiological responses and induces neurobiological 
      changes such as stimulation of neurogenesis and neural plasticity. At the 
      behavioural level, EE improves learning and memory tasks and reduces anxiety. 
      Several variables seem to influence the behavioural and cognitive benefits 
      induced by EE, including the age at which animals are first exposed to EE, total 
      period during which animals are submitted to EE, gender, the cognitive task 
      evaluated, the drug administered and individual factors. Cognitive and physical 
      stimulation of animals in enriched experimental environments may lead to a better 
      understanding of factors that promote the formation of cognitive reserve (CR) and 
      a healthier life in humans. In the present chapter we review the potential 
      benefits of EE in aged rodents and in animal models of Alzheimer Disease (AD). 
      Results obtained in preclinical models of EE may be relevant to future research 
      into mental and neurodegenerative diseases, stress, aging and development of 
      enviromimetics. Finally, we outline the main limitations of EE studies 
      (variability between laboratories, difficulty of separating the different 
      components of EE, gender of experimental subjects, individual differences in the 
      response to EE), evaluating the potential benefits of enriched environments and 
      the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie them. We conclude that there are 
      experimental data which demonstrate the cognitive benefits of rearing rodents in 
      enriched environments and discuss their implication for clarifying which 
      variables contribute to the formation of the CR.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Two High-Risk 
      Populations.
PG  - 197-207
LID - 10.1017/thg.2017.12 [doi]
AB  - Mexican Americans (MAs) and American Indians (AIs) constitute conspicuously 
      understudied groups with respect to risk for post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD), especially in light of findings showing racial/ethnic differences in 
      trauma exposure and risk for PTSD. The purpose of this study was to examine 
      genetic influences on PTSD in two minority cohorts. A genome-wide association 
      study (GWAS) with sum PTSD symptoms for trauma-exposed subjects was run in each 
      cohort. Six highly correlated variants in olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily 
      L member 1 (OR11L1) were suggestively associated with PTSD in the MA cohort. 
      These associations remained suggestively significant after permutation testing. A 
      signal in a nearby olfactory receptor on chromosome 1, olfactory receptor family 
      2 subfamily L member 13 (OR2L13), tagged by rs151319968, was nominally associated 
      with PTSD in the AI sample. Although no variants were significantly associated 
      after correction for multiple testing in a meta-analysis of the two cohorts, 
      pathway analysis of the top hits showed an enrichment cluster of terms related to 
      sensory transduction, olfactory receptor activity, G-protein coupled receptors, 
      and membrane. As previous studies have proposed a role for olfaction in PTSD, our 
      results indicate this influence may be partially driven by genetic variation in 
      the olfactory system.

TI  - Long-lasting housing environment manipulation and acute loss of environmental 
      enrichment impact BALB/c mice behaviour in multiple functional domains.
PG  - 1118-1140
LID - 10.1111/ejn.15602 [doi]
AB  - Understanding environmental influences on individuals' behaviour is challenging. 
      Here we have investigated the housing impact of 9 weeks of enriched environment 
      (EE) and social isolation (SI) and the impact of abrupt deprivation of EE 
      (enrichment removal: ER) on BALB/c mice. Compared with the widely used C57BL/6 
      strain in research, BALB/c synthesises serotonin less efficiently due to a 
      genetic variation and thus may potentially represent human populations at higher 
      risk of stress-related disorders. We assessed the effects of EE and SI by 
      conducting a behavioural test battery and the effects of acute ER by monitoring 
      homecage activities and social behaviour. We found that EE and SI impact BALB/c's 
      physiological states and behavioural performances from lower to higher cognitive 
      processes: increased body weight, increased rectal temperature, altered 
      performance in motor and sensory tasks, the activity level in a novel environment 
      and altered performance in tests of anxiety-like behaviour, stress-coping 
      strategies and learning and memory. Furthermore, acute ER triggered 
      stress/frustration-like behaviour in BALB/c, with increased aggression, increased 
      social distancing and disrupted daily/nightly activities. Our results demonstrate 
      that long-lasting housing manipulation such as EE and SI, impact behaviour via 
      multilayered processes over a wide range of functional domains, and unforeseen 
      change to a negative environment, ER, is a major stressor that causes behavioural 
      and psychological consequences through environment-gene interactions, a model of 
      direct relevance to human health.

AB  - Significant loss produces the highest degree of stress and compromised well-being 
      in humans. Current rodent models of stress involve the application of physically 
      or psychologically aversive stimuli, but do not address the concept of loss. We 
      developed a rodent model for significant loss, involving removal of long-term 
      access to a rewarding enriched environment. Our results indicate that removal 
      from environmental enrichment produces a profound behavioral and physiological 
      phenotype with depression-like qualities, including helplessness behavior, 
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis dysregulation and overeating. 
      Importantly, this enrichment removal phenotype was prevented by antidepressant 
      treatment. Furthermore, the effects of enrichment removal do not occur following 
      relief from chronic stress and are not duplicated by loss of exercise or social 
      contact.

      minority students-historically underrepresented groups-and the influence of 
      program and personal variables on their research-career intent and self-efficacy 
      beliefs. We studied the program variables of research experience, research 
      duration, and mentor influence; and the personal variables of race, gender, 
      family, and peers. Using the conceptual framework of planned behavior theory and 
      social cognitive career theory, we interviewed students from underrepresented 
      groups participating in BCEPs that offered research experience for short duration 
      (Group A), long duration (Group B), and no research experience (Group C). We 
      utilized Atlas Ti, a qualitative methodological software tool, to analyze the 
      interview responses. Students choosing a BCEP with research experience cited 
      "opportunity to gain experience" and "interest or curiosity in research" as 
      motivators. Duration of research experience had a positive relationship with 
      enhancement in research skills and self-efficacy beliefs, but did not change the 
      initial research-career intent of these BCEP participants. The study revealed an 
      interesting and unexpected theme of "perceived deterrents" to a career in 
      research that included stress of competition (e.g. grants), the instability of 
      projects, and the isolation of scientific research. Importantly, the study 
      findings indicate the need to reform program design and science policies that 
      challenge the current biomedical workforce and dissuade interested students from 
      underrepresented groups from entering the field.

AB  - Depression is caused by a variety of factors, especially stressful life events. 
      Chronic stress-induced depression has detrimental effects on hippocampal 
      integrity. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a beneficial intervention for 
      improving anxiety, fear, and stress. We aimed to investigate the antidepressive 
      effects of EE in a depressive rat model (DEP) that was subjected to chronic 
      stress. The control group ( n = 10) was kept under normal conditions, while 
      depressive rats ( n = 8 per group) were randomized into DEP, DEP + EE, and DEP + 
      fluoxetine (Flx) groups. DEP + EE/Flx groups were exposed to standard housing and 
      EE or Flx, respectively. The behavioral tests showed that hopelessness and 
      anxiety were decreased in DEP + EE and DEP + Flx groups compared with the DEP 
      group ( p < .05). Similarly, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor 
      and tryptophan hydroxylase was significantly higher in the DEP + EE and DEP + Flx 
      ( p < .05) groups. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine 
      receptor kinase B were also significantly higher in the DEP + EE and DEP + Flx 
      groups compared with the DEP group ( p < .05). Our findings can serve as a 
      foundation for future investigations examining the effects of environmental 
      improvement and physical exercise in patients with depression. This study 
      suggests that EE may be useful for mitigating the detrimental effects of chronic 
      stress in patients with depression.

AB  - Previous research from our laboratory has shown that exposure to chronic 
      psychosocial stress increased voluntary ethanol consumption and preference as 
      well as acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in 
      mice. This study was done to determine whether an enriched environment could have 
      "curative" effects on chronic psychosocial stress-induced ethanol intake and CPP. 
      For this purpose, experimental mice "intruders" were exposed to the chronic 
      subordinate colony (CSC) housing for 19 consecutive days in the presence of an 
      aggressive "resident" mouse. At the end of that period, mice were tested for 
      their anxiety-like behavior using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test then housed 
      in a standard or enriched environment (SE or EE respectively). Anxiety and 
      ethanol-related behaviors were investigated using the open field (OF) test, a 
      standard two-bottle choice drinking paradigm, and the CPP procedure. As expected, 
      CSC exposure increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced weight gain as compared 
      to single housed colony (SHC) controls. In addition, CSC exposure increased 
      voluntary ethanol intake and ethanol-CPP. Interestingly, we found that EE 
      significantly and consistently reduced anxiety and ethanol consumption and 
      preference. However, neither tastants' (saccharin and quinine) intake nor blood 
      ethanol metabolism were affected by EE. Finally, and most importantly, EE reduced 
      the acquisition of CPP induced by 1.5g/kg ethanol. Taken together, these results 
      support the hypothesis that EE can reduce voluntary ethanol intake and 
      ethanol-induced conditioned reward and seems to be one of the strategies to 
      reduce the behavioral deficits and the risk of anxiety-induced alcohol abuse.

PG  - 4048-61
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhu119 [doi]
AB  - Environmental enrichment is a powerful way to stimulate brain and behavioral 
      plasticity. However the required exposure duration to reach such changes has not 
      been substantially analyzed. We aimed to assess the time-course of appearance of 
      the beneficial effects of enriched environment. Thus, different behavioral tests 
      and neurobiological parameters (such as neurogenesis, brain monoamines levels, 
      and stress-related hormones) were concomitantly realized after different 
      durations of enriched environment (24 h, 1, 3, or 5 weeks). While short 
      enrichment exposure (24 h) was sufficient to improve object recognition memory 
      performances, a 3-week exposure was required to improve aversive stimulus-based 
      memory performances and to reduce anxiety-like behavior; effects that were not 
      observed with longer duration. The onset of behavioral changes after a 3-week 
      exposure might be supported by higher serotonin levels in the frontal cortex, but 
      seems independent of neurogenesis phenomenon. Additionally, the benefit of 3-week 
      exposure on memory was not observed 3 weeks after cessation of enrichment. Thus, 
      the 3-week exposure appears as an optimal duration in order to induce the most 
      significant behavioral effects and to assess the underlying mechanisms. 
      Altogether, these results suggest that the duration of exposure is a keystone of 
      the beneficial behavioral and neurobiological effects of environmental 
      enrichment.

TI  - Early life influences on emotional reactivity: evidence that social enrichment 
      has greater effects than handling on anxiety-like behaviors, neuroendocrine 
      responses to stress and central BDNF levels.
PG  - 808-20
LID - 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.02.008 [doi]
AB  - During the early post-natal phases the brain is experience-seeking and provided 
      by a considerable plasticity which allows a fine tuning between the external 
      environment and the developing organism. Since the early work of Seymour Levine, 
      an impressive amount of research has clearly shown that stressful experiences 
      exert powerful effects on the brain and body development. These effects can last 
      throughout the entire life span influencing brain function and increasing the 
      risk for depression and anxiety disorders. The mechanisms underlying the effects 
      of early stress on the developing organism have been widely studied in rodents 
      through experimental manipulations of the post-natal environment, such as 
      handling, which have been shown to exert important effects on the emotional 
      phenotype and the response to stress. In the present paper we review the relevant 
      literature and present some original data indicating that, compared to handling, 
      which imposes an external manipulation on the mother-infant relationship, social 
      enrichment, in the form of communal rearing, in mice has very profound effects on 
      animal's emotionality and the response to stress. These effects are also 
      accompanied by important changes in central levels of brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor. The present data indicate that communal rearing has more pervasive 
      effects than handling, strengthening previous data suggesting that it is a good 
      animal model of reduced susceptibility to depression-like behavior. Overall, the 
      availability of ever more sophisticated animal models represents a fundamental 
      tool to translate basic research data into appropriate interventions for humans 
      raised under traumatic or impoverished situations.

TI  - Environmental enrichment and pain sensitivity; a study in maternally separated 
      rats.
LID - 10.1002/jdn.10031 [doi]
AB  - Rodents are highly dependent on maternal care after birth. Maternal separation 
      (MS) is an animal model for studying neglect and abuse. Depriving the pup of such 
      care renders the animal with Hypothalamic-Pituitary-adrenal (HPA) dysfunction and 
      these animals are more susceptible to anxiety and stress as well as poor 
      cognition. These effects are due to abnormal brain development in these animals. 
      We have tried to investigate how maternal separation can affect pain sensation 
      and whether a non-pharmacological intervention such as enriched environment (EE) 
      can restore an abnormal pain sensation. Animals were put into four groups MS, 
      control (CTRL) and MS + EE and CTRL + EE groups that underwent EE after weaning 
      until adulthood. These groups were tested for pain sensitivity with hot plate and 
      tail flick for sensory pain and formalin for affect pain. The results showed that 
      MS rats are more sensitive to pain in the hot plate test and formalin test, 
      however, no significant difference was seen between groups for tail flick test. 
      When MS rats experience EE their pain sensitivity is restored at the behavioral 
      level. Further research is required to see how EE restores pain sensation in MS 
      rats.

TI  - Altered gene expression and PTSD symptom dimensions in World Trade Center 
      responders.
PG  - 2225-2246

AB  - Despite experiencing a significant trauma, only a subset of World Trade Center 
      (WTC) rescue and recovery workers developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
      Identification of biomarkers is critical to the development of targeted 
      interventions for treating disaster responders and potentially preventing the 
      development of PTSD in this population. Analysis of gene expression from these 
      individuals can help in identifying biomarkers of PTSD. We established a 
      well-phenotyped sample of 371 WTC responders, recruited from a longitudinal WTC 
      responder cohort using stratified random sampling, by obtaining blood, 
      self-reported and clinical interview data. Using bulk RNA-sequencing from whole 
      blood, we examined the association between gene expression and WTC-related PTSD 
      symptom severity on (i) highest lifetime Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) 
      score, (ii) past-month CAPS score, and (iii) PTSD symptom dimensions using a 
      5-factor model of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, dysphoric 
      arousal and anxious arousal symptoms. We corrected for sex, age, genotype-derived 
      principal components and surrogate variables. Finally, we performed a 
      meta-analysis with existing PTSD studies (total N = 1016), using case/control 
      status as the predictor and correcting for these variables. We identified 66 
      genes significantly associated with total highest lifetime CAPS score 
      (FDR-corrected p < 0.05), and 31 genes associated with total past-month CAPS 
      score. Our more granular analyses of PTSD symptom dimensions identified 
      additional genes that did not reach statistical significance in our analyses with 
      total CAPS scores. In particular, we identified 82 genes significantly associated 
      with lifetime anxious arousal symptoms. Several genes significantly associated 
      with multiple PTSD symptom dimensions and total lifetime CAPS score (SERPINA1, 
      RPS6KA1, and STAT3) have been previously associated with PTSD. Geneset enrichment 
      of these findings has identified pathways significant in metabolism, immune 
      signaling, other psychiatric disorders, neurological signaling, and cellular 
      structure. Our meta-analysis revealed 10 genes that reached genome-wide 
      significance, all of which were downregulated in cases compared to controls 
      (CIRBP, TMSB10, FCGRT, CLIC1, RPS6KB2, HNRNPUL1, ALDOA, NACA, ZNF429 and COPE). 
      Additionally, cellular deconvolution highlighted an enrichment in CD4 T cells and 
      eosinophils in responders with PTSD compared to controls. The distinction in 
      significant genes between total lifetime CAPS score and the anxious arousal 
      symptom dimension of PTSD highlights a potential biological difference in the 
      mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of the PTSD phenotype. Future studies 
      should be clear about methods used to analyze PTSD status, as phenotypes based on 
      PTSD symptom dimensions may yield different gene sets than combined CAPS score 
      analysis. Potential biomarkers implicated from our meta-analysis may help improve 
      therapeutic target development for PTSD.

TI  - Lead pulling as a welfare concern in pet dogs: What can veterinary professionals 
      learn from current research?
PG  - e1627
LID - 10.1002/vetr.1627 [doi]
AB  - Veterinary professionals (VPs) are often the first source of advice for clients 
      struggling with their dog's behaviour, and pulling on the lead is a commonplace 
      undesirable behaviour VPs will encounter regularly in practice. Excluding bites, 
      being pulled over while walking on a lead is the leading cause of non-fatal 
      dog-related injuries in the UK. This narrative review investigates lead pulling 
      as a welfare concern in pet dogs, highlighting aspects of the literature of 
      particular interest to VPs. Lead pulling could negatively affect walk quality, 
      frequency and duration, causing weight gain, while decreased environmental 
      enrichment could trigger other undesirable behaviours. Aversive equipment to 
      prevent lead pulling can cause pain, distress and injury, but even equipment 
      considered humane can have welfare consequences. Punitive training methods could 
      cause dogs stress, fear and anxiety and trigger aggressive behaviour. While these 
      lead pulling outcomes are welfare concerns in themselves, they could also weaken 
      dog-owner attachment, a risk factor in pet dog relinquishment. Given lead pulling 
      could affect the welfare of patients in a VPs care, clinical implications and 
      opportunities for client education are outlined. Educating clients on humane 
      prevention and modification of lead pulling could make walks easier, safer and 
      more enjoyable, with positive outcomes for clients, canine welfare and the 
      practice.

TI  - Behavioral effects of environmental enrichment on male and female wistar rats 
      with early life stress experiences.
PG  - 837661
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.837661 [doi]
LID - 837661
AB  - Exposure to adverse childhood experiences or early life stress experiences (ELSs) 
      increase the risk of non-adaptive behaviors and psychopathology in adulthood. 
      Environmental enrichment (EE) has been proposed to minimize these effects. The 
      vast number of methodological variations in animal studies underscores the lack 
      of systematicity in the studies and the need for a detailed understanding of how 
      enrichment interacts with other variables. Here we evaluate the effects of 
      environmental enrichment in male and female Wistar rats exposed to adverse early 
      life experiences (prenatal, postnatal, and combined) on emotional (elevated plus 
      maze), social (social interaction chamber), memory (Morris water maze) and 
      flexibility tasks. Our results-collected from PND 51 to 64-confirmed: 1) the 
      positive effect of environmental enrichment (PND 28-49) on anxiety-like behaviors 
      in animals submitted to ELSs. These effects depended on type of experience and 
      type of enrichment: foraging enrichment reduced anxiety-like behaviors in animals 
      with prenatal and postnatal stress but increased them in animals without ELSs. 
      This effect was sex-dependent: females showed lower anxiety compared to males. 
      Our data also indicated that females exposed to prenatal and postnatal stress had 
      lower anxious responses than males in the same conditions; 2) no differences were 
      found for social interactions; 3) concerning memory, there was a significant 
      interaction between the three factors: A significant interaction for males with 
      prenatal stress was observed for foraging enrichment, while physical enrichment 
      was positive for males with postnatal stress; d) regarding cognitive flexibility, 
      a positive effect of EE was found in animals exposed to adverse ELSs: animals 
      with combined stress and exposed to physical enrichment showed a higher index of 
      cognitive flexibility than those not exposed to enrichment. Yet, within animals 
      with no EE, those exposed to combined stress showed lower flexibility than those 
      exposed to both prenatal stress and no stress. On the other hand, animals with 
      prenatal stress and exposed to foraging-type enrichment showed lower cognitive 
      flexibility than those with no EE. The prenatal stress-inducing conditions used 
      here 5) did not induced fetal or maternal problems and 6) did not induced changes 
      in the volume of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

TI  - Environmental Enrichment Protects Against Cognition Deficits Caused by 
      Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most serious complications of sepsis is sepsis-associated 
      encephalopathy (SAE), which impairs the cognition ability of survivors. 
      Environmental enrichment (EE) has been demonstrated to alleviate cognition 
      deficits under many kinds of brain injury conditions. However, EE's effects on 
      SAE remain unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine EE's effect on 
      cognition disorders under SAE conditions and the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Adult male rats, subject to SAE or not, were housed under a standard 
      environment (SE) or EE for 30 days. Subsequently, the rats were subjected to 
      cognitive tests, such as the novel object recognition (NOR) test, the Morris 
      water maze (MWM) test, an Open Field (OF) test, the elevated plus maze (EPM) 
      test, and a sensory neglect (SN) test. Neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and 
      oxidative stress changes in the brain were also detected. RESULTS: The results 
      revealed that SAE impaired somatesthesia, recognition memory, spatial learning 
      and memory, and exploratory activity, which were significantly improved by EE 
      housing. EE also prevented SAE-induced anxiety-like behavior. In addition, EE 
      housing capable induced a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increase 
      in anti-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant properties in the brain. Moreover, 
      EE housing exerted an anti-apoptosis function by upregulating the level of B-cell 
      lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) level and downregulating the level of p53 level in 
      the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicated that EE 
      exerts a neuroprotective function on cognitive ability in SAE rats. The effect is 
      achieved by increasing antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic 
      capacities. EE can effectively rescue SAE-induced cognitive deficits.

AB  - Mental illness is the leading cause of disability worldwide. We are only just 
      beginning to reveal and comprehend the complex interaction that exists between 
      the genetic makeup of an organism and the potential modifying effect of the 
      environment in which it lives, and how this translates into mediating 
      susceptibility to neurological and psychiatric conditions. The capacity to 
      address this issue experimentally has been facilitated by the availability of 
      rodent models which allow the precise manipulation of genetic and environmental 
      factors. In this review, we discuss the valuable nature of animal models in 
      furthering our understanding of the relationship between genetic and 
      environmental factors in affective illnesses, such as anxiety and depressive 
      disorders. We first highlight the behavioral impairments exhibited by genetically 
      targeted animal models of affective disorders, and then provide a discussion of 
      the underlying neurobiology, focusing on animal models that involve exposure to 
      stress. This is followed by a review of recent studies that report of beneficial 
      effects of environmental manipulations such as environmental enrichment and 
      enhanced physical activity and discuss the likely mechanisms that mediate those 
      benefits.

TI  - Effects of work-to-family enrichment on psychological distress and family 
      satisfaction: A dyadic analysis in dual-earner parents.
PG  - 634-647
LID - 10.1111/sjop.12850 [doi]
AB  - Resources that individuals acquire at work can have significant effects on their 
      own well-being and family satisfaction, and on those of their closest family 
      relations. Following the conservation of resources theory, this study examined 
      the effects of work-to-family enrichment (WFE) on psychological distress 
      (depression, anxiety, and stress) and family satisfaction (SWFaL) in 
      different-gender dual-earner parents. The sample consisted of 473 couples - 
      mother and father - from Temuco, Chile, who answered the Work-Family Interface 
      scale, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Satisfaction with Family 
      Scale. The analysis was conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model 
      (APIM). Results showed that WFE was positively associated with SWFaL for both 
      mothers and fathers (actor effects), whereas higher WFE was linked to lower 
      psychological distress only in fathers. For mothers and fathers, psychological 
      distress was negatively associated with their own (actor effects) and the other 
      parent's SWFAL (partner effects). The mediating role of psychological distress 
      was found only for fathers' WFE and their SWFaL. These results indicate that 
      resources from work can increase family satisfaction for both fathers and mothers 
      in dual-earner couples with adolescent children. However, in these couples, 
      fathers acquire affective resources (positive mood) that reduce their own 
      psychological distress, while mothers acquire skills (managing time at home more 
      efficiently) that they invest directly in the family domain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune dysregulation has been widely observed in those with 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). An individual's immune response is shaped, 
      in part, by the highly polymorphic Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) locus that is 
      associated with major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major 
      depression and bipolar disorder. The aim of the current study was to investigate 
      the association between common HLA alleles and PTSD. METHODS: Genome-wide 
      association data was used to predict alleles of 7 classical polymorphic HLA genes 
      (A, B, C, DRB1, DQA1, DQB1, DPB1) in 403 lifetime PTSD cases and 369 trauma 
      exposed controls of African ancestry. Association of HLA allelic variations with 
      lifetime PTSD was analyzed using logistic regression, controlling for ancestry, 
      sex and multiple comparisons. The effect of HLA alleles on gene expression was 
      assessed by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), using 353 subjects 
      with available expression data. Enrichment analysis was performed using 
      anRichment to identify associated pathways of each module. RESULTS: HLA-B*58:01 
      (p = 0.035), HLA-C*07:01 (p = 0.035), HLA-DQA1*01:01 (p = 0.003), HLA-DQB1*05:01 
      (p = 0.009) and HLA-DPB1*17:01 (p = 0.017) were more common in PTSD cases, while 
      HLA-A*02:01 (p = 0.026), HLA-DQA1*05:05 (p = 0.011) and HLA-DRB1*11:01 
      (p < 0.001) were more frequent in controls. WGCNA was used to explore expression 
      patterns of the PTSD related alleles. Gene expression modules of PTSD-related HLA 
      alleles were enriched in various pathways, including pathways related to immune 
      and neural activity. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
      study to report an association of HLA alleles with PTSD. Altogether, our results 
      support the link between the immune system, brain and PTSD.

AB  - Gene expression has provided promising insights into the pathophysiology of 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, specific regulatory 
      transcriptomic mechanisms remain unknown. The present study addressed this 
      limitation by performing transcriptome-wide RNA-Seq of whole-blood samples from 
      226 World Trade Center responders. The investigation focused on differential 
      expression (DE) at the gene, isoform, and for the first time, alternative 
      splicing (AS) levels associated with the symptoms of PTSD: total burden, 
      re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal subdimensions. These 
      symptoms were associated with 76, 1, 48, 15, and 49 DE genes, respectively 
      (FDR < 0.05). Moreover, they were associated with 103, 11, 0, 43, and 32 AS 
      events. Avoidance differed the most from other dimensions with respect to DE 
      genes and AS events. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified pathways 
      involved in inflammatory and metabolic processes, which may have implications in 
      the treatment of PTSD. Overall, the findings shed a novel light on the wide range 
      of transcriptomic alterations associated with PTSD at the gene and AS levels. The 
      results of DE analysis associated with PTSD subdimensions highlights the 
      importance of studying PTSD symptom heterogeneity.

AB  - Asthma, an inflammatory disorder of the airways, is one of the most common 
      chronic illnesses worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity. There 
      is growing recognition of an association between asthma and mood disorders 
      including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder 
      (MDD). Although there are several hypotheses regarding the relationship between 
      asthma and mental health, there is little understanding of underlying mechanisms 
      and causality. In the current study we utilized publicly available datasets of 
      human blood mRNA collected from patients with severe and moderate asthma, MDD, 
      and PTSD. We performed differential expression (DE) analysis and Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on diseased subjects against the healthy subjects from 
      their respective datasets, compared the results between diseases, and validated 
      DE genes and gene sets with 4 more independent datasets. Our analysis revealed 
      that commonalities in blood transcriptomic changes were only found between the 
      severe form of asthma and mood disorders. Gene expression commonly regulated in 
      PTSD and severe asthma, included ORMDL3 a gene known to be associated with asthma 
      risk and STX8, which is involved in TrkA signaling. We also identified several 
      pathways commonly regulated to both MDD and severe asthma. This study reveals 
      gene and pathway regulation that potentially drives the comorbidity between 
      severe asthma, PTSD, and MDD and may serve as foci for future research aimed at 
      gaining a better understanding of both the relationship between asthma and PTSD, 
      and the pathophysiology of the individual disorders.

AB  - Although it has been long believed that new neurons were only generated during 
      development, there is now growing evidence indicating that at least two regions 
      in the brain are capable of continuously generating functional neurons: the 
      subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Adult hippocampal 
      neurogenesis (AHN) is a widely observed phenomenon verified in different adult 
      mammalian species including humans. Factors such as environmental enrichment, 
      voluntary exercise, and diet have been linked to increased levels of AHN. 
      Conversely, aging, stress, anxiety and depression have been suggested to hinder 
      it. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still unclear and yet to 
      be determined. In this paper, we discuss some recent findings addressing the 
      effects of different dietary polyphenols on hippocampal cell proliferation and 
      differentiation, models of anxiety, and depression as well as some proposed 
      molecular mechanisms underlying those effects with particular focus on those 
      related to AHN. As a whole, dietary polyphenols seem to exert positive effects on 
      anxiety and depression, possibly in part via regulation of AHN. Studies on the 
      effects of dietary polyphenols on behaviour and AHN may play an important role in 
      the approach to use diet as part of the therapeutic interventions for 
      mental-health-related conditions.

AB  - The manner in which laboratory rodents are housed is driven by economics (minimal 
      use of space and resources), ergonomics (ease of handling and visibility of 
      animals), hygiene, and standardization (reduction of variation). This has 
      resulted in housing conditions that lack sensory and motor stimulation and 
      restrict the expression of species-typical behavior. In mice, such housing 
      conditions have been associated with indicators of impaired welfare, including 
      abnormal repetitive behavior (stereotypies, compulsive behavior), enhanced 
      anxiety and stress reactivity, and thermal stress. However, due to concerns that 
      more complex environmental conditions might increase variation in experimental 
      results, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of 
      environmental enrichment beyond the provision of nesting material. Here, using 96 
      C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied 
      environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common 
      enrichment strategies: (1) bedding alone; (2) bedding + nesting material; (3) 
      deeper bedding + nesting material + shelter + increased vertical space; and (4) 
      semi-naturalistic conditions, including weekly changes of enrichment items. We 
      studied how these different forms of environmental enrichment affected measures 
      of animal welfare, including home-cage behavior (time-budget and stereotypic 
      behavior), anxiety (open field behavior, elevated plus-maze behavior), growth 
      (food and water intake, body mass), stress physiology (glucocorticoid metabolites 
      in fecal boluses and adrenal mass), brain function (recurrent perseveration in a 
      two-choice guessing task) and emotional valence (judgment bias). Our results 
      highlight the difficulty in making general recommendations across common strains 
      of mice and for selecting enrichment strategies within specific strains. Overall, 
      the greatest benefit was observed in animals housed with the greatest degree of 
      enrichment. Thus, in the super-enriched housing condition, stereotypic behavior, 
      behavioral measures of anxiety, growth and stress physiology varied in a manner 
      consistent with improved animal welfare compared to the other housing conditions 
      with less enrichment. Similar to other studies, we found no evidence, in the 
      measures assessed here, that environmental enrichment increased variation in 
      experimental results.

AB  - The relatively high rates of mental stress among critically ill patients and 
      their relatives implies the necessity of conceptually and financially embedded 
      psychological care in intensive care units (ICUs). Professional associations also 
      recommend the involvement of psychological professionals and screening of mental 
      symptoms in critically ill patients. Intensive care medicine psychologists and 
      psychotherapists take this as an opportunity to describe the content and goals of 
      psychological care. Task areas are care for patients and relatives as well as 
      staff support. Goals of psychological support in the ICU are detection of mental 
      symptoms in patients and their treatment, psychological first aid for relatives 
      in crisis situations, and support of the staff in terms of communication with 
      patients and relatives as well as regarding development and maintenance of an 
      adaptive coping style for dealing with emotionally challenging situations. 
      Psychological care in the ICU is offered by psychologists, psychotherapists, or 
      physicians with a psychotherapeutic qualification. The psychologist is integrated 
      into the ICU team and has a proactive, resource-oriented, and supportive 
      orientation. Psychological support can be an enrichment and a relief, both in the 
      interdisciplinary treatment of patients as well as in the care of relatives, and 
      also represent a resource for the team.

TI  - Transgenerational effects of infantile adversity and enrichment in male and 
      female rats.
PG  - 169-86
LID - 10.1002/dev.20592 [doi]
AB  - To discover whether the accumulation of life's experiences, adverse and 
      enriching, inform, and serve the following generation by inheritance we examine 
      whether stress to a weanling female will influence her future offspring, whether 
      prereproductive enrichment to the dam, or postweaning enrichment to the 
      offspring, can reverse the transgenerational effects of stress, and whether, like 
      adversity, enrichment might have transgenerational effects. Female rats were 
      exposed to stressors when they were 27-29 days old. Half of these females and 
      their controls were then raised in an enriched environment from weaning until 
      mating at 60 days to examine whether preproduction enrichment reverses the 
      effects of preproduction stress on offspring. Half of the offspring of each group 
      were raised in an enriched environment after weaning, to see whether it reverses 
      the effects of preproduction stress and buttresses prereproductive enrichment. 
      Behavior was examined in 625 adult offspring in 16 groups covering all 
      permutations of the experimental variables (preproduction weanling stress (PS), 
      preproduction enrichment (PE), offspring enrichment (OE), sex). Exploration, 
      avoidance learning, startle, and social interaction were tested. Results reveal 
      that very early prereproductive experience in females, adverse or enriching, will 
      transgenerationally influence their future offspring, depending on the behavior 
      tested and sex. Our finding that enrichment, whether to the parent or offspring 
      generation, can ameliorate the transgenerational impact of adversity, has novel 
      implications for the malleability of transgenerational inheritance, and its 
      individual, social, and therapeutic impact.

AB  - Stress vulnerability could influence the treatment response to anxiety associated 
      with abrupt hormonal suppression. The present study explored the effects of 
      different treatments on experimental anxiety induced by progesterone withdrawal 
      (PW) in a stress-sensitive rat strain, Wistar Kyoto (WKY), in the burying 
      behavior test (BBT). The following experimental series was conducted using 
      independent groups of Wistar (control strain) and WKY ovariectomized rats: 
      Experiment 1: Rats were treated for 5days with oil, a constant dose of 
      progesterone (0.5mg/rat, s.c) or a combination of progesterone (0.5mg/rat, s.c) 
      plus fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p); on day 6, all rats were subjected to BBT. 
      Experiment 2: Rats received corn oil or decreasing doses of progesterone (0.84, 
      0.67, 0.5, 0.33 and 0.17mg/rat; one dose daily); on day 6, the rats were 
      subjected to BBT. Experiment 3: Rats were divided into two groups that were 
      subjected to 30days of standard conditions or environmental enrichment (EE); from 
      days 25 to 30, all rats received a fixed dose of progesterone (0.5mg/rat, s.c.) 
      or vehicle. On day 31, the rats were tested with BBT. Results showed that PW 
      increased anxiety in both strains, and fluoxetine prevented anxiety in WKY rats. 
      In contrast, a gradual reduction of progesterone prevents the anxiety in Wistar 
      but not in WKY. EE was preventive against the anxiety induced by PW in both 
      strains of rats. Thus, the results suggest that anxiety induced by PW is 
      prevented by EE while the anxiolytic effect of pharmacological treatments depends 
      on stress vulnerability.

AB  - Chronic stress drives behavioral and physiological changes associated with 
      numerous psychiatric disease states. In rodents, the vast majority of chronic 
      stress models involve imposition of external stressors, whereas in humans stress 
      is often driven by internal cues, commonly associated with a sense of loss. We 
      previously exposed groups of rats to environmental enrichment (EE) for a 
      protracted period (1 month), followed by removal of enrichment (ER), to induce an 
      experience of loss in male rats. ER enhanced immobility in the forced swim test 
      (FST), led to hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis hypoactivity, and caused 
      hyperphagia relative to continuously enriched (EE), single-housed (Scon) and 
      pair-housed (Pcon) groups, most of which were reversible by antidepressant 
      treatment (Smith et al., 2017). Here, we have applied the same approach to study 
      enrichment loss in female rats. Similar to the males, enrichment removal in 
      females led to an increase in the time spent immobile in the FST and increased 
      daytime food intake compared to the single and pair-housed controls. Unlike 
      males, ER females showed decreased sucrose preference, and showed estrus 
      cycle-dependent HPA axis hyperactivity to an acute restraint stress. The increase 
      in passive coping (immobility), anhedonia-like behavior in the sucrose preference 
      test and HPA axis dysregulation suggest that enrichment removal produces a loss 
      phenotype in females that differs from that seen in males, which may be more 
      pronounced in nature.

AB  - As a validation step of an animal simulation, the effects of environmental 
      enrichment were tested in the anxiety-depression model, in which socially raised 
      chicks are placed in isolation for a 2h test period. Isolated chicks display an 
      initial high rate of distress vocalizations, constituting the anxiety-like phase, 
      followed by a marked decline and plateau in rates of vocalizations for the 
      remainder of time in isolation, characterizing the depression-like phase. Four 
      separate groups of domestic fowl chicks were group housed under enriched, 
      impoverished (i.e., non-enriched) or a combination of the two housing conditions 
      for six days and tested at 7d posthatch in the aforementioned isolation 
      procedure. Rates of distress vocalizations in the anxiety-like (2-3 min) or 
      depression-like (30-120 min) phases were not affected by housing conditions. 
      However, chicks continuously housed in enriched environments and chicks housed in 
      the enriched environments on days 4-6 displayed a delay in the onset of the 
      depression-like phase. The beneficial effect of environmental enrichment on the 
      depression-like phase is consistent with other stress paradigms and provides 
      another step towards validating the chick anxiety-depression model as a clinical 
      simulation.

TI  - Nature and nurture: environmental influences on a genetic rat model of 
      depression.
PG  - e770
LID - 10.1038/tp.2016.28 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we sought to learn whether adverse events such as chronic 
      restraint stress (CRS), or 'nurture' in the form of environmental enrichment 
      (EE), could modify depression-like behavior and blood biomarker transcript levels 
      in a genetic rat model of depression. The Wistar Kyoto More Immobile (WMI) is a 
      genetic model of depression that aided in the identification of blood 
      transcriptomic markers, which successfully distinguished adolescent and adult 
      subjects with major depressive disorders from their matched no-disorder controls. 
      Here, we followed the effects of CRS and EE in adult male WMIs and their 
      genetically similar control strain, the Wistar Kyoto Less Immobile (WLI), that 
      does not show depression-like behavior, by measuring the levels of these 
      transcripts in the blood and hippocampus. In WLIs, increased depression-like 
      behavior and transcriptomic changes were present in response to CRS, but in WMIs 
      no behavioral or additive transcriptomic changes occurred. Environmental 
      enrichment decreased both the inherent depression-like behavior in the WMIs and 
      the behavioral difference between WMIs and WLIs, but did not reverse basal 
      transcript level differences between the strains. The inverse behavioral change 
      induced by CRS and EE in the WLIs did not result in parallel inverse expression 
      changes of the transcriptomic markers, suggesting that these behavioral responses 
      to the environment work via separate molecular pathways. In contrast, 'trait' 
      transcriptomic markers with expression differences inherent and unchanging 
      between the strains regardless of the environment suggest that in our model, 
      environmental and genetic etiologies of depression work through independent 
      molecular mechanisms.

TI  - Neonatal handling and environmental enrichment effects on emotionality, 
      novelty/reward seeking, and age-related cognitive and hippocampal impairments: 
      focus on the Roman rat lines.
PG  - 513-26
AB  - Roman high- and low-avoidance (RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh) rats are selected and bred 
      for extreme divergence in two-way active avoidance acquisition. In addition, 
      compared to RLA/Verh rats, RHA/Verh rats are (behaviorally and physiologically) 
      less anxious or reactive to stressors, show increased novelty (sensation)-seeking 
      behavior as well as a higher preference for rewarding substances, and are usually 
      less efficient in learning tasks not involving shock administration. The present 
      article reviews evidence showing that neonatal handling and/or environmental 
      enrichment leads to enduring effects (their magnitude frequently depending upon 
      the rat line) on those behaviors. For example, it has been found that neonatal 
      handling reduces most of the (behavioral and physiological) signs of 
      emotionality/anxiety in RLA/Verh rats, while environmental enrichment increases 
      their novelty seeking (also the case with RHA/Verh rats), saccharin and ethanol 
      intake, and sensitivity to amphetamine. Finally, initial results (currently being 
      further elaborated upon) support a preventive action of both environmental 
      treatments on age-related impairments in learning a spatial, water maze task as 
      well as on hippocampal neuronal atrophy.

TI  - Genomic modules and intramodular network concordance in susceptible and resilient 
      male mice across models of stress.

AB  - The multifactorial etiology of stress-related disorders necessitates a constant 
      interrogation of the molecular convergences in preclinical models of stress that 
      use disparate paradigms as stressors spanning from environmental challenges to 
      genetic predisposition to hormonal signaling. Using RNA-sequencing, we 
      investigated the genomic signatures in the ventral hippocampus common to mouse 
      models of stress. Chronic oral corticosterone (CORT) induced increased anxiety- 
      and depression-like behavior in wild-type male mice and male mice heterozygous 
      for the gene coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met, a variant 
      associated with genetic susceptibility to stress. In a separate set of male mice, 
      chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) led to a susceptible or a resilient 
      population, whose proportion was dependent on housing conditions, namely standard 
      housing or enriched environment. Rank-rank-hypergeometric overlap (RRHO), a 
      threshold-free approach that ranks genes by their p value and effect size 
      direction, was used to identify genes from a continuous gradient of significancy 
      that were concordant across groups. In mice treated with CORT and in 
      standard-housed susceptible mice, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
      concordant for gene networks involved in neurotransmission, cytoskeleton 
      function, and vascularization. Weighted gene co-expression analysis generated 54 
      gene hub modules and revealed two modules in which both CORT and CSDS-induced 
      enrichment in DEGs, whose function was concordant with the RRHO predictions, and 
      correlated with behavioral resilience or susceptibility. These data showed 
      transcriptional concordance across models in which the stress coping depends upon 
      hormonal, environmental, or genetic factors revealing common genomic drivers that 
      embody the multifaceted nature of stress-related disorders.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the influence of short-term 
      (2-week) exposure to social (SE) and/or physical enrichment (PE) on the 
      anxiety-like behavior of ovariectomized (OVX) NIH Swiss mice. Method : One week 
      after surgery, each OVX mouse was housed under one of 4 social conditions: (1) 
      isolated, (2) accompanied by an intact female, (3) accompanied by an intact male, 
      or (4) in a community of 10 OVX individuals. The animals in each of these 
      environments were divided into 2 subgroups, consisting of the presence and 
      absence of PE. Following a 2-week exposure to the respective conditions, each OVX 
      mouse was subjected to either the light/dark exploration test (LDT) or the 
      elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine anxiety-like behavior. Results: The LDT and 
      EPM showed very similar patterns. Compared to an impoverished environment, PE 
      elicited a significant anxiolytic effect for OVX mice housed alone or in 
      companion of an intact female (F [1, 54] = 16.11, P = 0.001). By contrast, mice 
      living in community but without PE displayed anxiogenic-like behavior, perhaps 
      due to crowding, compared to the animals living in isolation (F [1, 36] = 5.64, P 
      = 0.023). Conclusion: This study emphasized the importance of taking housing 
      conditions into account during the screening of new anxiolytic agents and the 
      critical role of OVX in the regulation of anxiety.

TI  - The environmental enrichment ameliorates chronic unpredictable mild 
      stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline by inducing 
      autophagy-mediated inflammation inhibition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People exposed to prolonged chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) 
      are easy to suffer from depression and cognitive impairment. Environmental 
      enrichment (EE) had a beneficial effect on depressive-like and cognition-like 
      behaviors by inhibiting inflammation. However, the specific mechanism involved in 
      the inflammation inhibition that occurs after EE treatment for the depression and 
      cognitive decline induced by CUMS remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated 
      the possible mechanism of the beneficial effects on depression and cognition by 
      EE. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups as follows: (1) Control 
      + standard environment (SE), (2) CUMS + SE, (3) CUMS + EE, (4) CUMS 
      + EE+ 3-methiladenine (3-MA), (5) CUMS + SE + 3-MA. They were exposed to CUMS 
      procedure for 5 weeks except the control group. After CUMS procedure, rats were 
      housed in the EE or SE for 3 weeks. During EE or SE treatment, rats were injected 
      with normal saline or 3-MA every day. 3-MA as an autophagy inhibitor suppresses 
      autophagy via inhibition of class III PI3K. Behavioral tests were used to 
      investigate depressive-like and cognition-like behaviors after EE treatment. 
      Then, autophagy-related proteins, inflammation-related molecules, transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluoresence were determined. RESULTS: We 
      found that CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment, 
      reflected in worse behavioral test, such as reduced sucrose preference ratio, 
      decreased locomotor and exploratory activity, prolonged immobility and spatial 
      learning and memory impairment. In addition, CUMS rats exhibited the reduced 
      expression of autophagy related proteins including LC3 and Beclin-1 and the 
      increased inflammation activation including microglia cells, NLRP3 inflammasome 
      and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α). After EE treatment, these 
      changes were reversed. However, 3-MA, the inhibitor of autophagy, eliminated the 
      neuroprotective effects of EE on depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline. 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that EE can play neuroprotective effects on 
      depression and cognitive impairment by inducing autophagy-mediated inflammation 
      inhibition, which accounts for the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, 
      including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α.

      Mice.
PG  - 1857-1867

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in relationship between stress and diet. To 
      address this relationship, we evaluated an animal model of depression: male 
      C57BL/6J mice subjected to subchronic mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) for 10 
      consecutive days using male ICR mice under two different calorie-adjusted diets 
      conditions-nonpurified (MF) and semipurified (AIN) diets made from natural and 
      chemical ingredients mainly, respectively. Our previous study indicates that diet 
      quality and purity affect stress susceptibility in sCSDS mice. We therefore 
      hypothesized that there are some key peripheral metabolites to change 
      stress-susceptible behavior. GC-MS metabolomics of plasma, liver, and cecal 
      content were performed on four test groups: sCSDS + AIN diet (n = 7), sCSDS + MF 
      diet (n = 6), control (no sCSDS) + AIN diet (n = 8), and control + MF diet (n = 
      8). Metabolome analyses revealed that the number of metabolites changed by food 
      was larger than the number changed by stress in all tissues. Enrichment analysis 
      of the liver metabolite set altered by food implies that stress-susceptible mice 
      show increased glycolysis-related substrates in the liver. We found metabolites 
      that were affected by stress (e.g., plasma and liver 4-hydroxyproline and plasma 
      beta-alanine are higher in sCSDS than in control) and a stress × food interaction 
      (e.g., plasma GABA is lower in sCSDS + AIN than in sCSDS + MF). Because 
      functional compounds were altered by both stress and food, diet may be able to 
      attenuate various stress-induced symptoms by changing metabolites in peripheral 
      tissues.

      C57BL/6 Mice.

AB  - Elevated alcohol intake after abstinence is a key feature of the addiction 
      process. Some studies have shown that environmental enrichment (EE) affects 
      ethanol intake and other reinforcing effects. However, different EE protocols may 
      vary in their ability to influence alcohol consumption and stress-induced intake. 
      The present study evaluated whether short (3 h) or continuous (24 h) EE protocols 
      affect ethanol consumption after periods of withdrawal. Mice were challenged with 
      stressful stimuli (24 h isolation and restraint stress) to evaluate the effects 
      of stress on drinking. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a two-bottle choice 
      drinking-in-the-dark paradigm for 15 days (20% ethanol and water, 2 h/day, 
      acquisition phase). Control mice were housed under standard conditions (SC). In 
      the first experiment, one group of mice was housed under EE conditions 24 h/day 
      (EE24h). In the second experiment, the exposure to EE was reduced to 3 h/day 
      (EE3h). After the acquisition phase, the animals were deprived of ethanol for 6 
      days, followed by 2 h ethanol access once a week. Animals were tested in the 
      elevated plus maze (EPM) during ethanol withdrawal. During the last 2 weeks, the 
      mice were exposed to 24 h ethanol access. A 1-h restraint stress test was 
      performed immediately before the last ethanol exposure. EE24h but not EE3h 
      increased anxiety-like behavior during withdrawal compared to controls. Neither 
      EE24h nor EE3h affected ethanol consumption during the 2 h weekly exposure 
      periods. However, EE24h and EE3h mice that were exposed to acute restraint stress 
      consumed less ethanol than controls during a 24 h ethanol access. These results 
      showed that EE reduces alcohol intake after an acute restraint stress.

AB  - Animal models of fear and anxiety provide important insight into anxiety-related 
      symptoms in humans. Environmental physical conditions and social contact 
      influence behavior and brain plasticity particularly at early developmental 
      stages and have long lasting effects reaching even adulthood. The potential 
      benefit that a later environmental enrichment may have on rats raised in 
      isolation is however not fully understood. We aim to investigate the effects of 
      housing conditions and their reversion on anxiety and fear-related behaviors in 
      rats. In phase I, we compared the effects of different housing conditions 
      (environmental enrichment, control and social isolation) on anxiety behaviors in 
      the open field test, elevated plus maze and fear conditioning. We found stronger 
      effects of housing on behavioral tests when induced at weaning (phase I), than 
      later in development (phase II). After one month, EE rats showed lower anxiety 
      related behaviors and more freezing in FC. In phase II, we evaluated the effects 
      of the reversion of housing conditions on the same behavioral parameters. We 
      observed a behavioral trend such that the groups started to behave similar to 
      their new housing conditions in OFT mainly. These results suggest that housing 
      conditions at weaning can have long-lasting effects on anxiety and fear-related 
      behaviors. Because the behavioral changes observed after the housing reversal in 
      adulthood were partial, we suggest that more time of social and physical 
      enrichment could be necessary to promote major changes in behavior at this age.

      Against Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
PG  - 3297-3314
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S367871 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The mechanism of Wendan Decoction (WDD) against Generalized Anxiety 
      Disorder (GAD) was predicted by network pharmacology and validated by in vivo and 
      in vitro experiments. METHODS: The targets of WDD for the treatment of GAD were 
      obtained by a search of online databases. Further, PPI network and KEGG 
      enrichment were used to identify the key targets and pathways. Ultimately, these 
      key targets and pathways were validated by in vivo experiments on GAD mice 
      modeled by repeated restraint stress (RRS) and in vitro experiments on 
      inflammatory factor stimulated BV-2 cells. RESULTS: Through searching the 
      databases, the 137 ingredients of WDD that correspond to 938 targets and 4794 
      targets related to GAD were identified. Among them, 569 overlapping targets were 
      considered as the therapeutic targets of WDD for GAD. PPI analysis showed that 
      the inflammation-related proteins IL-6, TNF, SRC and AKT1 were the key targets, 
      and KEGG enrichment suggested that PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways were key 
      pathways of WDD in the treatment of GAD. In vivo experiments, RRS mice exhibited 
      abnormality in behavioristics in open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze 
      (EPM) and increases in serum corticosterone and the percentage of lymphocytes 
      positive for IL-6 in peripheral blood. These abnormal changes can be reversed by 
      WDD and the positive control drug paroxetine. In vitro experiments, WDD can 
      inhibit IL-6 induced activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways in BV2 
      cells, and suppress the ensuing release of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and 
      PGE(2), and showed a dose-dependent effect. CONCLUSION: WDD is able to resist GAD 
      by relieving inflammatory response in peripheral and central system.

TI  - The Effect of Environmental Enrichment on Laboratory Rare Minnows (Gobiocypris 
      rarus): Growth, Physiology, and Behavior.
LID - 10.3390/ani12040514 [doi]
LID - 514
AB  - Environmental enrichment is a method to increase environmental heterogeneity, 
      which may reduce stress and improve animal welfare. Previous studies have shown 
      that environmental enrichment can increase the growth rate, decrease aggressive 
      and anxiety-like behaviors, improve learning ability and agility, and reduce 
      cortisol levels in animals. These effects usually differ between species. 
      Unfortunately, habitat enrichment on laboratory fish is poorly studied and seldom 
      adopted in care guidance. Rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) have been cultured as 
      a native laboratory fish in China in barren banks without environmental 
      enrichment since 1990; they have been widely used in studies on ecotoxicology, 
      environmental science, and other topics. The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the effect of environment enrichment on the growth, physiological 
      status, and anxiety-like behavior of laboratory rare minnows. We observed and 
      analyzed SGR, cortisol levels, DA, DOPAC, 5-HT and 5-HIAA, and anxiety-like 
      behavior indexes after one month of treatment in barren (control) and enrichment 
      tanks. We found that there were no significant differences in SGR, anxiety-like 
      behavior, DA, DOPAC, or 5-HIAA levels between the two treatments. However, higher 
      cortisol and 5-HT levels were observed in the enrichment tanks. This study 
      suggests that rare minnows might be influenced by their living environment, and 
      future related studies should consider their environmental enrichment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has shown the important role of exosomes in the 
      maintenance of brain function and pathogenesis of brain disease, but little is 
      known about their association with depression. The aim of this project was to 
      explore the miRNA profile of exosomes in the serum of rats with depression 
      induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). METHODS: A rat model of 
      depression was replicated via CUMS. Behavioral performance was observed, and 
      serum exosomes were isolated and identified. The protein expression levels of 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), TrkB, and synaptotagmin 1 in the 
      hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and serum exosomes were measured. GO and 
      KEGG enrichment analysis of differential genes was carried out using the R 
      package clusterProfiler. RESULTS: The CUMS rats showed depression-like behaviors, 
      together with decreased expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, and synaptotagmin 1 in 
      the hippocampus, PFC, and serum exosomes. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis 
      indicated that the differential expression of miRNAs might play an important role 
      in the pathogenesis of stress-induced depression through the MAPK pathway, Wnt 
      pathway, and mTOR pathway. LIMITATIONS: The protein expression levels of BDNF, 
      TrkB, and synaptotagmin 1 were measured only in the hippocampus and PFC. The 
      function of the differentially expressed miRNAs was not verified in the animal 
      model, which should be investigated in detail in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      miRNA profile was altered in rats with stress-induced depression, which might be 
      considered a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of depression.

AB  - Convincing evidence shows that stress is associated with the development and 
      course of psychiatric and metabolic disorders. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis mediates the stress response, a cascade of events that culminate in 
      the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. Chronic hypercortisolism 
      typically characterizes stress-related illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, 
      and metabolic syndrome. Considering previous studies pointing that environmental 
      enrichment (EE) mitigates the deleterious effects of stress on neurobiological 
      systems, we hypothesized that EE can confer resiliency against prolonged 
      glucocorticoid administration-induced behavioral and metabolic alterations in 
      mice. In this regard, three-month-old male Swiss mice were exposed to a four-week 
      period of standard environment (SE) or EE. After this period, still in the 
      respective environments, dexamethasone was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 
      at a dose of 4 mg/kg, for 21 consecutive days, in order to generate the 
      emotional-related behavioral outcomes, as previously described. It is 
      demonstrated herein that EE prevents the dexamethasone-induced anxiety-like and 
      passive stress-coping behaviors, as observed in the open field and tail 
      suspension tests. Moreover, EE mitigated the hyperproteinemia and body weight 
      loss induced by excess dexamethasone and decreased basal glucose levels. Taken 
      together, these results support the hypothesis that EE attenuates the effects of 
      chronic administration of synthetic glucocorticoids in mice, a strategy that may 
      be translated to the clinical perspective.

TI  - Adverse Childhood Experiences Predict the Phenome of Affective Disorders and 
      These Effects Are Mediated by Staging, Neuroimmunotoxic and Growth Factor 
      Profiles.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) enhance pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant 
      responses. In affective disorders, recent precision nomothetic psychiatry studies 
      disclosed new pathway phenotypes, including an ROI-reoccurrence of illness 
      (ROI)-oxidative stress latent construct. The aim of the present study is to 
      delineate a) whether ACEs sensitize the M1 macrophage, the T helper cells (Th)1, 
      Th2, and Th17, the IRS (immune-inflammatory-responses system), the CIRS 
      (compensatory immunoregulatory system), and the neuroimmunotoxic and growth 
      factor (GF) profiles and whether they are associated with ROI and the phenome of 
      affective disorders and b) the molecular pathways underpinning the effects of the 
      ACEs. We collected supernatants of stimulated (5 μg/mL of PHA and 25 μg/mL of 
      LPS) and unstimulated diluted whole blood in 20 healthy controls and 30 depressed 
      patients and measured a panel of 27 cytokines/GF using a Luminex method. ACEs 
      (comprising mental and physical trauma, mental neglect, domestic violence, family 
      history of mental disease, and parent loss) are accompanied by the increased 
      stimulated, but not unstimulated, production of M1, Th1, Th2, Th17, IRS, 
      neuroimmunotoxic, and GF profiles and are strongly correlated with ROI and the 
      phenome. A latent vector extracted from the ROI features (recurrent episodes and 
      suicidal behaviors) and the IRS/neuroimmunotoxic/GF profiles explains 66.8% of 
      the variance in the phenome and completely mediates the effects of ACEs on the 
      phenome. Enrichment analysis showed that the ACE-associated sensitization of 
      immune/GF profiles involves JAK-STAT, nuclear factor-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α, 
      G-protein coupled receptor, PI3K/Akt/RAS/MAPK, and hypoxia signaling. In summary, 
      the ACE-induced sensitization of immune pathways and secondary immune hits 
      predicts the phenome of affective disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by a lesion in the developing infant 
      brain. Recent neuroplasticity literature suggests that intensive, task-specific 
      intervention ought to commence early, during the critical period of neural 
      development. AIMS: To determine whether "GAME" (Goals - Activity - Motor 
      Enrichment), a motor learning, environmental enrichment intervention, is 
      effective for improving motor skills in infants at high risk of CP. METHODS AND 
      PROCEDURES: Single blind randomised controlled trial of GAME versus standard 
      care. Primary outcome was motor skills on the Peabody Developmental Motor 
      Scales-2 (PDMS-2). Secondary outcomes included Canadian Occupational Performance 
      Measure (COPM), Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) and 
      Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). Outcome assessors were masked to group 
      allocation and data analyzed with multiple regression. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: All 
      n=30 infants enrolled received the assigned intervention until 16 weeks post 
      enrolment. At 12 months of age, n=26 completed assessments. Significant between 
      group differences were found in raw scores on the PDMS-2 in favour of GAME 
      (B=20.71, 95%CI 1.66-39.76, p=0. 03) and at 12 months on the total motor quotient 
      (B=8.29, 95%CI 0.13-16.45,p =0.05). Significant between group differences favored 
      GAME participants at 12 months on the cognitive scale of the BSID-III and 
      satisfaction scores on the COPM. CONCLUSION: GAME intervention resulted in 
      advanced motor and cognitive outcomes when compared with standard care.

AB  - Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that early-life stress (ELS) may 
      lead to the development of mental disorders in adulthood. Maternal separation 
      (MS) is a valid animal model of ELS that produces detrimental effects on brain 
      and behavior of experimental animals. Positive environmental stimuli have been 
      shown to counteract the behavioral deficits of ELS and enhance neuroplasticity. 
      Recent data indicate that music may serve as a form of environmental enrichment 
      in experimental animals. However, the underlying mechanisms through which musical 
      enrichment exerts its effects are poorly understood. Male Sprague-Dawley rats 
      were submitted to a 3 h MS protocol during postnatal days (PND) 2-14, while 
      another group was left undisturbed. Half of the animals within each group were 
      exposed from PND 21 to PND 76 for 12 h/day to Mozart K. 448. At approximately 
      three months of age, elevated plus maze procedure, forced swim test and social 
      approach task were applied to test whether music exposure can mitigate the 
      effects of MS stress on animal emotional behaviors. Moreover, we investigated the 
      effects of these treatments on dendritic spine density in the CA1 region of 
      hippocampus. As expected, MS rats showed decreased sociability, increased 
      anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and decreased mature dendritic spines in 
      the CA1 region of hippocampus in adulthood. Musical enrichment reversed these 
      effects. Our results suggest that musical enrichment can reverse the negative 
      effects of MS on anxiety, depression, and sociability in adult rats and modulate 
      neuronal plasticity and provide additional data for a new therapeutic 
      intervention to rescue emotional symptoms.

AB  - Environmental enrichment for mice lags behind the standard enrichment offered to 
      other laboratory rodents due to concerns about environmental variability and, in 
      specific contexts, aggression. Our objective in this study was to evaluate 
      concerns that the introduction of structural enrichment in the form of a single 
      red acrylic mouse tunnel into murine housing may confound study findings. We 
      measured effects on anxiety-like behaviors (elevated zero maze and open field 
      activity), hippocampal neurogenesis, body weight gain, and physiologic markers of 
      stress (adrenal gland weight, plasma corticosterone concentration, and 
      neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Male and female C57BL/6J mice were randomly 
      assigned to one of 2 groups: a standard-housed control group with enrichment 
      consisting of paper nesting material, or an enriched group that received a single 
      acrylic tunnel in addition to nesting material. All results fell within 
      biologically normal ranges regardless of treatment, and variability (standard 
      deviation) was not significantly different between groups for any measure. Mice 
      in the enriched group showed modest differences during open field testing 
      suggestive of decreased anxiety, traveling farther and depositing fewer fecal 
      boli than standard-housed mice. Male mice in the tunnel-enriched group gained 
      more body weight than standard-housed male mice. No significant effects by 
      treatment were found in neurogenic or physiologic parameters. These results 
      indicate that provision of simple structural enrichment is unlikely to have 
      confounding effects on murine anxiety-like behaviors, neurogenesis, body weight 
      gain, or physiologic parameters. We therefore recommend the inclusion of simple 
      structural enrichment, such as an acrylic tunnel, to the standard environmental 
      enrichment of social housing and nesting material for mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the beneficial effects of cerebrolysin (CBL) and 
      enriched environment (EE), alone or in combination, on the neurobehavioral and 
      molecular changes in the post-ischemic depression (PID) model in mice. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: PID was induced in male Balb/c mice (25-30 g) by combining the 
      transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (bCCAO), twice for 5 min at 
      the interval of 10 min, with spatial restraint stress (2 h/day) for 2 weeks, 
      started 48 h following the establishment of bCCAO model. Animals in the treatment 
      groups received CBL (2.5 ml/kg) and/or were housed in EE (2 h/day) for two weeks. 
      Anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and sociability were evaluated the day 
      after the last experiment. Changes in the serum corticosterone level, the 
      hippocampal oxidative stress status, inflammatory cytokines, brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding 
      protein (p-CREB)/CREB ratio were also detected. RESULTS: PID model induced 
      anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and impaired social behavior. These 
      behavioral changes were accompanied by increased serum corticosterone level, 
      increased lipid peroxidation, decreased antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced 
      BDNF levels and p-CREB/CREB ratio, and increased protein levels of NF-κB and 
      Iba-1 in the hippocampus. However, treatment with CBL and/or EE reversed 
      behavioral and molecular changes induced by PID. CONCLUSION: Our findings imply 
      that the model mimics many manifestations of human PID, and CBL and EE 
      treatments, separately or in combination, are beneficial in reducing anxiety- 
      and- depressive-like behaviors in this model.

AB  - Our prior research has shown that the transcription of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      stress transcription factors activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and ATF4 
      are induced by amphetamine and restraint stress in rat striatum. However, 
      presently the full extent of ER stress responses to psychological stress or 
      cocaine, and which of the three ER stress pathways is activated is unknown. The 
      current study examines transcriptional responses of key ER stress target genes 
      subsequent to psychological stress or cocaine. Rats were subjected to acute or 
      repeated restraint stress or cocaine treatment and mRNA was isolated from dorsal 
      striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens brain tissue. ER stress 
      gene mRNA expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) and RNA sequencing. Restraint stress and cocaine-induced transcription of 
      the classic ER stress-induced genes (BIP, CHOP, ATF3 and GADD34) and of two other 
      ER stress components x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and ATF6. In addition, rats 
      living in an enriched environment (large group cage with novel toys changed 
      daily) exhibited rapid induction of GADD34 and ATF3 after 30 min of exploring 
      novel toys, suggesting these genes are also involved in normal non-pathological 
      signaling. However, environmental enrichment, a paradigm that produces protective 
      addiction and depression phenotypes in rats, attenuated the rapid induction of 
      ATF3 and GADD34 after restraint stress. These experiments provide a sensitive 
      measure of ER stress and, more importantly, these results offer good evidence of 
      the activation of ER stress mechanisms from psychological stress, cocaine and 
      natural reward. Thus, ER stress genes may be targets for novel therapeutic 
      targets for depression and addiction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) manifests comorbid 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated 
      with an increased risk for dementia in late life, suggesting the two disorders 
      may share genetic etiologies. METHODS: We performed genetic pleiotropy analysis 
      using LOAD and PTSD genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets from white and 
      African-American populations, followed by functional-genomic analyses. RESULTS: 
      We found an enrichment for LOAD across increasingly stringent levels of 
      significance with the PTSD GWAS association (LOAD|PTSD) in the discovery and 
      replication cohorts and a modest enrichment for the reverse conditional 
      association (PTSD|LOAD). LOAD|PTSD association analysis identified and replicated 
      the MS4A genes region. These genes showed similar expression pattern in brain 
      regions affected in LOAD, and across-brain-tissue analysis identified a 
      significant association for MS4A6A. The African-American samples showed moderate 
      enrichment; however, no false discovery rate-significant associations. 
      DISCUSSION: We demonstrated common genetic signatures for LOAD and PTSD and 
      suggested immune response as a common pathway for these diseases.

AB  - Early life stress is associated with long-term and pervasive adverse effects on 
      neuroendocrine development, affecting normal cognitive and emotional development. 
      Experimental manipulations like environmental enrichment (EE) may potentially 
      reverse the effects of early life stress induced by maternal separation (MS) 
      paradigm in rodents. However, the functional brain networks involved in the 
      effects of EE after prolonged exposure to MS have not yet been investigated. In 
      order to evaluate possible changes in brain functional connectivity induced by EE 
      after MS, quantitative cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) histochemistry was applied to 
      determine regional brain oxidative metabolism in adult male rats. Unexpectedly, 
      results show that prolonged MS during the entire weaning period did not cause any 
      detrimental effects on spatial learning and memory, including depressive-like 
      behavior evaluated in the forced-swim test, and decreased anxiety-like behavior. 
      However, EE seemed to alter anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in both 
      control and MS groups, but improved spatial memory in the latter groups. Analysis 
      of brain CCO activity showed significantly lower metabolic capacity in most brain 
      regions selected in EE groups probably associated with chronic stress, but no 
      effects of MS on brain metabolic capacity. In addition, principal component 
      analysis of CCO activity revealed increased large-scale functional brain 
      connectivity comprising at least three main networks affected by EE in both MS 
      and control groups. Moreover, EE induced a pattern of functional brain 
      connectivity associated with stress and anxiety-like behavior as compared with 
      non-enriched groups. In conclusion, EE had differential effects on cognition and 
      emotional behavior irrespective of exposure to MS. In view of the remarkable 
      effects of EE on brain function and behavior, implementation of rodent housing 
      conditions should be optimized by evaluating the balance between scientific 
      validity and animal welfare.

TI  - Childhood trauma and post-trauma environment affect fear memory and alcohol use 
      differently in male and female mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood trauma is associated with the development of adult mental 
      health and substance use disorders, with females generally being more at risk. 
      Alcohol is commonly used for coping with trauma, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) 
      affects ∼14.4 million adult Americans annually. Research investigating sex 
      differences in the environmental modification of anxiety and alcohol use 
      following childhood trauma will extend our understanding of the etiology of AUD. 
      Here, we sought to model the interacting effects of a single-episode late 
      childhood trauma with post-trauma environment on adult alcohol use using male and 
      female mice. METHODS: C57Bl6/J mice (d22) exposed to predator odor (TMT) or water 
      were reared in standard environments (SE) or environmental enrichment (EE). Mice 
      were assessed for adolescent anxiety and conditioned fear, and for adult alcohol 
      use in a limited access, response non-contingent, alcohol exposure paradigm. 
      RESULTS: A single exposure to predator odor was an effective stressor, inducing 
      long-term sex-dependent changes in conditioned fear and alcohol behaviors that 
      interacted with post-trauma environment. Adolescent EE females showed more 
      conditioned freezing to the trauma-associated context. Adult EE mice consumed 
      less total alcohol than SE mice. However, alcohol use across time differed for 
      males and females. Exposure to a childhood stressor increased alcohol use 
      significantly in females, but not males. EE males, but not EE females, drank less 
      than SE counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this model recapitulate greater 
      vulnerability to childhood trauma in females and support sex differences in 
      post-trauma development of conditioned fear and alcohol use that are modified by 
      environment.

TI  - Environmental Enrichment Rescues Oxidative Stress and Behavioral Impairments 
      Induced by Maternal Care Deprivation: Sex- and Developmental-Dependent 
      Differences.
LID - 10.1007/s12035-021-02588-3 [doi]
AB  - Stress is related to major depressive disorder (MDD). This study investigated the 
      action that early stress, represented by maternal deprivation (MD), has on the 
      behavior and oxidative stress of Wistar female and male rats. Also, it was 
      evaluated whether changes induced by MD could be reversed by environmental 
      enrichment (EE). Male and female rats were divided into a non-MD and MD group. 
      The MD group was subdivided into 3 groups: (1) assessed on the 31(st) day after 
      exposure to EE for 10 days, (2) assessed on the 41(st) day after exposure to EE 
      for 20 days, and (3) assessed on the 61(st) day after exposure to EE for 40 days. 
      Behavioral tests were performed (memory habituation and elevated plus maze). 
      Oxidative stress parameters were evaluated peripherally. MD was able to promote 
      anxiety-like behavior at postnatal day (PND) 41 and impair memory at PND 31 and 
      PND 61 in male and PND 41 and PND 61 in female rats. MD was associated with 
      increased oxidative stress parameters (reactive species to thiobarbituric acid 
      levels (TBARS), carbonylated proteins, nitrite/nitrate concentration), and 
      altered antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and 
      sulfhydryl content) in different stages of development. The EE was able to 
      reverse almost all behavioral and biochemical changes induced by MD; however, EE 
      effects were sex and developmental period dependent. These findings reinforce the 
      understanding of the gender variable as a biological factor in MDD related to MD 
      and EE could be considered a treatment option for MDD treatment and its 
      comorbidities.

TI  - Adolescent stress sensitizes the adult neuroimmune transcriptome and leads to 
      sex-specific microglial and behavioral phenotypes.
PG  - 949-958

AB  - Adolescent exposure to chronic stress, a risk factor for mood disorders in 
      adulthood, sensitizes the neuroinflammatory response to a subsequent immune 
      challenge. We previously showed that chronic adolescent stress (CAS) in rats led 
      to distinct patterns of neuroimmune priming in adult male and female rats. 
      However, sex differences in the neuroimmune consequences of CAS and their 
      underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we hypothesized that 
      biological sex would dictate differential induction of inflammation-related 
      transcriptomic pathways and immune cell involvement (microglia activation and 
      leukocyte presence) in the hippocampus of male and female rats with a history of 
      CAS. Adolescent rats underwent CAS (six restraint and six social defeat episodes 
      during postnatal days 38-49), and behavioral assessments were conducted in 
      adolescence and adulthood. Neuroimmune measures were obtained following vehicle 
      or a systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in adulthood. CAS led to 
      increased time in the corners of the open field in adolescence. In males, CAS 
      also increased social avoidance. As adults, CAS rats displayed an exaggerated 
      enrichment of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
      (NFκB) pathway and chemokine induction following LPS challenge, and increased 
      number of perivascular CD45(+) cells in the hippocampus. However, CAS females, 
      but not males, showed exaggerated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway enrichment 
      and increased microglial complexity. These results provide further insight to the 
      mechanisms by which peripheral immune events may influence neuroimmune responses 
      differentially among males and females and further demonstrate the importance of 
      adolescent stress in shaping adult responses.

      Enhanced Ethanol Intake during Periadolescence and Early Adulthood.

AB  - This study analyzed ethanol intake in male and female Wistar rats exposed to 
      maternal separation (MS) during infancy (postnatal days 1-21, PD1-21) and 
      environmental enrichment (EE) during adolescence (PD 21-42). Previous work 
      revealed that MS enhances ethanol consumption during adulthood. It is still 
      unknown if a similar effect is found during adolescence. Several studies, in 
      turn, have revealed that EE reverses stress experiences, and reduces ethanol 
      consumption and reinforcement; although others reported greater ethanol intake 
      after EE. The interactive effects between these treatments upon ethanol's effects 
      and intake have yet to be explored. We assessed chronic ethanol intake and 
      preference (12 two-bottle daily sessions, spread across 30 days, 1st session on 
      PD46) in rats exposed to MS and EE. The main finding was that male - but not 
      female - rats that had been exposed to EE consumed more ethanol than controls 
      given standard housing, an effect that was not affected by MS. Subsequent 
      experiments assessed several factors associated with heightened ethanol 
      consumption in males exposed to MS and EE; namely taste aversive conditioning and 
      hypnotic-sedative consequences of ethanol. We also measured anxiety response in 
      the light-dark box and in the elevated plus maze tests; and exploratory patterns 
      of novel stimuli and behaviors indicative of risk assessment and risk-taking, via 
      a modified version of the concentric square field (CSF) test. Aversive 
      conditioning, hypnosis and sleep time were similar in males exposed or not to EE. 
      EE males, however, exhibited heightened exploration of novel stimuli and greater 
      risk taking behaviors in the CSF test. It is likely that the promoting effect of 
      EE upon ethanol intake was due to these effects upon exploratory and risk-taking 
      behaviors.

      prevented stress-induced increases in anxiety (emerging 10 days post-stress) in 
      adult rats without blocking stress-induced dendritic branch remodeling in the BLA 
      nor stress-induced enhancement of GC serum levels.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is the enhancement of the physical or social environment 
      in which an animal lives with the goal to improve its quality of life. Our 
      objective was to investigate the effect of providing environmental enrichment in 
      the home pen on responsiveness to novelty in laboratory-housed pigs. Pigs were 
      housed (4 pigs per pen) in enriched (n = 32) or barren (control; n = 32) pens for 
      3 wk total and tested in 2 anxiety behavioral tests, the novel object (NOT) and 
      human interaction (HIT) tests. Pigs were placed in a novel arena for a 5-min 
      familiarization period, after which either a novel object (NOT) or an unfamiliar 
      human (HIT) was introduced for a 5-min interaction period. Behavior in the home 
      pen and during NOT and HIT was monitored through direct observations and 
      videorecording. In the home pen, enriched pigs spent more time active and 
      interacting with the environment, whereas control pigs spent more time inactive 
      and in social interactions. In addition, enriched pigs crossed more squares 
      during the familiarization period, tended to freeze more, and interacted less 
      with the novel object or person than control pigs. In conclusion, enrichment may 
      improve welfare by stimulating activity and decreasing aggressive behaviors in 
      the home pen. However, enriched pigs may experience increased anxiety when 
      exposed to novelty, whereas pigs housed without environmental enrichment-due to 
      lack of stimulation in the home pen-may be more motivated to interact with 
      sources of novelty or enrichment during testing than their enriched counterparts.

AB  - Environmental factors seem to play a key role in brain and behavioral 
      development, both in humans and animals. Different environmental manipulations, 
      either pre- or post-natal, have been shown to exert long-term physiological and 
      behavioral effects. While studies in the field of Enriched Environment mainly 
      focus on the post weaning period and provide enrichment as a post 
      adverse-experience manipulation, the preceding effects of prenatal Enriched 
      Environment have rarely been investigated. In this study, we investigated the 
      effects of prenatal Enriched Environment (through the entire pregnancy) followed 
      by adulthood acute stress. In the prenatal Enriched Environment offspring, we 
      found anxiety and depressive-like behaviors with poor attentional performance. 
      Surprisingly, when prenatal Enriched Environment was followed by adulthood 
      stress, we observed a dramatic restoration of these behavioral deficits. Our 
      results suggest that prenatal Enriched Environment may substrate resiliency to 
      adulthood stress.

AB  - Here we discuss the role of diverse environmental manipulations affecting 
      cognition with special regard to psychiatric conditions. We present evidence 
      supporting a direct causal correlation between the valence of the environmental 
      stimulation and some psychopathological traits and how the environment influences 
      brain structure and function with special regard to oxidative stress and 
      mitochondrial activity. Increasing experimental evidence supports a role for 
      mitochondrial dysfunctions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Brain mitochondria are 
      considered crucial mediators of allostasis, that is the capability to adapt to 
      stress via a complex interaction between the autonomic, metabolic, and immune 
      systems to maintain cellular homeostasis. In this process, mitochondria act as 
      highly dynamic integrators by sensing and transducing stressors into adaptation 
      mechanisms via metabolic stress mediators, such as glucocorticoids and 
      catecholamines. Alterations in cellular homeostasis induced by chronic stress are 
      thought to predispose to disease by triggering the so-called "mitochondrial 
      allostatic load". This process is characterized by functional and structural 
      changes of the mitochondria, ultimately leading to oxidative stress, 
      inflammation, mitochondrial DNA damage and apoptosis. In this review we discuss 
      the role of diverse environmental manipulations to affect cognition with special 
      regard to psychiatric conditions. How the environment influences brain structure 
      and function, and the interactions between rearing conditions, oxidative stress 
      and mitochondrial activity are fundamental questions that are still poorly 
      understood. As will be discussed, increasing experimental evidence supports a 
      role for mitochondrial dysfunctions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Brain 
      mitochondria are considered crucial mediators of allostasis, that is the 
      capability to adapt to stress via a complex interaction between the autonomic, 
      metabolic, and immune systems to maintain cellular homeostasis. In this process, 
      mitochondria act as highly dynamic integrators by sensing and transducing 
      stressors into adaptation mechanisms via metabolic stress mediators, such as 
      glucocorticoids and catecholamines. Alterations in cellular homeostasis induced 
      by chronic stress are thought to predispose to disease by triggering the 
      so-called "mitochondrial allostatic load". This process is characterized by 
      functional and structural changes of the mitochondria, ultimately leading to 
      oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial DNA damage and apoptosis. The brain 
      requires considerable mitochondrial reserve not only to sustain basal neuronal 
      needs but also to provide increasing energy demands during stress. Consistently 
      with these high energetic requirements, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the 
      brain is particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial defects. Thus, even subtle 
      metabolic alterations might have a substantial impact on cognitive functions. 
      Over the last decade, several experimental evidence supported the hypothesis that 
      a suboptimal mitochondrial function, which could be of genetic origin or acquired 
      following adverse life events, is a key vulnerability factor for stress-related 
      psychopathologies. Chronic psychological stress is a major promoter of anxiety as 
      well as of oxidative damage, as shown in several studies. Recent evidence from 
      mouse models harbouring mutations in mitochondrial genes demonstrated the role of 
      mitochondria in modulating the response to acute psychological stress. However, 
      it has yet to be determined whether mitochondrial dysfunctions are the cause or 
      the consequence of anxiety. In this review, we discuss how adverse psychosocial 
      environments can impact mitochondrial bioenergetics at the molecular level and we 
      gather evidence from several studies linking energy metabolism and stress 
      resilience/vulnerability. Moreover, we review recent findings supporting that 
      metabolic dysfunction can underlie deficits in complex social behaviours. As will 
      be discussed, aberrations in mitochondrial functionality have been found in the 
      nucleus accumbens of highly anxious mice and mediate low social competitiveness. 
      In addition, alterations in sociability can be reversed by enhancing 
      mitochondrial functions. Recent evidence also demonstrated that a specific 
      mutation in mitochondrial DNA, previously linked to autism spectrum disorder, 
      produces autistic endophenotypes in mice by altering respiration chain and 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Finally, we discuss a "Negative 
      Enrichment" model that can explain some of the psychopathological conditions 
      relevant to humans. Evidence of a direct causal correlation of valence of 
      environmental stimulation and psychopathological traits will be presented, and 
      possible molecular mechanisms that focus on oxidative stress. Collectively, the 
      findings described here have been achieved with a wide set of behavioural and 
      cognitive tasks with translational validity. Thus, they will be useful for future 
      work aimed to elucidate the fine metabolic alterations in psychopathologies and 
      devise novel approaches targeting mitochondria to alleviate these conditions.

AB  - The medial-lateral habenula (LHbM)'s role in anxiety and depression behaviors in 
      female mice remains unclear. Here, we used neonatal maternal deprivation (MD) and 
      post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE) to treat female BALB/c offspring and 
      checked anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors as well as the 
      corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), oxytocin receptor (OTR), estrogen 
      receptor-beta (ERβ) levels in their LHbM at adulthood. We found that MD enhanced 
      state anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze test, and EE caused trait 
      anxiety-like behaviors in the open field test and depression-like behaviors in 
      the tail suspension test. The immunochemistry showed that MD reduced OT 
      immunoreactive neuron numbers in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus but 
      increased OTR levels in the LHbM; EE increased CRH levels in the LHbM but 
      decreased OTR levels in the LHbM. The additive effects of EE and MD maintained 
      the behavioral parameters, OT-ir neuronal numbers, CRH levels, and OTR levels 
      similar to the additive of non-MD and non-EE. The correlation analysis showed 
      that CRH levels correlated with synaptic connection levels, OTR levels correlated 
      with nucleus densities, and ERβ levels correlated with Nissl body levels and body 
      weights in female mice. Neither MD nor EE affected ERβ levels in the LHbM. 
      Together, the study revealed the relationships between behaviors and 
      neuroendocrine and neuronal alterations in female LHbM and the effects of 
      experiences including MD and EE on them.

TI  - The influence of complex and threatening environments in early life on brain size

AB  - The ways in which challenging environments during development shape the brain and 
      behaviour are increasingly being addressed. To date, studies typically consider 
      only single variables, but the real world is more complex. Many factors 
      simultaneously affect the brain and behaviour, and whether these work 
      independently or interact remains untested. To address this, zebrafish (Danio 
      rerio) were reared in a two-by-two design in housing that varied in structural 
      complexity and/or exposure to a stressor. Fish experiencing both complexity 
      (enrichment objects changed over time) and mild stress (daily net chasing) 
      exhibited enhanced learning and were less anxious when tested as juveniles 
      (between 77 and 90 days). Adults tested (aged 1 year) were also less anxious even 
      though fish were kept in standard housing after three months of age (i.e. no 
      chasing or enrichment). Volumetric measures of the brain using magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) showed that complexity alone generated fish with a larger brain, 
      but this increase in size was not seen in fish that experienced both complexity 
      and chasing, or chasing alone. The results highlight the importance of looking at 
      multiple variables simultaneously, and reveal differential effects of complexity 
      and stressful experiences during development of the brain and behaviour.

TI  - Short environmental enrichment in adulthood reverses anxiety and basolateral 
      amygdala hypertrophy induced by maternal separation.
PG  - e729
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.217 [doi]
AB  - Maternal separation during early childhood results in greater sensitivity to 
      stressors later in adult life. This is reflected as greater propensity to develop 
      stress-related disorders in humans and animal models, including anxiety and 
      depression. Environmental enrichment (EE) reverses some of the damaging effects 
      of maternal separation in rodent models when provided during peripubescent life, 
      temporally proximal to the separation. It is presently unknown if EE provided 
      outside this critical window can still rescue separation-induced anxiety and 
      neural plasticity. In this report we use a rat model to demonstrate that a single 
      short episode of EE in adulthood reduced anxiety-like behaviour in maternally 
      separated rats. We further show that maternal separation resulted in hypertrophy 
      of dendrites and increase in spine density of basolateral amygdala neurons in 
      adulthood, long after initial stress treatment. This is congruent with prior 
      observations showing centrality of basolateral amygdala hypertrophy in anxiety 
      induced by stress during adulthood. In line with the ability of the adult 
      enrichment to rescue stress-induced anxiety, we show that enrichment renormalized 
      stress-induced structural expansion of the amygdala neurons. These observations 
      argue that behavioural plasticity induced by early adversity can be rescued by 
      environmental interventions much later in life, likely mediated by ameliorating 
      effects of enrichment on basolateral amygdala plasticity.

TI  - Environmental enrichment mitigates PTSD-like behaviors in adult male rats exposed 
      to early life stress by regulating histone acetylation in the hippocampus and 
      amygdala.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) can cause long-term changes in gene expression, affect 
      cognition, mood, and behavior, and increase susceptibility to post-traumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood, in which the histone acetylation plays a 
      crucial role. Studies have found that environmental enrichment (EE) mitigated the 
      unfavorable outcomes of ELS. However, the underlying mechanism of the histone 
      acetylation is not yet completely clear. The purpose of this study was to explore 
      the effect of EE on the histone acetylation after ELS. In this study, using 
      single prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm in early adolescent rats explored the 
      long-term effects of ELS on behavior, the activity of histone acetyltransferases 
      (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), as well as the acetylation levels of the 
      lysine 9 site of histone H3 (H3K9) and lysine 12 site of histone H4 (H4K12) in 
      the hippocampus and amygdala. Meanwhile, the protective effects of EE 
      intervention were examined. We found that adult male rats exposed to ELS showed 
      behavioral changes, including reduced locomotor activity, increased anxiety-like 
      behaviors, impaired spatial learning and memory, enhanced contextual and cued 
      fear memory, and the HATs/HDACs ratio and acetyl H3K9 (Ac-H3K9) and acetyl H4K12 
      (Ac-H4K12) were increased in the hippocampus and decreased in the amygdala. 
      Furthermore, EE attenuated the behavioral abnormalities from ELS, possibly 
      through down-regulating the activity of HATs in the hippocampus and up-regulating 
      HDACs activities in the amygdala. These finding suggested that EE could 
      ameliorate ELS-induced PTSD-like behaviors by regulating histone acetylation in 
      the hippocampus and amygdala, reducing the susceptibility to PTSD in adulthood.

TI  - Collective leadership to improve professional practice, healthcare outcomes and 
      staff well-being.
PG  - CD013850
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD013850.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD013850
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collective leadership is strongly advocated by international 
      stakeholders as a key approach for health service delivery, as a response to 
      increasingly complex forms of organisation defined by rapid changes in health 
      technology, professionalisation and growing specialisation. Inadequate leadership 
      weakens health systems and can contribute to adverse events, including refusal to 
      prioritise and implement safety recommendations consistently, and resistance to 
      addressing staff burnout. Globally, increases in life expectancy and the number 
      of people living with multiple long-term conditions contribute to 
      greater complexity of healthcare systems. Such a complex environment requires the 
      contribution and leadership of multiple professionals sharing viewpoints and 
      knowledge.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of collective leadership for 
      healthcare providers on professional practice, healthcare outcomes and staff 
      well-being, when compared with usual centralised leadership approaches. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases and two 
      trials registers on 5 January 2021. We also searched grey literature, checked 
      references for additional citations and contacted study authors to identify 
      additional studies. We did not apply any limits on language. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      Two groups of two authors independently reviewed, screened and selected studies 
      for inclusion; the principal author was part of both groups to ensure 
      consistency. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared 
      collective leadership interventions with usual centralised leadership or no 
      intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three groups of two authors 
      independently extracted data from the included studies and evaluated study 
      quality; the principal author took part in all groups. We followed standard 
      methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and the Effective Practice and 
      Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the 
      certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three randomised trials 
      for inclusion in our synthesis. All studies were conducted in acute care 
      inpatient settings; the country settings were Canada, Iran and the USA. A total 
      of 955 participants were included across all the studies. There was considerable 
      variation in participants, interventions and measures for quantifying outcomes. 
      We were only able to complete a meta-analysis for one outcome (leadership) and 
      completed a narrative synthesis for other outcomes. We judged all studies as 
      having an unclear risk of bias overall. Collective leadership interventions 
      probably improve leadership (3 RCTs, 955 participants). Collective leadership may 
      improve team performance (1 RCT, 164 participants). We are uncertain about the 
      effect of collective leadership on clinical performance (1 RCT, 60 participants). 
      We are uncertain about the intervention effect on healthcare outcomes, including 
      health status (inpatient mortality) (1 RCT, 60 participants). Collective 
      leadership may slightly improve staff well-being by reducing work-related stress 
      (1 RCT, 164 participants). We identified no direct evidence concerning burnout 
      and psychological symptoms. We are uncertain of the intervention effects on 
      unintended consequences, specifically on staff absence (1 RCT, 60 participants).  
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Collective leadership involves multiple professionals 
      sharing viewpoints and knowledge with the potential to influence positively the 
      quality of care and staff well-being. Our confidence in the effects of collective 
      leadership interventions on professional practice, healthcare outcomes and staff 
      well-being is moderate in leadership outcomes, low in team performance and 
      work-related stress, and very low for clinical performance, inpatient mortality 
      and staff absence outcomes. The evidence was of moderate, low and very low 
      certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision, meaning future evidence may change 
      our interpretation of the results. There is a need for more high-quality studies 
      in this area, with consistent reporting of leadership, team performance, clinical 
      performance, health status and staff well-being outcomes.

AB  - Environmental stress contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders, 
      including posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety. While even acute stress 
      alters gene expression, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain 
      largely unknown. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a novel environmentally 
      sensitive DNA modification that is highly enriched in the brain and is associated 
      with active transcription of neuronal genes. Here we examined behavioral and 
      molecular alterations in adult mice that experienced an early-life stress before 
      weaning (postnatal day 12 to 18) and found anxiety-like behaviors in adult female 
      mice that were accompanied by correlated disruptions of hypothalamic 5hmC and 
      gene expression in 118 genes, revealing potentially functional 5hmC (i.e., gene 
      regulation). These genes are known and potentially novel stress-related targets, 
      including Nr3c2, Nrxn1, Nfia, and Clip1, that have a significant enrichment for 
      neuronal ontological functions, such as neuronal development and differentiation. 
      Sequence motif predictions indicated that 5hmC may regulate gene expression by 
      mediating transcription factor binding and alternative splicing of many of these 
      transcripts. Together, these findings represent a critical step toward 
      understanding the effects of early environment on the neuromolecular mechanisms 
      that underlie the risk to develop anxiety disorders.

AB  - Adverse events in early life have been related to a maladaptive stress response 
      during adulthood, which could predispose individuals to psychiatric and 
      physiological disorders. The purpose of this work was to study the implications 
      of repeated maternal separation (RMS) plus a physical stressor (cold stress), 
      voluntary ethanol consumption and plasmatic levels of corticosterone (Cor) via 
      conflict behavior tests. To this aim, pups were separated daily from their 
      mothers for one hour and subjected to cold stress (4 °C) between postnatal days 
      (PD) 2 and 20. Control groups were left undisturbed with their mothers. 
      Afterwards, all groups were exposed to voluntary ethanol (6%) or dextrose (1%) 
      intake for 7 days. After a 30-day period of environmental enrichment (EE), the 
      animals were again exposed to the voluntary intake protocol for 7 days. At 
      66 days, they were subjected to different conflict tests. Thereafter, rats were 
      sacrificed by decapitation and blood trunk was collected to determine plasma 
      corticosterone levels. We demonstrated that early RMS increased both voluntary 
      alcohol intake and Cor levels. Moreover, young adult animals showed excessive 
      activity in conflict tests. Whereas in animals exposed to a non-pharmacological 
      treatment, known as environmental enrichment (EE), the effects previously 
      obtained were reversed and/or prevented. In summary, we can conclude that the 
      combination of maternal separation in early life plus cold stress increase both 
      the voluntary exposure to alcohol and disruptive behaviors. This is a risk factor 
      for the development of chronic diseases such as alcoholism and long-term 
      depression. However, we found that an enriched environment may have a beneficial 
      effect with respect to alcohol intake and aggressive behaviors.

TI  - The effect of oxytocin and an enriched environment on anxiety-like behaviour and 
      corticosterone levels in a prenatally stressed febrile seizure rat model.
PG  - 47-56
LID - 10.1016/j.ibneur.2022.05.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile seizures (FS) are a neurological abnormality which occur 
      following a fever that has resulted from a systemic infection and are 
      characterised by convulsions. These convulsions occur due to abnormally increased 
      signalling of interleukin-1 beta, resulting in increased neuronal 
      hyper-excitability. Furthermore, exposure to prenatal stress has been shown to 
      exacerbate seizure duration, elicit anxiety-like behaviour and corticosterone 
      levels. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide with anxiolytic, social bonding, and stress 
      regulation effects. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess whether 
      oxytocin can attenuate the anxiety-like behaviour and increased corticosterone in 
      rat offspring exposed to prenatal stress and FS. METHOD: Sprague Dawley rats were 
      mated. On GND14, prenatal stress was induced on pregnant dams for 1 hr/7 days. On 
      PND 14, rat pups were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 200 μg/kg, i.p.) 
      followed 2.5 h later by an i.p. injection of kainic acid (KA, 1.75 mg/kg). 
      Oxytocin (1 mg/kg) was induced via different routes (intraperitoneal or 
      intranasal) as well an enriched environment between PND 22-26. The enriched 
      environment included larger cages (1560 cm(2)) with only 4 pups per cage, 
      compared to those groups not receiving enrichment (646 cm(2)), as well as 
      cardboard rolls and plastic toys. On PND 27-33 the light/dark box and elevated 
      plus maze were used to assess anxiety-like behaviour. On PND 34 all rats were 
      euthanized using a sharp guillotine, trunk blood and hypothalamic tissue were 
      collected for neurochemical analysis (ELISA kit). RESULTS: Our findings confirmed 
      that exposure to both prenatal stress and febrile seizures resulted anxiety-like 
      behaviour and significantly higher plasma corticosterone concentrations compared 
      to their counterparts. Environmental enrichment was significantly effective in 
      attenuating the increased basal corticosterone levels and anxiety-like behaviour 
      seen in the prenatally stressed FS rat. Although direct administration of 
      oxytocin showed higher significance in reducing corticosterone plasma levels when 
      compared to the enriched environment. Furthermore, hypothalamic oxytocin levels 
      were not significant in rat exposed to environmental enrichment while oxytocin 
      treatment showed a significant effect when compared to their counterparts. 
      CONCLUSION: Therefore, oxytocin administration during early postnatal development 
      shows great potential in reversing the effects of prenatal stress and its 
      subsequent exacerbation of FS.

AB  - Parental effects influence offspring phenotypes through pre- and post-natal 
      routes but little is known about their molecular basis, and therefore their 
      adaptive significance. Epigenetic modifications, which control gene expression 
      without changes in the DNA sequence and are influenced by the environment, may 
      contribute to parental effects. We investigated the effects of environmental 
      enrichment on the behaviour, metabolic rate and brain DNA methylation patterns of 
      parents and offspring of the highly inbreed mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias 
      marmoratus). Parental fish reared in enriched environments had lower cortisol 
      levels, lower metabolic rates and were more active and neophobic than those 
      reared in barren environments. They also differed in 1,854 methylated cytosines 
      (DMCs). Offspring activity and neophobia were determined by the parental 
      environment. Among the DMCs of the parents, 98 followed the same methylation 
      patterns in the offspring, three of which were significantly influenced by 
      parental environments irrespective of their own rearing environment. Our results 
      suggest that parental environment influences the behaviour and, to some extent, 
      the brain DNA methylation patterns of the offspring.

TI  - Effect of Environmental Complexity and Stocking Density on Fear and Anxiety in 
      Broiler Chickens.
LID - 10.3390/ani11082383 [doi]
LID - 2383
AB  - Barren housing and high stocking densities may contribute to negative affective 
      states in broiler chickens, reducing their welfare. We investigated the effects 
      of environmental complexity and stocking density on broilers' attention bias 
      (measure of anxiety) and tonic immobility (measure of fear). In Experiment 1, 
      individual birds were tested for attention bias (n = 60) and in Experiment 2, 
      groups of three birds were tested (n = 144). Tonic immobility testing was 
      performed on days 12 and 26 (n = 36) in Experiment 1, and on day 19 (n = 72) in 
      Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, no differences were observed in the attention bias 
      test. In Experiment 2, birds from high-complexity pens began feeding faster and 
      more birds resumed feeding than from low-complexity pens following playback of an 
      alarm call, suggesting that birds housed in the complex environment were less 
      anxious. Furthermore, birds housed in high-density or high-complexity pens had 
      shorter tonic immobility durations on day 12 compared to day 26 in Experiment 1. 
      In Experiment 2, birds from high-density pens had shorter tonic immobility 
      durations than birds housed in low-density pens, which is contrary to 
      expectations. Our results suggest that birds at 3 weeks of age were less fearful 
      under high stocking density conditions than low density conditions. In addition, 
      results indicated that the complex environment improved welfare of broilers 
      through reduced anxiety.

AB  - Maternal separation (MS) early in life is related to an increase in anxiety and 
      depressive-like behaviors and neurobiological alterations mostly related to 
      alterations in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. 
      Environmental enrichment (EE) has been used to ameliorate the effects of MS. 
      However, the outcomes of this intervention at different developmental periods 
      after MS have not been studied. We subjected male and female Sprague-Dawley pups 
      to MS and subsequently compared the effects of EE started either in the 
      pre-pubertal period [postnatal day (PND) 22] or adulthood (PND 78). Anxiety and 
      depressive-like behaviors as well as in hippocampal synaptic density and basal 
      corticosterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin levels were measured. Our results 
      support the beneficial effects of adulthood EE in decreasing anxiety in males as 
      well as promoting synaptic density in ventral hippocampal CA3. Males displayed 
      higher levels of vasopressin while females displayed higher oxytocin, with no 
      changes in basal corticosterone for any group after EE.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental animal model that enhances an 
      animal's opportunity to interact with sensory, motor, and social stimuli, 
      compared to standard laboratory conditions. A prominent benefit of EE is the 
      reduction of stress-induced anxiety. The relationship between stress and the 
      onset of anxiety-like behavior has been widely investigated in experimental 
      research, showing a clear correlation with structural changes in the hippocampus 
      and basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, the mechanisms by which EE exerts its 
      protective roles in stress and anxiety remain unclear, and it is not known 
      whether EE reduces the effects of acute stress on animal behavior shortly 
      following the cessation of stress. We found that EE can prevent the emergence of 
      anxiety-like symptoms in rats measured immediately after acute restraint stress 
      (1 h) and this effect is not due to changes in systemic release of 
      corticosterone. Rather, we found that stress promotes a rapid increase in the 
      nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the BLA, an effect 
      prevented by previous EE exposure. Furthermore, we observed a reduction of ERK (a 
      MAPK protein) and CREB activity in the BLA promoted by both EE and acute stress. 
      Finally, we found that EE decreases the expression of the immediate-early gene 
      EGR-1 in the BLA, indicating a possible reduction of neuronal activity in this 
      region. Hyperactivity of BLA neurons has been reported to accompany anxiety-like 
      behavior and changes in this process may be one of the mechanism by which EE 
      exerts its protective effects against stress-induced anxiety.

TI  - The Medial Prefrontal Cortex, Nucleus Accumbens, Basolateral Amygdala, and 
      Hippocampus Regulate the Amelioration of Environmental Enrichment and Cue in Fear 
      Behavior in the Animal Model of PTSD.
PG  - 7331714

AB  - A growing body of evidence showed that environmental enrichment (EE) ameliorated 
      footshock-induced fear behavior of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, 
      no research comprehensively tested the effect of EE, cue, and the combination of 
      EE and cue in footshock-induced fear behavior of PTSD symptoms. The present study 
      addressed this issue and examined whether the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, 
      including the cingulate cortex 1 (Cg1), prelimbic cortex (PrL), and infralimbic 
      cortex (IL)), the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and 
      the hippocampus (e.g., CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG)) regulated the 
      amelioration of the EE, cue, or the combination of EE and cue. The results showed 
      that EE or cue could reduce fear behavior. The combination of EE and cue revealed 
      a stronger decrease in fear behavior. The cue stimulus may play an occasion 
      setting or a conditioned stimulus to modulate the reduction in fear behavior 
      induced by footshock. Regarding the reduction of the EE in fear behavior, the Cg1 
      and IL of the mPFC and the NAc upregulated the c-Fos expression; however, the BLA 
      downregulated the c-Fos expression. The mPFC (i.e., the Cg1, PrL, and IL) and the 
      hippocampus (i.e., the CA1, CA3, and DG) downregulated the c-Fos expression in 
      the suppression of the cue in fear behavior. The interaction of EE and cue in 
      reduction of fear behavior occurred in the Cg1 and NAc for the c-Fos expression. 
      The data of c-Fos mRNA were similar to the findings of the c-Fos protein 
      expression. These findings related to the EE and cue modulations in fear behavior 
      may develop a novel nonpharmacological treatment in PTSD.

TI  - Preweaning housing effects on behavior and physiological measures in pigs during 
      the suckling and fattening periods.
PG  - 1741-9
AB  - The effect of the preweaning housing system on the stress response of pigs before 
      weaning and during fattening was studied in 33 litters of domestic pigs. Three 
      preweaning housing systems were compared: barren crate (standard farrowing crate 
      without straw), enriched crate (20% larger crate, with straw), and as a control, 
      a farrowing pen (pen, 60% larger than the barren crate, with straw). At 25 d of 
      age, pigs were tested with an isolation test and 1 d later with a human approach 
      test (HumanT). Pigs were weaned at 28 d of age. At 3 and 6 mo of age, pigs were 
      tested with an isolation-human approach test. The latency and frequency of squeal 
      calls and locomotor activity were analyzed for all 3 tests, whereas physical 
      contact with the human was also analyzed for the HumanT and isolation-human 
      approach test. At 6 mo of age, the pigs were transported to a slaughterhouse. One 
      day before transport, immediately after transport, and 1 h after transport, 
      saliva samples were taken for cortisol analysis. The pH of the LM was also 
      measured 45 min after slaughter. Preweaning housing system affected (P < 0.05) 
      the probability of squeal vocalizations, the latency of locomotion, and the 
      duration of locomotion during the HumanT. Pigs from the enriched pens vocalized 
      less, had a longer latency to move, and performed less overall locomotion than 
      pigs from the barren crates. Preweaning housing system did not affect behavior of 
      fattening pigs. Cortisol concentrations before and after transport were not 
      affected by preweaning housing system. An interaction of cortisol concentrations 
      and housing systems was observed between the control sample and the sample taken 
      immediately after transport in pigs from the barren crates (P < 0.05) compared 
      with pigs from the enriched housing systems. Meat from pigs reared in the barren 
      crate tended to have lower pH (P < 0.10) and that of pigs reared in enriched 
      crates had lower pH (P < 0.05) than meat of pigs reared in enriched pens. No 
      differences were observed between pigs from barren or enriched crates. Our 
      results suggest that enrichment of the preweaning environment through enlarged 
      space, provision of straw, and free movement for the sow had a positive effect on 
      the coping behavior of pigs before weaning and prevented an increase in salivary 
      cortisol concentration immediately after transport and a decrease in meat pH 45 
      min postmortem at the age of 6 mo. Minimal enrichment of the commercial farrowing 
      crate did not affect behavior and physiological measures in pigs before and after 
      weaning.

AB  - This study addressed the impact of early and later life environmental enrichment, 
      and their combination, on specific antibody responses and peripheral blood 
      leukocyte subpopulations in pigs. Pigs were kept in either barren (B1) or 
      enriched (E1) housing from birth, and half of the pigs switched to barren or 
      enriched housing on day 47, resulting in four treatment combinations: B1B2, B1E2, 
      E1B2, E1E2). Pigs were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated 
      trinitrophenyl (KLH-TNP) on day 74 and 109 to induce primary and secondary 
      antibody responses. Blood samples were taken weekly until day 130, and IgM and 
      IgG antibody responses were measured. Leukocyte subpopulations were measured on 
      day 74 and 130. Time course of the antibody responses was not affected by 
      housing. Early life enrichment increased the IgG response to KLH, particularly 
      the primary one. At day 74 the relative frequency of lymphocytes, DC and SLA-II 
      expression on monocytes were higher in E1 pigs, whereas the percentage of 
      granulocytes tended to be lower in E1 pigs at day 74. Early life enrichment 
      increased the SLA-II expression on monocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte 
      ratio, and tended to increase the percentage of granulocytes, but tended to 
      decrease the percentage of monocytes at day 130. Later life enrichment reduced 
      percentages of CD4+CD8α(+) T cells before and after immunization and the SLA-II 
      expression on monocytes at day 74, the percentage of granulocytes and the 
      granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio at day 130. Notably, early and later life housing 
      interacted in their effects on several immune parameters. KLH-IgM responses (both 
      primary and secondary) were affected by the interaction between early and later 
      life housing. IgM titers were higher for B1B2 than for E1E2, with the switched 
      animals (B1E2 and E1B2) moving towards the titers of the animals kept in their 
      later life environment from birth onwards. At day 130 the percentage of gamma 
      delta T cells, CD8α(+) cytotoxic T cells and DC were not different between pigs 
      kept in B1B2 and E1E2, but there was a clear impact of the switch in housing 
      conditions, particularly for the pigs that changed from barren to enriched 
      housing. We also found effects of coping style (personality) and sex on some 
      immune parameters. In conclusion, both early life and later life enrichment, and, 
      notably a switch in housing conditions influenced specific antibodies and 
      leukocyte subpopulations in pigs. The current study implies that the early life 
      history of animals and the (mis)match with their current environment could thus 
      be of major importance for their immune system. Further research is needed to 
      investigate potential consequences for the pigs' health.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has shown remarkable effects in improving cognition 
      and addictive behaviour. We tested whether EE could help recover from prenatal 
      stress exposure. Mature Swiss Webster male and virgin female mice were placed 
      together until vaginal plugs were detectable. Next, pregnant rodents were 
      randomized into the control, physically and psychologically stressed groups. The 
      application of stress was initiated on the 10th day of pregnancy and persisted 
      for a week to induce stress in the mice. Open field and elevated plus-maze (EPM) 
      tests were utilized as explorative and anxiety assays, respectively. A passive 
      avoidance shuttle-box test was carried out to check anxiety-modulated behaviour. 
      Morris water maze (MWM) test was undertaken to evaluate spatial learning and 
      memory. Conditioned place preference (CPP) test was selected for evaluation of 
      tendency to morphine consumption. Our results showed that prenatal stress 
      elevated anxiety-like behaviour in the offspring which EE could significantly 
      alleviate after weaning. We also found a higher preference for morphine use in 
      the physical stress and psychological stress offspring group. However, no 
      difference was observed among the genders. Application of EE for the stress group 
      improved several parameters of the cognitive behaviour significantly. Although 
      prenatal stress can lead to detrimental behavioural and cognitive outcomes, it 
      can in part be relieved by early exposure to EE. However, some outcomes linked to 
      prenatal stress exposure may not be diminished by EE therapy. In light of such 
      irreversible effects, large-scale preventive actions promoting avoidance from 
      stress during pregnancy should be advised.

AB  - Environmental enrichment can modulate mild and chronic stress, responses to 
      anxiogenic stimuli as well as drug vulnerability in a number of animal models. 
      The current study was designed to examine the impact of postnatal environmental 
      enrichment on selectively bred 4th generation high- (HAn) and low-anxiety (LAn) 
      male rats. After weaning, animals were placed in isolated (IE), social (SE) and 
      enriched environments (EE) (e.g., toys, wheels, ropes, changed weekly). We 
      measured anxiety-like behavior (ALB) on the elevated plus maze (EPM; trial 1 at 
      postnatal day (PND) 46, trial 2 at PND 63), amphetamine (AMPH) (0.5mg/kg, 
      IP)-induced locomotor behavior, basal and post anxiogenic stimuli changes in (1) 
      plasma corticosterone, (2) blood pressure and (3) core body temperature. 
      Initially, animals showed consistent trait differences on EPM with HAn showing 
      more ALB but after 40 days in select housing, HAn rats reared in an EE showed 
      less ALB and diminished AMPH-induced activity compared to HAn animals housed in 
      IE and SE. In the physiological tests, animals housed in EE showed elevated 
      adrenocortical responses to forced novel object exposure but decreased body 
      temperature and blood pressure changes after an air puff stressor. All animals 
      reared in EE and SE had elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      (BDNF)-positive cells in the central amygdala (CeA), CA1 and CA2 hippocampal 
      regions and the caudate putamen, but these differences were most pronounced in 
      HAn rats for CeA, CA1 and CA2. Overall, these findings suggest that environmental 
      enrichment offers benefits for trait anxiety rats including a reduction in 
      behavioral and physiological responses to anxiogenic stimuli and AMPH 
      sensitivity, and these responses correlate with changes in BDNF expression in the 
      central amygdala, hippocampus and the caudate putamen.

TI  - The emotional impact of disrupted environmental contexts: Enrichment loss and 
      coping profiles influence stress response recovery in Long-Evans rats.

AB  - With increasing rates of anxiety and mood disorders across the world, there is an 
      unprecedented need for preclinical animal models to generate translational 
      results for humans experiencing disruptive emotional symptoms. Considering that 
      life events resulting in a perception of loss are correlated with depressive 
      symptoms, the enrichment-loss rodent model offers promise as a translational 
      model for stress-initiated psychiatric disorders. Additionally, predisposed 
      temperament characteristics such as coping styles have been found to influence an 
      individual's stress response. Accordingly, male rats were profiled as either 
      consistent or flexible copers and assigned to one of three environments: standard 
      laboratory housing, enriched environment, or enriched environment exposure 
      followed by downsizing to standard laboratory cages (i.e., enrichment-loss 
      group). Throughout the study, several behaviors were assessed to determine 
      stress, social, and reward-processing responses. To assess recovery of the stress 
      response, fecal samples were collected following the swim stress in 3-h 
      increments to determine the recovery trajectory of corticosterone (CORT) and 
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) metabolite levels. Upon death, neural markers of 
      neuroplasticity including doublecortin, glial fibrillary acidic factor, and 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor were assessed via immunohistochemistry. Results 
      indicated the flexible coping animals in the continuous enriched group had higher 
      DHEA/CORT ratios (consistent with adaptive responses in past research); 
      furthermore, the enrichment-loss animals exhibited a blunted CORT response 
      throughout the assessments and enriched flexible copers had faster CORT recovery 
      rates than consistent copers. Standard housed animals exhibited less exploratory 
      behavior in the open field task and continuous enriched, flexible rats consumed 
      more food rewards than the other groups. No differences in neuroplasticity neural 
      markers were observed. In sum, the results of the present study support past 
      research indicating the disruptive consequences of enrichment-loss, providing 
      evidence that the model represents a valuable approach for the investigation of 
      neurobiological mechanisms contributing to interindividual variability in 
      responses to changing experiential landscapes.

TI  - How early experience matters in intellectual development in the case of poverty.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Experiments with rodents indicate that severe early psychological and social 
      deprivation has lasting detrimental effects on learning ability that are not 
      remedied by exposure to enriching experiences in adulthood. Findings indicate 
      that environmental adversity early in life works to limit the development of 
      intelligence with consequences for later functioning. Animal experiments are best 
      viewed as supplying a rationale for early intervention in disadvantaged infants 
      and children who would otherwise be likely to evince low intellectual 
      capabilities later in life. Animal experiments conducted to date do not support 
      an interpretation that early enrichment necessarily boosts later intellectual 
      performance beyond the normal or species-typical range. They indicate that early 
      intervention promotes normative development by preventing adverse early rearing 
      conditions from leading to negative consequences for cognitive ability and 
      self-regulation. The Abecedarian Project, an early enrichment intervention with 
      infants from economically deprived backgrounds, is presented as an example of how 
      early experience matters in terms of human intellectual development in 
      disadvantaged populations. The results of that program reflect what one would 
      expect from the rodent studies mentioned above.

TI  - Psychopathology in great apes: concepts, treatment options and possible 
      homologies to human psychiatric disorders.
PG  - 1246-59
AB  - Many captive great apes show gross behavioral abnormalities such as stereotypies, 
      self-mutilation, inappropriate aggression, fear or withdrawal, which impede 
      attempts to integrate these animals in existing or new social groups. These 
      abnormal behaviors resemble symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in 
      humans such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and 
      post-traumatic stress disorder. Due to the outstanding importance of social 
      interaction and the prolonged period of infantile and juvenile dependence, early 
      separation of infants from their mothers and other adverse rearing conditions, 
      solitary housing, and sensory deprivation are among the major albeit non-specific 
      sources of psychopathology in apes. In contrast to the wealth of research in 
      monkeys, psychopathology in apes has been under-studied, and only a few studies 
      have examined how to alleviate abnormal behavior in captive apes. Recent studies 
      have shown that the enrichment of living conditions and behavioral treatment 
      (conditioning) may ameliorate some pathological features, and careful 
      familiarization with novel physical and social environments can help re-socialize 
      behaviorally disturbed animals, but usually not to the extent of successful 
      mating and raising offspring. The possibility of psychopharmacological treatment 
      of the most severe disturbed animal patients has only been reluctantly 
      considered, but a few case reports have revealed encouraging results. This 
      article proposes the need to expand research into ape psychopathology, which 
      would require an essentially interdisciplinary approach of primatology and 
      psychiatry, ultimately to the benefit of both.

      stress-induced cognitive and behavioral alterations in male rats: behavioral and

PG  - 1860-1871
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2021.1909205 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to chronic stress has detrimental effects on cognitive and 
      emotional processing. Also, the neuroprotective influences of environmental 
      enrichment (EE) and royal jelly (RJ) have been indicated in previous studies. 
      AIMS: To our knowledge, to date, there are no studies about the synergistic 
      effects of EE and RJ on cognitive changes induced by stress. Therefore, this 
      study aimed to investigate the protective effects of RJ, and EE on anxiety-like 
      behaviors, cognitive functions, and expression of hippocampal and also prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in stressed rats. 
      METHODS: By using restraint and cold temperature, rats were exposed to stressful 
      situations and then subjected to treatment with RJ or/ and EE for 14 days. Stress 
      induction was done 14 days before treatments by placing the rats in the 
      restrainer under 4°C. Following the interventions, anxiety-like behaviors, novel 
      object recognition memory (NORM), inhibitive avoidance performance, hippocampal, 
      and PFC BDNF expression were examined. The plasma corticosterone level of all 
      groups was also evaluated. RESULTS: Results showed increased plasma 
      corticosterone levels, stress-induced deficits in the NORM and IA tests, and 
      increased anxiety-like behaviors. EE and RJ improved these deficits with a 
      decline in serum corticosterone and also increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus 
      and PFC in stressed ones. CONCLUSION: The EE and the RJ prevented the detrimental 
      effects of stress on anxiety-like behaviors and memory processes. These 
      treatments can protect susceptible brain areas against chronic stress via 
      improvement in behavioral and cognitive impairments through mediating BDNF 
      expression.

AB  - Either pre- or post-natal environmental factors seem to play a key role in brain 
      and behavioral development and to exert long-term effects. Increasing evidence 
      suggests that exposure to prenatal stress (PS) leads to motor and learning 
      deficits and elevated anxiety, while enriched environment (EE) shows protective 
      effects. The dopaminergic system is also sensitive to environmental life 
      circumstances and affects attention functioning, which serves as the preliminary 
      gate to cognitive processes. However, the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on the 
      dopaminergic system and attentional functioning, in the context of these life 
      experiences, remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of EE or 
      PS on distinct types of attention, along with possible effects of MPH exposure. 
      We found that PS impaired selective attention as well as partial sustained 
      attention, while EE had beneficial effects. Both EE and MPH ameliorated the 
      deleterious effects of PS on attention functioning. Considering the possible 
      psychostimulant effect of MPH, we examined both anxiety-like behavior as well as 
      motor learning. We found that PS had a clear anxiogenic effect, whereas EE had an 
      anxiolytic effect. Nevertheless, the treatment with both MPH and/or EE recovered 
      the deleterious effects of PS. In the motor-learning task, the PS group showed 
      superior performance while MPH led to impaired motor learning. Performance 
      decrements were prevented in both the PS + MPH and EE + MPH groups. This study 
      provides evidence that peripubertal exposure to EE (by providing enhanced 
      sensory, motor, and social opportunities) or MPH treatments might be an optional 
      therapeutic intervention in preventing the PS long-term adverse consequences.

AB  - Both social and physical stimuli contribute to the complexity of an animal's 
      environment, influencing biobehavioral responses to subsequent challenges. In the 
      current study, male Long-Evans rats were randomly assigned to an isolate (ISO), 
      social control (SC) or social enriched (SE) group (n = 8 per group). The SC and 
      SE conditions were group housed with the SE group exposed to physical enrichment 
      stimuli that were natural as opposed to manufactured (e.g., hollowed out log 
      instead of plastic hiding place). On three occasions during their 40-day enriched 
      environment exposure, night/dark phase videos were obtained for 1 h during the 
      early part of the dark phase. During this time, the SE animals exhibited 
      significantly more social grooming with no differences between the SE and SC in 
      the frequency of play or self-grooming bouts. Subsequently, all animals were 
      assessed in social interaction and problem-solving escape tasks during the last 
      week of the enriched environment exposure. SE rats exhibited increased digging 
      bouts toward the restrained conspecific in the social interaction task whereas 
      the other groups exhibited more escape responses. In the problem-solving task, SE 
      animals exhibited a decreased latency to cross the barrier to escape from the 
      predator odor (i.e., cat urine and fur). Neural analyses indicated increased 
      oxytocin-immunoreactive (OT-ir) tissue in the SE supraoptic and paraventricular 
      nuclei of the hypothalamus compared to the other groups. Interestingly, blood 
      samples indicated lower peripheral corticosterone (CORT) and higher OT levels in 
      the ISO animals when compared to the SC and SE animals, an effect retrospectively 
      attributed to separation anxiety in the SE and SC animals in preparation for 
      histology procedures. When the behavioral, neural and endocrine data were 
      visualized as a multifaceted dataset via a multidimensional scaling analysis, 
      however, an association between social enrichment and higher OT involvement was 
      observed in the SE animals, as well as heightened stress responsivity in the ISO 
      and SC groups. In sum, the SE animals exhibited a facilitation of social 
      responses, problem-solving ability and OT immunoreactive responsiveness. These 
      findings provide new information about the influences of both physical and social 
      stimuli in dynamic and enriched environments.

TI  - Sign Tracking in an Enriched Environment: A Potential Ecologically Relevant 
      Animal Model of Adaptive Behavior Change.
PG  - 703-721
LID - 10.3758/s13415-021-00897-7 [doi]
AB  - When an object conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with a food unconditioned 
      stimulus (US), anticipatory goal-directed action directed at the US location 
      (goal tracking) is accompanied by behavior directed at the object CS (sign 
      tracking). Sign-tracking behavior appears to be compulsive and habit-like and 
      predicts increased vulnerability to the addictive potential of drugs in animal 
      models. A large body of the literature also suggests that environmental 
      enrichment protects against the development of addiction-prone phenotypes. Thus, 
      we investigated whether compulsive-like sign tracking develops in environmentally 
      enriched rats trained directly in their enriched home environment. We demonstrate 
      that adolescent enriched-housed male Sprague-Dawley rats readily sign track a 5% 
      ethanol bottle CS in their home environment and at a rate higher than adolescent 
      standard-housed rats. We also show that enriched adolescent rats sign track less 
      than enriched adult-trained rats and that acute isolation stress affects sign- 
      and goal-tracking performance of adolescents and adults differently. Sign 
      tracking increased more in the adult than the adolescent rats. Whereas the 
      younger rats showed a decrease in goal tacking after the final stressor 
      manipulation, the adults showed increased goal tracking. Our results are 
      consistent with recent studies, which suggest that although sign tracking 
      performance is compulsive-like, it is not as inflexible and habit-like as 
      previously assumed. Testing in an enriched home environment with object CSs 
      having greater affordance than "neutral" lever CSs may provide greater ecological 
      relevance for investigating the development and expression of adaptive and 
      compulsive-like behaviors in translational research.

TI  - The Behavioral Effects of Single Housing and Environmental Enrichment on Adult 
      Zebrafish (Danio rerio).
PG  - 280-5
AB  - Environmental enrichment provides laboratory-housed species the opportunity to 
      express natural behavior and exert control over their home environment, thereby 
      minimizing stress. We sought to determine whether providing an artificial plant 
      in the holding tank as enrichment influenced anxiety-like behaviors and 
      place-preference choice in adult zebrafish. Fish were housed singly or in social 
      groups of 5 for 3 wk in 1 of 4 experimental housing environments: single-housed 
      enriched (n = 30), single-housed barren (n = 30), group-housed enriched (n = 30), 
      and group-housed barren (n = 30). On week 4, individual fish were selected 
      randomly from each of the experimental housing environments and tested by using 
      novel-tank, light-dark, and place-preference tests. Housing fish singly in a 
      barren environment increased anxiety-like behaviors in the novel-tank and 
      light-dark behavioral tests. Single-housed zebrafish in barren tanks as well as 
      zebrafish group-housed with conspecifics, both with and without plant enrichment, 
      spent more time associating with conspecifics than with the artificial plant 
      enrichment device during the place-preference test. Single-housed fish maintained 
      in enriched tanks displayed no preference between a compartment with conspecifics 
      or an artificial plant. Our results suggest the addition of an artificial plant 
      as enrichment may benefit single-housed zebrafish when social housing is not 
      possible.

TI  - Environmental enrichment modulates the response to chronic stress in zebrafish.

LID - 10.1242/jeb.176735 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have shown that manipulations to the housing environment modulate 
      susceptibility to stress in laboratory animals, mainly in rodents. Environmental 
      enrichment (EE) is one such manipulation that promotes neuroprotection and 
      neurogenesis, besides affecting behaviors such as drug self-administration. 
      Zebrafish are a popular and useful animal model for behavioral neuroscience 
      studies; however, studies evaluating the impact of housing conditions in this 
      species are scarce. In this study, we verified the effects of EE on behavioral 
      (novel tank test) and biochemical [cortisol and reactive oxygen species (ROS)] 
      parameters in zebrafish submitted to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). 
      Consistent with our previous findings, UCS increased anxiety-like behavior, 
      cortisol and ROS levels in zebrafish. EE for 21 or 28 days attenuated the effects 
      induced by UCS on behavior and cortisol, and prevented the effects on ROS levels. 
      Our findings reinforce the idea that EE exerts neuromodulatory effects across 
      species, reducing vulnerability to stress and its biochemical impact. Also, these 
      results indicate that zebrafish is a suitable model animal to study the 
      behavioral effects and neurobiological mechanisms related to EE.

AB  - Animal welfare assessment relies on valid and practical indicators of affect. In 
      mice, the most widely used research vertebrates, lying still with eyes open, 
      inactive-but-awake (IBA) in the home cage, has potential to be one such 
      indicator. IBA is elevated in barren, conventional housing compared with 
      well-resourced, enriched housing, and predicts immobility in Forced Swim Tests, a 
      common measure of 'helplessness' in depression research. In Experiment 1, using 
      females from three strains (C57BL/6, Balb/c and DBA/2), we first replicated past 
      findings, confirming higher levels of IBA in conventional cages and a positive 
      relationship between IBA and helplessness. We then extended this research to 
      three other signs of depression: changes in weight and sleep, and reduced 
      hippocampal volume. Here, IBA positively covaried with body mass index, with 
      sleep in DBA/2s and conventionally housed BALB/cs, and negatively covaried with 
      hippocampal volume in conventionally housed C57BL/6s. In Experiment 2, we sought 
      to refine the phenotype of IBA to improve its accuracy as a welfare indicator. 
      Here, scoring IBA performed in hunched postures appeared to improve its accuracy 
      as an indicator in Balb/c mice. Additional research is now needed to further 
      refine the phenotype of IBA and to confirm whether it reflects states consistent 
      with depression, or instead other underlying poor welfare conditions.

TI  - Poria cocos water-soluble polysaccharide modulates anxiety-like behavior induced 
      by sleep deprivation by regulating the gut dysbiosis, metabolic disorders and 
      TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway.
PG  - 6648-6664
LID - 10.1039/d2fo00811d [doi]
AB  - Poria cocos (P. cocos) has been traditionally used as folk medicine and 
      functional food in China for more than 2000 years. The water-soluble 
      polysaccharide is the main component of P. cocos decoction. The effects and 
      mechanisms of the water-soluble polysaccharide from P. cocos (PCWP) were 
      investigated in chronic sleep deprivation (CSD)-induced anxiety in rats. CSD 
      induced anxiety, gut dysbiosis, and inflammatory responses, and reduced 
      neurotransmitter levels, whereas PCWP intervention ameliorated anxiety-like 
      behaviors, increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, 
      and γ-aminobutyric acid in the hypothalamus, regulated gastrointestinal peptide 
      levels, reduced inflammatory factors, and inhibited the tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF)-α/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway in rats with CSD. The changes in 
      the intestinal flora composition were determined using 16S rDNA sequencing, and 
      indicated that PCWP significantly improved species richness and diversity in the 
      intestinal flora of rats with anxiety, and adjusted the abundance of the 
      following dysregulated bacteria closer to that of the normal group: 
      Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Ruminococcus, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, 
      Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Fusicatenibacter. Metabolomics was used to analyze 
      fecal samples to identify significantly altered metabolites in the PCWP-treated 
      groups. Thirty-eight PCWP-related metabolites and four metabolic pathways such as 
      sphingolipid metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, vitamin B6 
      metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism were explored. The results of 
      serum metabolomics showed that 26 biomarkers were significantly changed after 
      PCWP intervention compared with the model group. The regulatory effects of 
      metabolic pathway enrichment on sphingolipid, phenylalanine, and taurine and 
      hypotaurine metabolism, and validation results showed that PCWP intervention 
      regulated the activity of enzymes involved in the above metabolic pathways. A 
      strong correlation between intestinal bacteria and potential biomarkers was 
      found. Our findings present new evidence supporting the potential effect of PCWP 
      in preventing the progression of anxiety by inhibiting the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling 
      pathway, alleviating metabolic disorders, and ameliorating the gut microflora 
      imbalance.

TI  - Fostering and environmental enrichment ameliorate anxious behavior induced by 
      early weaning in Balb/c mice.
PG  - 318-24
AB  - Postnatal stimuli affect many aspects of physiological and behavioral 
      development. In mice, earlier weaning augments anxiety, putatively as a result of 
      removing mother-pup interactions during the weaning period. Here, we examined the 
      ameliorating effects of social and environmental enrichment on anxiety related to 
      early weaning. Mice weaned at postpartum day 14 were fostered by virgin females, 
      who displayed some nursing behavior during the 1-week fostering period. In 
      elevated plus-maze tests, 10-week-old pups reared with a foster mother spent more 
      time in the open arms than early-weaned mice, and entered into the open arms at a 
      rate between that of normally- and early-weaned mice. Subsequently, the mice from 
      each rearing group were transferred into either standard housing or housing 
      enriched with toys that were changed periodically. Elevated plus-maze tests were 
      conducted again when the mice were 18 and 26 weeks old. The enriched environment 
      increased the duration of time spent in the open arms, but the magnitude of the 
      effect varied with the rearing condition. Furthermore, mice that lived in the 
      enriched environment showed lower activity than those kept in standard housing. 
      These results suggest that fostering after early weaning attenuates increases in 
      anxiety levels, and maternal care during this period may be important in the 
      development of an offspring's emotionality. Environmental stimuli in adulthood 
      may act to blunt the effects deprivation in early life.

TI  - Antidepressant and proneurogenic influence of environmental enrichment in mice: 
      protective effects vs recovery.
PG  - 2460-8
LID - 10.1038/npp.2011.134 [doi]
AB  - Physical-cognitive activity has long-lasting beneficial effects on the brain and 
      on behavior. Environmental enrichment (EE) induces brain activity known to 
      influence the behavior of mice, as measured in learned helplessness paradigms 
      (forced swim test), and neurogenic cell populations in the hippocampal dentate 
      gyrus. However, it is not completely clear whether the antidepressant and 
      proneurogenic effects of EE are different in animals that are naive or 
      pre-exposed to the stress inducing helplessness, and if this depends on the type 
      of stressor. It also remains unclear whether differential effects are exerted on 
      distinct neurogenic subpopulations. We found that EE has a protective effect in 
      adult female mice (C57BL/6J) when exposed twice to the same stressor (forced swim 
      test) but it has no influence on recovery. The repeated exposure to this stressor 
      was analyzed together with the effects of EE on different neurogenic populations 
      distinguished by age and differentiation state. Younger cells are more sensitive 
      and responsive to the conditions, both the positive and negative effects. These 
      results are relevant to identify the cell populations that are the targets of 
      stress, depression, and enrichment, and that form part of the mechanism 
      responsible for mood dysfunctions.

TI  - Dual Profile of Environmental Enrichment and Autistic-Like Behaviors in the 
      Maternal Separated Model in Rats.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22031173 [doi]
LID - 1173
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental Enrichment (EE) has been suggested as a possible 
      therapeutic intervention for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. 
      Although the benefits of this therapeutic method have been reported in some 
      animal models and human studies, the unknown pathophysiology of autism as well as 
      number of conflicting results, urge for further examination of the therapeutic 
      potential of EE in autism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the 
      effects of environmental enrichment on autism-related behaviors which were 
      induced in the maternal separation (MS) animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Maternally separated (post-natal day (PND) 1-14, 3h/day) and control male rats 
      were at weaning (PND21) age equally divided into rats housed in enriched 
      environment and normal environment. At adolescence (PND42-50), the four groups 
      were behaviorally tested for direct social interaction, sociability, repetitive 
      behaviors, anxiety behavior, and locomotion. Following completion of the 
      behavioral tests, the blood and brain tissue samples were harvested in order to 
      assess plasma level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and structural 
      plasticity of brain using ELISA and stereological methods respectively. RESULTS: 
      We found that environmental enrichment reduced repetitive behaviors but failed to 
      improve the impaired sociability and anxiety behaviors which were induced by 
      maternal separation. Indeed, EE exacerbated anxiety and social behaviors deficits 
      in association with increased plasma BDNF level, larger volume of the hippocampus 
      and infra-limbic region and higher number of neurons in the infra-limbic area (p 
      < 0.05). Conclusion: We conclude that environmental enrichment has a significant 
      improvement effect on the repetitive behavior as one of the core autistic-like 
      behaviors induced by maternal separation but has negative effect on the anxiety 
      and social behaviors which might have been modulated by BDNF.

TI  - Leveraging Large-Scale Genetics of PTSD and Cardiovascular Disease to Demonstrate 
      Robust Shared Risk and Improve Risk Prediction Accuracy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are 
      significantly more likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
      (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke). The evidence for this link is so 
      compelling that the National Institutes of Health convened a working group to 
      determine gaps in the literature, including the need for large-scale genomic 
      studies to identify shared genetic risk. The aim of the present study was to 
      address some of these gaps by utilizing PTSD and CVD genome-wide association 
      study (GWAS) summary statistics in a large biobank sample to determine the shared 
      genetic risk of PTSD and CVD. METHODS: A large health care biobank data set was 
      used (N=36,412), combined with GWAS summary statistics from publicly available 
      large-scale PTSD and CVD studies. Disease phenotypes (e.g., PTSD) were collected 
      from electronic health records. De-identified genetic data from the biobank were 
      genotyped using Illumina SNP array. Summary statistics data sets were processed 
      with the following quality-control criteria: 1) SNP heritability h(2) >0.05, 2) 
      compute z-statistics (z=beta/SE or z=log(OR)/SE), 3) filter nonvariable SNPs 
      (0<freq<1), and 4) filter SNPs with low number of samples. The multitrait 
      analysis of GWAS (MTAG) approach was used to combine GWAS summary statistics. 
      RESULTS: Significant genetic correlations were found between PTSD and CVD 
      (r(G)=0.24, SE=0.06), and Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a potential 
      causal link from PTSD to hypertension (β=0.20, SE=0.04), but not the reverse. 
      PTSD summary statistics significantly predicted PTSD diagnostic status 
      (R(2)=0.27), and this was significantly improved by incorporating summary 
      statistics from CVD and major depressive disorder (R(2)=1.30). Further, pathway 
      enrichment analyses indicated that genetic variants involved in shared PTSD-CVD 
      risk included those involved in postsynaptic structure, synapse organization, and 
      interleukin-7-mediated signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this 
      study suggest that PTSD and CVD may share genetic risk. Further, these results 
      implicate PTSD as a risk factor leading to the development of hypertension and 
      coronary artery disease. Additional research is needed to determine the clinical 
      utility of these findings.

TI  - Pharmahuasca and DMT Rescue ROS Production and Differentially Expressed Genes 
      Observed after Predator and Psychosocial Stress: Relevance to Human PTSD.
PG  - 257-274
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00660 [doi]
AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with cognitive deficits, 
      oxidative stress, and inflammation. Animal models have recapitulated features of 
      PTSD, but no comparative RNA sequencing analysis of differentially expressed 
      genes (DEGs) in the brain between PTSD and animal models of traumatic stress has 
      been carried out. We compared DEGs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of an 
      established stress model to DEGs from the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) of humans. We 
      observed a significant enrichment of rat DEGs in human PTSD and identified 20 
      overlapping DEGs, of which 17 (85%) are directionally concordant. 
      N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a known indirect antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
      and neuroprotective compound with antidepressant and plasticity-facilitating 
      effects. We tested the capacity of DMT, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) 
      harmaline, and "pharmahuasca" (DMT + harmaline) to reduce reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) production and inflammatory gene expression and to modulate 
      neuroplasticity-related gene expression in the model. We administered DMT (2 
      mg/kg IP), harmaline (1.5 mg/kg IP), pharmahuasca, or vehicle every other day for 
      5 days, following a 30 day stress regiment. We measured ROS production in the PFC 
      and hippocampus (HC) by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and 
      sequenced total mRNA in the PFC. We also performed in vitro assays to measure the 
      affinity and efficacy of DMT and harmaline at 5HT(2A)R compared to 5-HT. DMT and 
      pharmahuasca reduced ROS production in the PFC and HC, while harmaline had mixed 
      effects. Treatments normalized 9, 12, and 14 overlapping DEGs, and pathway 
      analysis implicated that genes were involved in ROS production, inflammation, 
      growth factor signaling, neurotransmission, and neuroplasticity.

TI  - Region-dependent and stage-specific effects of stress, environmental enrichment, 
      and antidepressant treatment on hippocampal neurogenesis.
PG  - 797-811
LID - 10.1002/hipo.22134 [doi]
AB  - Chronic stress and depression are associated with decreased levels of hippocampal 
      neurogenesis. On the other hand, antidepressants as well as environmental 
      enrichment may rely in part on their pro-neurogenic effects to improve cognition 
      and mood. Because a functional heterogeneity has been consistently reported along 
      the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, regional changes in neurogenesis 
      could differentially contribute to these effects and affect distinct hippocampal 
      functions. Mapping these regional changes could therefore provide a better 
      understanding of the function of newborn neurons. While some studies report 
      region-specific effects of stress and antidepressants on neurogenesis, it is 
      unclear whether these changes affect distinct populations of newborn neurons 
      according to their developmental stage in a region-specific manner. By using 
      endogenous markers and BrdU labeling we quantified the regional changes in cell 
      proliferation and survival as well as in the number of neuronal progenitors and 
      immature neurons following unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), 
      environmental enrichment (EE) and chronic fluoxetine (20 mg/kg/day) treatment 
      along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. EE promoted cell proliferation 
      and survival of 4-week-old newborn cells as well as increased the number and 
      proportion of post-mitotic immature neurons specifically within the septal 
      hippocampus. By contrast, UCMS uniformly decreased cell proliferation, survival 
      and immature newborn neurons but differentially affected progenitor cells with a 
      decrease restricted to the temporal regions of the hippocampus. Whereas 
      fluoxetine treatment in control mice affected proliferation and survival 
      specifically in the temporal hippocampus, it reversed most of the UCMS-induced 
      alterations all along the septo-temporal axis. These results highlight that 
      different factors known for exerting a mood improving effect differentially 
      regulate neurogenesis along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. Such 
      region and stage specific effects may correlate to distinct functional properties 
      of newborn neurons along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus which may 
      contribute differently to the pathophysiology of affective disorders.

AB  - While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after exposure to severe 
      traumatic events, data have shown that individuals with high sensation-seeking 
      personality traits are less prone to developing PTSD. The current study used the 
      rodent environmental enrichment preclinical model of sensation-seeking to 
      determine if similar sensation seeking effects in animal models of PTSD-like 
      behaviors were found. The study also attempted to determine whether environmental 
      enrichment altered the effects of midazolam on these PTSD-like behaviors. Male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were received at postnatal day (PND) 21 and placed into 
      either an enriched (EC), isolated (IC), or social (SC) condition. Beginning on 
      PND 51, the animals underwent 3 fear conditioning trials where a tone was paired 
      with a 2 s 0.7 mA footshock. Twenty-four hours later, rats were given 15-min i.p. 
      pretreatments of 0, 0.5, or 1.5 mg/kg midazolam, before being placed into fear 
      conditioning chambers for a test of expression of conditioned fear response in a 
      novel context. Following fear conditioning, rodents were also tested in the 
      elevated plus maze (EPM) and the forced swim task (FST) following pretreatments 
      of midazolam. Results from fear conditioning indicated IC rats showed a 
      significant decrease in freezing during acquisition compared to EC and SC rats. 
      Also, during expression, IC rats had lower freezing following saline injections 
      and 0.5 mg/kg midazolam but were equal in time freezing to EC and SC rats 
      following 1.5 mg/kg midazolam. In the EPM there were no effects of midazolam and 
      IC rats showed decreased time spent in the open arms compared to EC and SC rats. 
      In FST, IC rats spent less time immobile and more time swimming compared to EC 
      and SC rats. Overall, results suggest that the rodent environmental enrichment 
      model of sensation-seeking seems to parallel the effects of sensation-seeking on 
      likelihood of PTSD symptoms seen in humans.

TI  - Environmental enrichment delays pup-induced maternal behavior in rats.
PG  - 371-82
LID - 10.1002/dev.20526 [doi]
AB  - Adult, virgin rats do not spontaneously display maternal behavior when exposed to 
      foster pups. However, continuous daily exposure of the female to foster pups for 
      about 5-7 days can induce a set of maternal behaviors similar to those shown by 
      postpartum dams. Induction latencies depend upon a number of factors, including 
      the stress and anxiety levels of the female. The goal of this study was to 
      attempt to mitigate the likely stressfulness of being singly housed during 
      testing by enriching the rat's home cage environment and to determine if the 
      concomitant environmental change would alter the latency to express maternal 
      behavior. In addition, the effect of varying the number of test pups used for 
      testing was examined. Two groups of virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were first tested 
      on the elevated plus maze after 1 week of exposure to either control (standard 
      housing) or enriched conditions. One week later, maternal behavior testing began 
      using one or three pups. Upon completion of maternal behavior testing, plasma 
      corticosterone concentrations were determined following a mild stressor. The data 
      indicate that enrichment tends to increase anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated 
      plus maze. In addition, enrichment delayed the onset of maternal behavior 
      irrespective of the number of test pups. There were no effects of environmental 
      enrichment on plasma corticosterone levels following exposure to a stressor. 
      These results indicate that what is considered a modestly enriched environment 
      delays the expression of pup-oriented responses and does not apparently reduce 
      stress or improve performance on all behavioral tasks.

AB  - We used the inescapable foot shock paradigm (IFS) in rats as an animal model for 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previously we showed that exercise 
      reversed the enhanced stress sensitivity induced by IFS. From literature it is 
      known that food restriction has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Since both 
      treatments influence energy expenditure, we questioned whether food restriction 
      reduces anxiety in the IFS model via a comparable, NPY dependent mechanism as 
      enrichment. Anxiety of IFS-exposed animals was measured as change in locomotion 
      and freezing after sudden silence in an open field test, before and after two 
      weeks of food restriction. In addition a forced swim test (FST) was performed. 
      Next, using qPCR, the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the neuropeptide Y1 
      receptor (Y1 receptor) was measured in the amygdala. Food restriction increased 
      locomotion and decreased freezing behavior both in control and IFS animals. These 
      effects were small. IFS-induced anxiety was not abolished after two weeks of food 
      restriction. IFS did not influence immobility or the duration of swimming in the 
      FST of animals fed ad libitum. However, food restriction increased swimming and 
      decreased the duration of immobility in IFS-exposed animals. Y1 receptor 
      expression in the basolateral amygdala decreased after both IFS and food 
      restriction. Although food restriction seems to induce a general anxiolytic 
      effect, it does not operate via enhanced Y1 receptor expression and has no effect 
      on the more pathogenic anxiety induced by IFS.

TI  - Norepinephrine exposure restrains endometrial decidualization during early 
      pregnancy.
PG  - 277-288

LID - 10.1530/JOE-20-0479 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have focused on the role of norepinephrine on arrhythmias, 
      generalized anxiety disorder, and cancer. This study aimed to investigate the 
      effect of norepinephrine on endometrial decidualization. Artificial 
      decidualization and norepinephrine-treated mice were established in vivo. In 
      vitro, human endometrial stromal cells were treated with MPA and cAMP to induce 
      decidualization. Decidual markers and important signaling molecules during 
      decidualization were detected using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. 
      RNA sequencing was performed to determine related signaling pathways. Exposure to 
      excess norepinephrine significantly restricted the induced expression of 
      decidualized markers Dtprp, BMP2, WNT4, and Hand2 in mice. In vitro, 10 µM 
      norepinephrine markedly downregulated the expressions of prolactin, IGFBP1, and 
      PLZF, which are the specifical markers of decidual stromal cells during 
      decidualization. The gene set enrichment analysis showed a significant enrichment 
      in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions of norepinephrine treatment group. 
      The α1b-adrenergic receptor expression was upregulated by norepinephrine. 
      Interestingly, norepinephrine did not inhibit the expression of IGFBP1 in 
      endometrial stromal cells after silencing α1b-adrenergic receptor, while 
      significantly suppressed the induced decidualization with overexpression of 
      α1b-adrenergic receptor. When α1b-adrenergic receptor was activated, endometrial 
      p-PKC was significantly increased under post-treatment with norepinephrine in 
      vivo and in vitro. In addition, norepinephrine treatment inhibited embryo and 
      fetal development using a normal pregnancy model. Therefore, norepinephrine 
      exposure inhibited endometrial decidualization through the activation of the PKC 
      signaling pathway by upregulating α1b-adrenergic receptor. Our study could 
      explain some female reproductive problems due to stress and provide some novel 
      strategies for this disorder.

TI  - Beyond "Doing Better": Ordinal Rating Scales to Monitor Behavioural Indicators of 
      Well-Being in Cats.
LID - 10.3390/ani12212897 [doi]
LID - 2897
AB  - Safeguarding the well-being of cats is essential to the mission of any 
      responsible animal shelter. Environmental enrichment and behaviour modification 
      are often key to this goal. Measuring response to these interventions is 
      essential to ensure strategies are successful. There are often many staff and 
      volunteers involved in these efforts, and a lack of standardised language can 
      make monitoring progress difficult. Ordinal rating scales of key behaviours can 
      be a useful way to summarise observations and ensure that common language is 
      used. However, it is crucial that these scales have good interobserver agreement 
      and reliability, so operational definitions and training systems are important. 
      This paper presents a method for evaluating four different expressions of cat 
      welfare on a 0-5 scale: modified Fear, Anxiety, and Stress score; Response to 
      Petting score; Participation in Play score; and Food Intake Summary score. All 
      scales showed almost perfect average interobserver agreement (linear weighted κ) 
      and excellent average interobserver reliability (interclass correlation 
      coefficient). These scales may prove useful to other shelters, or any other 
      environment where evaluating response to interventions is important to the 
      welfare of cats, such as research facilities or home environments. The 
      exceptional interobserver agreement and reliability of this study compared with 
      some others highlights the importance of standardised training programs.

TI  - Maternal presence and environmental enrichment affect food neophobia of piglets.
PG  - 19-22
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0430 [doi]
AB  - Young omnivores show food neophobia in order to avoid the potential harmful 
      effects of ingesting unfamiliar food items. We investigated whether the presence 
      of the mother and an enriched rearing environment would reduce food neophobia in 
      piglets. A mother may provide information on suitable food types to include in 
      the diet, whereas an enriched environment may stimulate behavioural development 
      and reduce reactivity towards novel stimuli (including food). Five barren-reared 
      or enriched-reared piglets per litter were exposed to two novel food items in the 
      presence, and the other five per litter in the absence, of the mother in a 7 min 
      test. Maternal presence reduced food neophobia profoundly as reflected in a 
      reduced latency to touching the food, a higher proportion of piglets sampling the 
      two different food items and a higher intake. Latency to touch the food, however, 
      was affected by maternal presence more strongly for barren-reared piglets than 
      for enriched-reared piglets, and in the absence of the sow, consumption of one 
      novel food type and time spent in the feeding area were higher for 
      enriched-reared piglets. Environmental enrichment does have the potential to 
      reduce food neophobia, but the presence of the mother during the encounter with 
      novel food seems more efficient in decreasing food neophobia of piglets.

TI  - Influence of Housing Systems on Physical, Emotional, and Cognitive Functions with 
      Aging in DBA/2CrSlc Mice.

AB  - Environmental conditions, including enrichment and stress, affect animal 
      behaviors, but limited information is available regarding the differences in 
      animal functions between the chamber (ventilated system) vs. IVC (individually 
      ventilated cages) housing systems. Therefore, the effects of different housing 
      systems were examined on physical, emotional, and cognitive functions and the 
      intestinal flora with aging. DBA/2CrSlc mice were divided into chamber and IVC 
      groups. Differences in the structure of the two cages considered whether the 
      mouse could dangle or not. Physical, emotional, and cognitive functions were 
      examined using the open field, black and white box, object recognition, 
      horizontal bar, wire hanging, balancing, footprint, and locomotor tests. The IVC 
      group demonstrated significantly less food intake, higher body weight (by 
      approximately 5 g), lower rectal core temperature, less muscle and balancing 
      powers with aging, and fewer anxiety-like behaviors than the chamber group. No 
      differences were observed in the cognitive function and intestinal microbiota 
      between the groups. The housing environment affected the rodent basal temperature 
      and body weight as well as the physical and emotional functions. Scientists 
      should be attentive to the type of cages used in the housing system for an 
      experiment, especially when comparing the results with animals reared in 
      different systems.

AB  - In an open-field test, the Long-Evans (LE) strain of rats was identified as 
      "bold" and the PVG strain as "shy." Some members of each strain then experienced 
      14 sessions of a common enrichment procedure, namely exposure to a series of 
      novel objects (Exposed). Others in each strain were explicitly reinforced with 
      food pellets for variable interactions with the same objects (Reinforced). Both 
      experience and strain influenced object interactions. In particular, Reinforced 
      rats interacted more variably with the objects - contacting, probing, pushing and 
      so forth - than did the Exposed; and LEs interacted more variably than PVGs. 
      Foraging proficiency in the same rats was then studied in a transfer-of-training 
      test. Food pellets were hidden among never-before experienced objects and the 
      rats were permitted to explore freely. Reinforced rats discovered and consumed 
      more pellets than Exposed; and LEs discovered and consumed more than PVGs. Thus a 
      bold genetic strain and reinforcement of variability independently contributed to 
      successful foraging behavior.

TI  - Environmental enrichment in mice decreases anxiety, attenuates stress responses 
      and enhances natural killer cell activity.
PG  - 1341-7
AB  - The importance of environment in the regulation of brain, behaviour and 
      physiology has long been recognized in biological, social and medical sciences. 
      Animals maintained under enriched conditions have clearly been shown to have 
      better learning abilities than those maintained under standard conditions. 
      However, the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on immunity and 
      emotionality have been less documented and remain questionable. Therefore, we 
      investigated the effect of EE on natural killer (NK) cell activity, psychological 
      stress responses and behavioural parameters. Male C3H mice were housed either in 
      enriched or standard conditions for 6 weeks. Behaviour was then examined by the 
      grip-strength test, staircase and elevated plus maze, and corticosterone levels 
      and NK cell activity were measured. Furthermore, animals exposed to the stress 
      paradigm, achieved by electric shock with reminders, were tested for freezing 
      time in each reminder. Corticosterone levels were also measured. The EE mice 
      showed decreased anxiety-like behaviour and higher activity compared to standard 
      mice, as revealed by a greater percentage of time spent in the open arms of the 
      elevated plus maze, and a higher rate of climbing the staircase. A shorter 
      freezing time in the stress paradigm and no corticosterone level reactivity were 
      measured in EE mice. In addition, NK cell activity in spleens of EE mice was 
      higher than that demonstrated in those of standard mice. Thus, EE has a 
      beneficial effect on anxiety-like behaviour, stress response and NK cell 
      activity. The effect on NK cell activity is promising, due to the role of NK 
      cells in host resistance.

TI  - Defending and coping in psychically disturbed adolescents. I. Theory, results of 
      factor analysis.
PG  - 232-40
AB  - More recent contributions of a sociologically, development-psychologically or 
      also characterologically orientated psychoanalysis stress the significance of 
      defence and coping mechanisms for psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. 
      Cognitive development psychology and interactional psychopathology point in a 
      similar direction. An empirical analysis of 1008 child and adolescent psychiatric 
      patients went into the question of the relative importance of these dimensions of 
      defence and coping for the diagnosis of these patients. Alongside behaviour 
      disorders and psychopathological symptoms also formal personality attributes, 
      existential themes and existential techniques were recorded. The data was factor 
      analytically reduced. Particularly informative in the existential techniques was 
      a comparison between a factor of coping and several defence factors. The factor 
      analysis of second order confirmed the expectation, according to which a close 
      association of coping and expansion/restriction as a dimension of life world 
      resulted on the one hand and a connection between psychopathology and defence 
      dimensions on the other hand. As a total result, a confirmation of the 
      significance of dimensions of defence and coping for a psychopathology in 
      childhood and adolescence can be recognized. Self strength, lacking impulse 
      control, evasive fear resistance, physical symptoms and signs, narcissistic 
      resistance, fear of achievement, foregoing and misled autonomy present, on a 
      factoral level, a crossing of psychopathology and dimensions of defence and 
      coping and thus an enrichment of psychopathological diagnosis in childhood and 
      adolescence.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is widely used as a promising translational model 
      organism for studying various brain disorders. Zebrafish are also commonly used 
      in behavioral and drug screening assays utilizing individually tested (socially 
      isolated) fish. Various sounds represent important exogenous factors that may 
      affect fish behavior. Mounting evidence shows that musical/auditory environmental 
      enrichment can improve welfare of laboratory animals, including fishes. Here, we 
      show that auditory environmental enrichment mitigates anxiogenic-like effects 
      caused by acute 24-h social isolation in adult zebrafish. Thus, auditory 
      environmental enrichment may offer an inexpensive, feasible and simple tool to 
      improve welfare of zebrafish stocks in laboratory facilities, reduce unwanted 
      procedural stress, lower non-specific behavioral variance and, hence, 
      collectively improve zebrafish data reliability and reproducibility.

      chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression rat model.
PG  - 972351

LID - 972351
AB  - Objectives: Our goals were to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of 
      Yang-Xin-Jie-Yu Decoction (YXJYD) in Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress 
      (CUMS)-induced depression rat model and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. 
      Design: We used CUMS-induced depression rat model to evaluate whether oral 
      administration of YXJYD with different doses (2.1 g/kg, 1.05 g/kg and 0.525 g/kg, 
      respectively) improve the depressive-like symptoms, and then performed 
      UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS to explore the active ingredients of YXJYD. Subsequently, rat's 
      cecal contents, serum, and urine were collected from the control group, CUMS 
      model group, and YXJYD high-dose (2.1 g/kg) treatment group. The 16S rRNA 
      sequencing was performed on the cecal contents, based on Illumina MiSeq platform, 
      and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition variety and screen 
      differential expression of gut bacteria in the three groups. (1)H Nuclear 
      Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis was used for analyzing the metabolites obtained 
      from cecal contents, serum, and urine, and KEGG enrichment analysis was used to 
      identify pathways of differential metabolites. An integrated 16S rRNA sequencing 
      and metabolomic data were conducted to characterize the underlying mechanisms of 
      YXJYD Results: The gut microbial communities, and serum, cecal content, urine 
      metabolic compositions were significantly significantly altered in CUMS-induced 
      depressive rats, while YXJYD effectively ameliorated the CUMS-associated gut 
      microbiota dysbiosis, especially of Monoglobus, and alleviated the disturbance of 
      serum, cecal content, urine metabolome and reversed the changes of key depressive 
      and gut microbiota-related metabolites, such as succinic acid, taurine, hippuric 
      acid, melatonin. With an integrated study of the gut microbiota and metabolomes, 
      we identified the pathway of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and propanoate 
      metabolism as the regulated target of YXJYD on host-microbiome interaction. 
      Conclusion: Our findings further confirmed the imbalance of metabolism and 
      intestinal microbial is closely related to CUMS-induced depression. YXJYD 
      regulates gut microbiome to affect body metabolomes and then produce

TI  - Enriched Environment Attenuates Enhanced Trait Anxiety in Association with 
      Normalization of Aberrant Neuro-Inflammatory Events.

LID - 13052
AB  - Neuroinflammation is discussed to play a role in specific subgroups of different 
      psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders. We have previously shown that 
      a mouse model of trait anxiety (HAB) displays enhanced microglial density and 
      phagocytic activity in key regions of anxiety circuits compared to normal-anxiety 
      controls (NAB). Using minocycline, we provided causal evidence that reducing 
      microglial activation within the dentate gyrus (DG) attenuated enhanced anxiety 
      in HABs. Besides pharmacological intervention, "positive environmental stimuli", 
      which have the advantage of exerting no side-effects, have been shown to modulate 
      inflammation-related markers in human beings. Therefore, we now investigated 
      whether environmental enrichment (EE) would be sufficient to modulate upregulated 
      neuroinflammation in high-anxiety HABs. We show for the first time that EE can 
      indeed attenuate enhanced trait anxiety, even when presented as late as 
      adulthood. We further found that EE-induced anxiolysis was associated with the 
      attenuation of enhanced microglial density (using Iba-1 as the marker) in the DG 
      and medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, EE reduced Iba1 + CD68+ microglia 
      density within the anterior DG. Hence, the successful attenuation of trait 
      anxiety by EE was associated in part with the normalization of neuro-inflammatory 
      imbalances. These results suggest that pharmacological and/or positive behavioral 
      therapies triggering microglia-targeted anti-inflammatory effects could be 
      promising as novel alternatives or complimentary anxiolytic therapeutic 
      approaches in specific subgroups of individuals predisposed to trait anxiety.

AB  - Environmental Enrichment (EE) improves cognitive function and enhances brain 
      plasticity, while chronic stress increases emotionality, impairs learning and 
      memory, and has adverse effects on brain anatomy and biochemistry. We explored 
      the beneficial role of environmental enrichment initiated in adolescence against 
      the negative outcomes of Chronic Unpredictable Stress (CUS) during adulthood on 
      emotional behavior, cognitive function, as well as somatic and neuroendocrine 
      markers in both sexes. Adolescent Wistar rats housed either in enriched or 
      standard housing conditions for 10 weeks. On postnatal day 66, a subgroup from 
      each housing condition was daily exposed to a 4-week stress protocol. Following 
      stress, adult rats underwent behavioral testing to evaluate anxiety, 
      exploration/locomotor activity, depressive-like behavior and spatial 
      learning/memory. Upon completion of behavioral testing, animals were exposed to a 
      10-m stressful event to test the neuroendocrine response to acute stress. CUS 
      decreased body weight gain and increased adrenal weight. Some stress-induced 
      behavioral adverse effects were sex-specific since learning impairments were 
      limited to males while depressive-like behavior to females. EE housing protected 
      against CUS-related behavioral deficits and body weight loss. Exposure to CUS 
      affected the neuroendocrine response of males to acute stress as revealed by the 
      increased corticosterone levels. Our findings highlight the significant role of 
      EE in adolescence as a protective factor against the negative effects of stress 
      and underline the importance of inclusion of both sexes in animal studies.

AB  - The social environment is a major determinant of individual stress response and 
      lifetime health. The present study shows that (1) social enrichment has a 
      significant impact on neuroplasticity and behaviour particularly in females; and 
      (2) social enrichment in females can be transmitted to their unexposed female 
      descendants. Two generations (F0 and F1) of male and female rats raised in 
      standard and social housing conditions were examined for neurohormonal and 
      molecular alterations along with changes in four behavioural modalities. In 
      addition to higher cortical neuronal density and cortical thickness, social 
      experience in mothers reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity 
      in F0 rats and their F1 non-social housing offspring. Only F0 social mothers and 
      their F1 non-social daughters displayed improved novelty-seeking exploratory 
      behaviour and reduced anxiety-related behaviour whereas their motor and cognitive 
      performance remained unchanged. Also, cortical and mRNA measurements in the F1 
      generation were affected by social experience intergenerationally via the female 
      lineage (mother-to-daughter). These findings indicate that social experience 
      promotes cortical neuroplasticity, neurohormonal and behavioural outcomes, and 
      these changes can be transmitted to the F1 non-social offspring in a sexually 
      dimorphic manner. Thus, a socially stimulating environment may form new 
      biobehavioural phenotypes not only in exposed individuals, but also in their 
      intergenerationally programmed descendants.

AB  - The kynurenine (KYN) pathway of tryptophan (TRP) degradation is activated by 
      stress and inflammatory factors. It is now well established that social stress 
      induces the activation of the immune system, with central inflammation and KYN 
      metabolism being two of the main factors linking stress with depression. The aim 
      of the present study was to evaluate the long-lasting changes in the KYN pathway 
      induced by social defeat (SD) associated with the resilience or susceptibility to 
      an increase in the conditioned rewarding effects of cocaine. Mice were exposed to 
      repeated SD and 3 weeks later, a conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by a 
      subthreshold dose of cocaine (1.5 mg/kg) was developed. KYN levels in plasma, 
      cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum and limbic forebrain were studied at the end of 
      the CPP procedure. Changes in the KYN pathway after exposure to pharmacological 
      (oxytocin and indomethacin) and environmental interventions (environmental 
      enrichment) were also evaluated. Our results showed that defeated susceptible 
      (SD-S) mice had higher conditioning scores than resilient mice (SD-R). In 
      addition, although KYN concentration was elevated in all defeated mice, SD-R mice 
      showed smaller increases in KYN concentration in the cerebellum than SD-S mice. 
      Oxytocin or Indomethacin treatment before SD normalized cocaine-induced CPP, 
      although the increase in the KYN pathway was maintained. However, environmental 
      enrichment before SD normalized cocaine-induced CPP and prevented the increase in 
      the KYN pathway. The present study highlights the role of the KYN pathway and 
      anti-inflammatory drugs acting on TRP metabolism as pharmacological targets to 
      potentiate resilience to social stress effects.

TI  - Transcriptional profiles in the mouse amygdala after a cognitive judgment bias 
      test largely depend on the genotype.
PG  - 1025389

AB  - Background: The amygdala is crucial for emotional cognitive processing. Affective 
      or emotional states can bias cognitive processes, including attention, memory, 
      and decision-making. This can result in optimistic or pessimistic behaviors that 
      are partially driven by the activation of the amygdala. The resulting emotional 
      cognitive bias is a common feature of anxiety and mood disorders, both of which 
      are interactively influenced by genetic and environmental factors. It is also 
      known that emotional cognitive biases can be influenced by environmental factors. 
      However, little is known about the effects of genetics and/or gene-environment 
      interactions on emotional cognitive biases. We investigated the effects of the 
      genetic background and environmental enrichment on the transcriptional profiles 
      of the mouse amygdala following a well-established cognitive bias test. Methods: 
      Twenty-four female C57BL/6J and B6D2F1N mice were housed either in standard 
      (control) conditions or in an enriched environment. After appropriate training, 
      the cognitive bias test was performed on 19 mice that satisfactorily completed 
      the training scheme to assess their responses to ambiguous cues. This allowed us 
      to calculate an "optimism score" for each mouse. Subsequently, we dissected the 
      anterior and posterior portions of the amygdala to perform RNA-sequencing for 
      differential expression and other statistical analyses. Results: In general, we 
      found only minor changes in the amygdala's transcriptome associated with the 
      levels of optimism in our mice. In contrast, we observed wide molecular effects 
      of the genetic background in both housing environments. The C57BL/6J animals 
      showed more transcriptional changes in response to enriched environments than the 
      B6D2F1N mice. We also generally found more dysregulated genes in the posterior 
      than in the anterior portion of the amygdala. Gene set overrepresentation 
      analyses consistently implicated cellular metabolic responses and immune 
      processes in the differences observed between mouse strains, while processes 
      favoring neurogenesis and neurotransmission were implicated in the responses to 
      environmental enrichment. In a correlation analysis, lipid metabolism in the 
      anterior amygdala was suggested to influence the levels of optimism. Conclusions: 
      Our observations underscore the importance of selecting appropriate animal models 
      when performing molecular studies of affective conditions or emotional states, 
      and suggest an important role of immune and stress responses in the genetic 
      component of emotion regulation.

TI  - Environmental Enrichment during Gestation Improves Behavior Consequences and

PG  - 157-66

AB  - Prenatal stress can result in various behavior deficits in offspring. Here we 
      tested the effects of environmental enrichment during gestation used as a 
      preventive strategy on the behavior deficits of prenatal-stressed offspring rats 
      as well as the underlying structure basis. We compared the effect size of 
      environmental enrichment during gestation on prenatal-stressed offspring to that 
      of environmental enrichment after weaning. Our results showed that environmental 
      enrichment during gestation partially prevented anxiety and the damage in 
      learning and memory in prenatal-stressed offspring as evaluated by elevated 
      plus-maze test and Morris water maze test. At the same time, environmental 
      enrichment during gestation inhibited the decrease in spine density of CA1 and 
      dentate gyrus neurons and preserved the expression of synaptophysin and 
      glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus of prenatal-stressed offspring. 
      There was no significant difference in offspring behavior between 7-day 
      environmental enrichment during gestation and 14-day offspring environmental 
      enrichment after weaning. These data suggest that environmental enrichment during 
      gestation effectively prevented the behavior deficits and the abnormal synapse 
      structures in prenatal-stressed offspring, and that it can be used as an 
      efficient preventive strategy against prenatal stresses.

TI  - Stress-sensitive antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in the mouse forced swim 
      test.

AB  - Major depression is a stress-linked disease with significant morbidity and the 
      anesthetic drug ketamine is of growing interest in the treatment of depression, 
      since in responsive individuals a single dose has rapid (within hours) 
      antidepressant effects that can be sustained for over a week in some instances. 
      This combination of fast action and a therapeutic effect that lasts far beyond 
      the drug's half-life points to a unique mechanism of action. In this reverse 
      translational study, we investigate the degree to which ketamine counteracts 
      stress-related depression-like behavioral responses by determining whether it 
      affects unstressed animals similarly to stressed mice. To test this, male 
      C57BL/6J mice were given a single injection of vehicle (0.9% saline; i.p.), 10 
      mg/kg ketamine, or 30 mg/kg ketamine, and were tested in the forced swim test 
      (FST) 24 hours and 7 days later, as well as in the open field test on the eighth 
      day. Unstressed mice had normal group housing, environmental enrichment, and 
      experimenter pre-handling (5 days), whereas stressed animals were subjected to 
      chronic mild stress (single housing, reduced enrichment and minimal handling), 
      where some mice also had daily two-week unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). We 
      find that ketamine (24 hours post-injection) decreases immobility and increases 
      mobile (swimming) behavior (antidepressant-like effects) in UCS animals but does 
      the opposite in unstressed mice, similar to recent human findings. In summary, 
      these data suggest that chronic psychological stress interacts with ketamine 
      treatment to modulate its effects in the C57BL/6J mouse FST, which reinforces the 
      relevance of this test, and this strain of mice, to human, stress-induced 
      depression.

AB  - Stress and environmental enrichment have opposing effects on cerebral cellular 
      plasticity. Stress-induced disturbances in neuronal and glial plasticity have 
      been implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. Patients with 
      depression often show volume reductions in specific brain regions. The mechanisms 
      behind these changes are not well understood, but animal studies have indicated 
      that increased levels of glucocorticoids and stress have negative impact on the 
      neuronal and glial cell populations. On the contrary, enriched environment and 
      physical activity have positive effects. In this study we have examined the 
      effect of corticosterone (CORT), environmental enrichment (EE) and running on 
      angiogenesis in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We demonstrate a 
      dramatic inhibition in endothelial cell proliferation in these brain regions in 
      CORT-treated rats. Environmental enrichment had the opposite effect and 
      stimulated endothelial cell proliferation both in the hippocampus and in the PFC. 
      Running had a stimulatory effect in hippocampus, but not in the PFC. We suggest 
      that the angiostatic effect of CORT demonstrated in this study might be 
      paralleled in human subjects exposed to high levels of stress hormones for 
      prolonged periods of time. Raised cortisol levels in depressed or old patients 
      could, by reducing endothelial cell formation/turnover, lead to rarefaction and 
      aging of the vascular bed, and as a result, neuronal function could be impaired. 
      It is tempting to speculate that a physically and intellectually active life may 
      protect against stress-induced vascular changes. Therapeutic agents also 
      targeting the cerebral vasculature could consequently constitute a new tool in 
      the combat of stress-related disorders.

AB  - Exposure to early stressful events increases susceptibility to post-traumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood, in which the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis plays a crucial role. Studies have found that environmental enrichment 
      (EE) mitigates the detrimental outcomes of early adversity. However, the 
      HPA-related mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used the single 
      prolonged stress (SPS) paradigm to explore the long-term effects of early 
      adolescent stress on behavior, HPA axis activity, as well as expression levels of 
      the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), 
      corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRF1R) and CRF2R in the hypothalamus 
      and hippocampus. Meanwhile, the protective effects of EE intervention were 
      examined. We found that adult male rats exposed to adolescent stress showed 
      reduced locomotor activity, increased anxiety-like behaviors, enhanced contextual 
      fear memory, elevated basal plasma ACTH levels, and enhanced HPA negative 
      feedback inhibition, as indicated by decreased plasma ACTH levels in the 
      dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Furthermore, EE normalized the behavioral 
      abnormalities and enhanced HPA negative feedback in stressed rats, possibly 
      through down-regulating GR expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These 
      findings suggested that EE could ameliorate adolescent stress-induced PTSD-like 
      behaviors and aberrant reprogramming of the HPA axis, reducing the risk of 
      developing PTSD in adulthood.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) mimics positive life experiences by providing 
      enhanced social and physical stimulation. Placement into EE following weaning, or 
      in later life, confers beneficial outcomes on both emotional and cognitive 
      processes. However, anxiety-like behavior is also reported, particularly in rats 
      exposed to enhanced housing during early development. Notably, the quality of 
      maternal behavior affects stress regulation and emotional stability in offspring, 
      yet the impact of environmental context on maternal care has not been thoroughly 
      evaluated, or are the influences of EE on their offspring understood. To 
      investigate the role of EE on these factors we analyzed the details of 
      mother-neonate interactions, and juvenile offspring performance on several 
      anxiety measures. Additionally, we evaluated neurochemical differences (i.e. 
      serotonin, corticosterone, GABA, glutamate) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus 
      as a function of EE, Communal Nesting (CN) and Standard Care (SC). Although EE 
      dams spent significantly less time on the nest and had lower nursing frequencies 
      compared to SC dams, there were no differences in maternal licking/grooming. In 
      offspring, EE increased GLUR1 level and GABA concentrations in the prefrontal 
      cortex of both juvenile male and female rats. A similar pattern for glutamate was 
      only observed in males. Although EE offspring spent less time on the open arms of 
      the elevated plus maze and had faster escape latencies in a light-dark test, 
      there were no other indications of anxiety-like behavior on these measures or 
      when engaged in social interaction with a conspecific. In the wild, rats live in 
      complicated and variable environments. Consequently dams must leave their nest to 
      defend and forage, limiting their duration of direct contact. EE exposure in 
      early development may mimic this naturalistic maternal separation, shaping 
      parental behavior and offspring resiliency to stressors.

AB  - Maternal separation is a detrimental postnatal influence, whereas environmental 
      enrichment is a therapeutic and protective agent. It is unclear if long-term 
      environmental enrichment can compensate for the effects of maternal separation 
      stress on memory-related alterations. This study examined how environmental 
      enrichment affected memory functions, anxiety level, Grin2a, Grin2b, BDNF, and 
      cFos expressions in the maternally separated rats. There are seven groups in this 
      study: control (C), maternal separation+standard cage (MS), maternal 
      separation + enriched cage (MSE), enriched cage (E), the maternal separation that 
      decapitated at postnatal 21 (MS21) and standard cage that decapitated at PN21 
      (C21) for hormone and gene expression analysis. The maternal separation procedure 
      consisted of postnatal 21 days. Learning and memory performance were determined 
      with the Morris water tank test; anxiety and locomotor activity were examined 
      with the open field and elevated plus-maze test. The expression levels of genes 
      were measured by the RT-PCR method. Blood corticosterone level was evaluated by 
      the ELISA method. Results showed that MS increased memory performance, locomotor 
      activity, and anxiety, but it did not change gene expression levels. An enriched 
      environment did not change the memory performance, locomotor activity, and 
      related gene expression levels. MSE group increased their memory performance, but 
      the anxiety, locomotor activity, and gene expression level did not change. 
      Grin2a, Grin2b, and BDNF gene expression and corticosterone levels increased in 
      the MS21 group. Maternal separation increased memory performance, but it also 
      increased anxiety. Environmental enrichment alone was insufficient to cause 
      alterations in the memory performance.

AB  - The environmental context during gestation may modulate the postpartum variations 
      in maternal behaviors observed within different animal species. Most of our 
      experimental knowledge on this phenomenon and its physiological effects have been 
      gained by confronting the pregnant mother with stressful situations, with the 
      consensual results indicating a reduced maternal behavior and a hyper reactivity 
      of stress-related neural paths. Here, in contrast, by exposing nulliparous rats 
      strictly during pregnancy to a standard laboratory environment (STD) or a highly 
      stimulating sensory and social environment (EE), we investigated the hypothesis 
      that subjects frequently exposed to social stimuli and novel situations during 
      pregnancy will show postpartum changes in subcortical brain areas' activity 
      related to the processing of social stimuli and novelty, such that there will be 
      modifications in maternal behavior. We found that EE mothers doubled the levels 
      of licking and grooming, and active hovering over pups during the first 
      postpartum week than STD dams, without a difference in the time of contact with 
      the pups. Associated with these behaviors, EE dams showed increased c-Fos 
      immunoreaction in hypothalamic nuclei and distinct responses in amygdalar nuclei, 
      than STD dams. In the maternal defensive test, EE dams tripled the levels of 
      aggressive behaviors of the STD rats. Additionally, in two different tests, EE 
      mothers showed lower levels of postpartum anxiety-like behaviors when confronted 
      with novel situations. Our results demonstrate that the activity of brain areas 
      related to social behavior is adaptable by environmental circumstances 
      experienced during gestation, presumably to prepare the progeny for these 
      particular conditions.

AB  - There is a growing emphasis on the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis as 
      modulator of host behaviour and as therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric 
      disorders. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that early-life stress can 
      exert long-lasting changes on the brain and microbiota, and this early adversity 
      is associated with increased risk for developing depression in later life. The 
      maternal separation (MS) model in rats is a robust paradigm to study the effects 
      of early-life stress on the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Recently, we have shown 
      that polyphenols, naturally occurring compounds associated with several health 
      benefits, have anti-stress effects in in vitro models. In this study, we assess 
      the therapeutic potential of a variety of both flavonoid and non-flavonoid 
      polyphenols in reversing the impact of MS on behaviour and the 
      microbiota-gut-brain axis. Rats underwent a dietary intervention with the 
      naturally-derived polyphenols xanthohumol and quercetin, as well as with a 
      phlorotannin extract for 8 weeks. Treatment with polyphenols prevented the 
      depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours induced by MS, where xanthohumol effects 
      were correlated with rescue of BDNF plasma levels. In addition, MS resulted in 
      altered brain levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and dopamine, 
      accompanied by abnormal elevation of plasma corticosterone. Although polyphenols 
      did not reverse neurotransmitter imbalance, xanthohumol normalised corticosterone 
      levels in MS rats. Finally, we explored the impact of MS and polyphenolic diets 
      on the gut microbiota. We observed profound changes in microbial composition and 
      diversity produced by MS condition and by xanthohumol treatment. Moreover, 
      functional prediction analysis revealed that MS results in altered enrichment of 
      pathways associated with microbiota-brain interactions that are significantly 
      reversed by xanthohumol treatment. These results suggest that naturally-derived 
      polyphenols exert antidepressant-like effects in MS rats, which mechanisms could 
      be potentially mediated by HPA regulation, BDNF levels rescue and modulation of 
      the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the common mental ailments that is 
      triggered by exposure to traumatic events. Till date, the molecular factors 
      conferring risk to the development of PTSD is not well understood. In this study, 
      we have conducted a meta-analysis followed by hierarchical clustering and 
      functional enrichment, to uncover the potential molecular networks and critical 
      genes which play an important role in PTSD. Two datasets of expression profiles 
      from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from 62 control samples and 63 PTSD 
      samples were included in our study. In PTSD samples of GSE860 dataset, we 
      identified 26 genes informative when compared with Post-deploy PTSD condition and 
      58 genes informative when compared with Pre-deploy and Post-deploy PTSD of 
      GSE63878 dataset. We conducted the meta-analysis using Fisher, roP, Stouffer, AW, 
      SR, PR and RP methods in MetaDE package. Results from the rOP method of MetaDE 
      package showed that among these genes, the following showed significant changes 
      including, OR2B6, SOX21, MOBP, IL15, PTPRK, PPBPP2 and SEC14L5. Gene ontology 
      analysis revealed enrichment of these significant PTSD-related genes for cell 
      proliferation, DNA damage and repair (p-value ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, interaction 
      network analysis was performed on these 7 significant genes. This analysis 
      revealed highly connected functional interaction networks with two candidate 
      genes, IL15 and SEC14L5 highly enriched in networks. Overall, from these results, 
      we concluded that these genes can be recommended as some of the potential targets 
      for PTSD.

AB  - Chronic stress refers to nonspecific systemic reactions under the 
      over-stimulation of different external and internal factors for a long time. 
      Previous studies confirmed that chronic psychological stress had a negative 
      effect on almost all tissues and organs. We intended to further identify 
      potential gene targets related to the pathogenesis of chronic stress-induced 
      consequences involved in different diseases. In our study, mice in the model 
      group lived under the condition of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) until 
      they expressed behaviors like depression which were supposed to undergo chronic 
      stress. We applied high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression and 
      obtained transcription profiles in lung tissue from CUMS mice and control mice 
      for analysis. In view of the prediction of high-throughput RNA sequences and 
      bioinformatics software, and mRNA regulatory network was constructed. First, we 
      conducted differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and obtained 282 DEGs between 
      CUMS (group A) and the control model (group B). Then, we conducted functional and 
      pathway enrichment analyses. In general, the function of upregulated regulated 
      DEGs is related to immune and inflammatory responses. PPI network identified 
      several essential genes, of which ten hub genes were related to the T cell 
      receptor signaling pathway. qRT-PCR results verified the regulatory network of 
      mRNA. The expressions of CD28, CD3e, and CD247 increased in mice with CUMS 
      compared with that in control. This illustrated immune pathways are related to 
      the pathological molecular mechanism of chronic stress and may provide 
      information for identifying potential biomarkers and early detection of chronic 
      stress.

TI  - Importance of early environment in the development of post-traumatic stress 
      disorder-like behaviors.
PG  - 129-37
AB  - A number of clinical studies in which early adversities were defined 
      retrospectively, demonstrated that early adverse experiences increased the 
      morbidity rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in later life. However, 
      no prospective studies have yet been conducted to elucidate whether early 
      adversity affects the risk or severity of PTSD. Thus, we examined whether early 
      adversity would strengthen the severity of PTSD symptoms in later life by using 
      neonatal isolation (NI) and single prolonged stress (SPS) as an animal model of 
      PTSD. We measured anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM), 
      contextual freezing in the contextual fear (CF) test, and analgesia in the 
      flinch-jump and hot-plate tests in four groups of adult rats (sham, NI, SPS, and 
      NI+SPS). NI significantly enhanced the SPS-induced decrease in the percentage of 
      open arm time and open arm entries in the EPM, enhanced the SPS-induced increase 
      in contextual freezing, and strengthened SPS-induced analgesia, without any 
      changes in locomotor activity in the open field locomotor test. In addition, we 
      examined the effect of environmental enrichment (EE). Repeated exposure to EE 
      ameliorated the NI-induced enhancement of contextual freezing, but not 
      anxiety-like behavior or analgesia, in response to SPS. The results of the 
      present study demonstrated that while early adversity strengthened PTSD-like 
      symptoms, EE alleviated the enhanced contextual freezing by NI and SPS. These 
      findings suggest that early adversity may worsen dysfunction of the amygdala and 
      hippocampus in PTSD, and an early intervention may alleviate the early 
      adversity-mediated enhancement of hippocampal dysfunction in PTSD.

AB  - Widespread, debilitating and often treatment-resistant, depression and other 
      stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders represent an urgent unmet biomedical 
      and societal problem. Although animal models of these disorders are commonly used 
      to study stress pathogenesis, they are often difficult to translate across 
      species into valuable and meaningful clinically relevant data. To address this 
      problem, here we utilized several cross-species/cross-taxon approaches to 
      identify potential evolutionarily conserved differentially expressed genes and 
      their sets. We also assessed enrichment of these genes for transcription factors 
      DNA-binding sites down- and up- stream from their genetic sequences. For this, we 
      compared our own RNA-seq brain transcriptomic data obtained from chronically 
      stressed rats and zebrafish with publicly available human transcriptomic data for 
      patients with major depression and their respective healthy control groups. 
      Utilizing these data from the three species, we next analyzed their differential 
      gene expression, gene set enrichment and protein-protein interaction networks, 
      combined with validated tools for data pooling. This approach allowed us to 
      identify several key brain proteins (GRIA1, DLG1, CDH1, THRB, PLCG2, NGEF, IKZF1 
      and FEZF2) as promising, evolutionarily conserved and shared affective 'hub' 
      protein targets, as well as to propose a novel gene set that may be used to 
      further study affective pathogenesis. Overall, these approaches may advance 
      cross-species brain transcriptomic analyses, and call for further cross-species 
      studies into putative shared molecular mechanisms of affective pathogenesis.

AB  - We have previously reported that threat-related amygdala activity measured during 
      a baseline fMRI scan predicts the experience of depression and anxiety associated 
      with stressful life events years later. Here, we examine whether two broad 
      measures of childhood environmental enrichment, namely parental educational 
      achievement and subjective parental socioeconomic status, buffer against the 
      effects of amygdala activity on future vulnerability to stress. Analyses of data 
      available from 579 young adults revealed that maternal, but not paternal, 
      educational achievement moderates the association between amygdala activity, 
      recent life stress, and changes in mood and anxiety symptoms, even when 
      controlling for participants' current subjective socioeconomic status. 
      Specifically, only participants reporting lower maternal educational achievement 
      exhibited our previously observed interaction between amygdala activity and 
      future life stress predicting increases in depression and anxiety. These results 
      suggest that higher maternal educational achievement may help buffer stress 
      sensitivity associated with heightened threat-related amygdala activity.

AB  - We assessed the antidepressant-like effects of environmental enrichment (EE) and 
      physical exercise (PE) compared with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
      fluoxetine against the depression-related neurobehavioral alterations induced by 
      postweaning social isolation (SI) in rats. After 1 month of SI, rats were 
      submitted to PE (treadmill), EE, or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), which were compared 
      with naïve SI and group-housed rats. After 1 month, behavior was analyzed in the 
      open field (OFT), the sucrose preference (SPT), and the forced swimming (FST) 
      tests. Afterward, the hippocampal serotonin contents, its metabolite, and 
      turnover were measured. SI induced a depression-related phenotype characterized 
      by a marginal bodyweight gain, anxiety, anhedonia, behavioral despair, and 
      alterations of serotonin metabolism. EE produced the widest and largest 
      antidepressive-like effect, followed by PE and fluoxetine, which were almost 
      equivalent. The treatments, however, affected differentially the neurobehavioral 
      domains investigated. EE exerted its largest effect on anhedonia and was the only 
      treatment inducing anxiolytic-like effects. Fluoxetine, in contrast, produced its 
      largest effect on serotonin metabolism, followed by its anti-behavioral despair 
      action. PE was a middle-ground treatment with broader behavioral outcomes than 
      fluoxetine, but ineffective to reverse the serotonergic alterations induced by 
      SI. The most responsive test to the treatments was the FST, followed closely by 
      the SPT. Although OFT locomotion and body weight varied considerably between 
      groups, they were barely responsive to PE and fluoxetine. From a translational 
      standpoint, our data suggest that exercise and recreational activities may have 
      broader health benefits than antidepressants to overcome confinement and the 
      consequences of chronic stress.

AB  - Challenging early life events can dramatically affect mental health and 
      wellbeing. Childhood trauma and neglect can increase the risk for developing 
      depressive, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. Early maternal separation in 
      rodents has been extensively studied and induces long-lasting alterations in 
      affective and stress responses. However, other developmental periods (e.g., the 
      pubertal period) comprise a critical window whereby social and environmental 
      complexity can exert lasting changes on the brain and behavior. In this study, we 
      tested whether early life environmental complexity impacts affective responses, 
      aggressive behaviors, and expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), 
      the synthetic enzyme for nitric oxide, in adulthood. Mice were weaned into 
      social+nonsocial enrichment, social only enrichment, or standard (isolated) 
      laboratory environments and were tested in open field, elevated plus maze, forced 
      swim, and resident-intruder aggression tests 60 days later. Social+nonsocial 
      enrichment reduced locomotor behavior and anxiety-like responses in the open 
      field and reduced depressive-like responses in the forced swim test. Social 
      housing increased open arm exploration in the elevated plus maze. Both 
      social+nonsocial enrichment and social housing only reduced aggressive behaviors 
      compared with isolation. Social+nonsocial enrichment also increased body mass 
      gain throughout the study. Finally, socially-housed mice had reduced 
      corticosterone concentrations compared with social+nonsocial-enriched mice. 
      Behavioral testing reduced nNOS-positive neurons in the basolateral amygdala and 
      the ventral lateral septum, but not in the social+nonsocial-enriched mice, 
      suggesting that environmental complexity may buffer the brain against some 
      environmental perturbations.

TI  - Porches as Enrichment for Singly Housed Cynomolgus Macaques (Macaca 
      fascicularis).
PG  - 134-137
AB  - Effective environmental enrichment is used by animals, promotes species-typical 
      behavior, and decreases abnormal behavior. Porches attached to the front of an 
      animal's cage provide additional space, perching opportunities, and a better view 
      of the surroundings. Here we assessed the effectiveness of porches as a form of 
      enrichment and identified characteristics of the animals most likely to use the 
      porches. We videorecorded and scored the behavior of 18 (9 male, 9 female) singly 
      housed cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) during 3 observation intervals 
      (15 min each) the week before, during, and after exposure to the porches. Changes 
      in abnormal and tension-related behaviors (pacing, yawning, scratching) and 
      speciestypical behaviors were compared across the 3 wk of observation. Novel 
      object temperament tests were performed before and after the study. During 
      observation periods, subjects spent an average of 75% of time in the porch. No 
      changes in pacing or tension-related behaviors occurred, but activity decreased 
      during and after porch exposure, rest increased during the porch exposure, and 
      consumption decreased afterward. Eight subjects were categorized as having a bold 
      temperament, and the remaining 10 subjects had an intermediate temperament. Sex 
      and a temperament×cage location interaction were predictors of porch usage. Males 
      used the porches more than did females, and those with an intermediate 
      temperament were less likely to use the porches when they were located in the 
      lower cages. Porches are beneficial in that they are used for extensive periods 
      of time, but the benefits can vary according to the individual animal.

AB  - Housing conditions represent an important environmental variable playing a 
      critical role in the assessment of mouse behaviour. In the present study the 
      effects of isolation and nesting material on the behaviour of female C57BL/6J 
      mice were evaluated. The mice were subjected to different rearing conditions from 
      weaning (at the age of 3 weeks). The study groups were group- and single-housed 
      mice, divided further into groups with or without nesting material 
      (species-specific enrichment). After 8 weeks spent in respective conditions the 
      behavioural testing began. Both factors (social conditions and nesting material) 
      appeared to have a significant impact on the behavioural phenotype. However, it 
      is important to stress that the interaction between the factors was virtually 
      absent. We established that isolation increased locomotor activity and reduced 
      anxiety-like behaviour in several tests of exploration. In contrast, absence of 
      nesting material increased anxiety-like behaviour. Neither factor affected 
      rota-rod performance, nociception and prepulse inhibition. Contextual fear memory 
      was significantly reduced in single-housed mice, and interestingly, in mice with 
      nesting material. Cued fear memory was reduced by single-housing, but not 
      affected by enrichment. Mice from enriched cages displayed faster and better 
      learning and spatial search strategy in the water maze. In contrast, isolation 
      caused significant impairment in the water maze. In conclusion, both isolation 
      and species-specific enrichment have profound effects on mouse behaviour and 
      should be considered in design of the experiments and in assessment of animal 
      welfare issues.

TI  - Effects of early and later life environmental enrichment and personality on 
      attention bias in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus).
PG  - 959-972
LID - 10.1007/s10071-019-01287-w [doi]
AB  - We investigated effects of early and later life housing on attention bias, as an 
      indicator of affective state, in pigs differing in coping style [reactive (LR) 
      vs. proactive (HR)]. Pigs (n = 128) in barren or enriched housing from birth (B1 
      vs. E1) that experienced either a switch in housing at 7 weeks of age or not 
      (creating B1B2, B1E2, E1E2, and E1B2 treatments), were studied in a 180-s 
      attention bias test at 11 weeks. Pigs exposed to a 
      10-s-auditory-and-sudden-motion threat in the test arena paid more attention to 
      the location of the threat, were more vigilant, showed less eating, more walking 
      and were more likely to utter high-pitched vocalisations than non-threat pigs. 
      During threat presence, HR pigs from post-switch enriched housing (E2-HR, i.e., 
      B1E2 + E1E2) showed more vigilance but less exploration than others. After threat 
      removal, no effects were found on time spent paying attention to the threat, 
      vigilance, and eating, but E2-HR pigs paid attention to the threat more 
      frequently, were more likely to utter high-pitched vocalisations and walked more 
      compared to (part of) other groups, suggesting the most negative affective state 
      in these animals. E2 pigs grunted more than B2 pigs. Thus, current housing, but 
      not early life housing, affected behaviour in a personality-dependent manner in 
      this attention bias test. Housing effects were opposite to expectation, possibly 
      due to the short-term effect of the relative contrast between the home pens of 
      the pigs and the test room. This potentially overruled putative long-term effects 
      of environmental conditions on attention bias.

TI  - The effects of environmental enrichment on depressive and anxiety-relevant 
      behaviors in socially isolated prairie voles.

LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000052 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Social isolation is associated with depression, anxiety, and negative 
      health outcomes. Environmental enrichment, including environmental and cognitive 
      stimulation with inanimate objects and opportunities for physical exercise, may 
      be an effective strategy to include in treatment paradigms for affective 
      disorders as a function of social isolation. In a rodent model-the socially 
      monogamous prairie vole-we investigated the hypothesis that depression- and 
      anxiety-related behaviors after social isolation would be prevented and 
      remediated with environmental enrichment. METHODS: Experiment 1 investigated the 
      preventive effects of environmental enrichment on negative affective behaviors 
      when administered concurrently with social isolation. Experiment 2 investigated 
      the remediating effects of enrichment on negative affective behaviors when 
      administered after a period of isolation. Behaviors were measured in three 
      operational tests: open field, forced swim test (FST), and elevated plus maze. 
      RESULTS: In isolated prairie voles, enrichment prevented depression-relevant 
      (immobility in FST, group × housing interaction, p = .049) and anxiety-relevant 
      behaviors (exploration in open field, group × housing interaction, p = .036; 
      exploration in elevated plus maze, group × housing interaction, p = .049). 
      Delayed enrichment also remediated these behaviors in isolated animals 
      (immobility in FST, main effect of housing, p = .001; exploration in open field, 
      main effect of housing, p = .047; exploration in elevated plus maze, main effect 
      of housing, p = .001) and was slightly more effective than physical exercise 
      alone in remediating anxiety-relevant behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      provide insight into the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on 
      depression- and anxiety-relevant behaviors using a translational rodent model of 
      social isolation.

      extinction and reinstatement of ethanol conditioned place preference in C57BL/6

AB  - RATIONALE: During the last few decades, alcohol use disorders (AUD) have reached 
      an epidemic prevalence, yet social influences on alcoholism have not been fully 
      addressed. Several factors can modulate alcohol intake. On one hand, stress can 
      reinforce ethanol-induced behaviors and be an important component in AUD and 
      alcoholism. On the other hand, environmental enrichment (EE) has a 
      neuroprotective role and prevents the development of excessive ethanol intake in 
      rodents. However, studies showing the role of EE in chronic psychosocial 
      stress-impaired ethanol-conditioned rewards are nonexistent. AIM: The purpose of 
      the current study is to explore the potential protective role of EE on extinction 
      and reinstatement of ethanol-conditioned place preference (EtOH-CPP) following 
      chronic psychosocial stress. METHODS: In the first experiment and after the 
      EtOH-CPP test, the mice were subjected to 15 days of chronic stress, then housed 
      in a standard (SE) or enriched environment (EE) while EtOH-CPP extinction was 
      achieved by repeated exposure to the CPP chambers without ethanol injection. In 
      the second experiment and after the EtOH-CPP test, extinction was achieved as 
      described above. Mice were then exposed to chronic stress for 2 weeks before 
      being housed in a SE or EE. EtOH-CPP reinstatement was induced by a single 
      exposure to the conditioning chambers. RESULTS: As expected, stress exposure 
      increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced weight gain. More importantly, we 
      found that EE significantly shortened chronic stress-delayed extinction and 
      decreased the reinstatement of EtOH-CPP. CONCLUSION: These results support the 
      hypothesis that EE reduces the impact of alcohol-associated environmental 
      stimuli, and hence it may be a general intervention for reducing cue-elicited 
      craving and relapse in humans.

AB  - The early stress of maternal separation (ES) exerts long-lasting effects on 
      cognition and anxiety. Recent evidence indicates enhanced hippocampus-dependent 
      spatial learning in young adult ES animals, which shifts towards a decline in 
      long-term memory in middle-aged life. Further, we find that ES animals exhibit 
      enhanced anxiety in young adulthood that does not persist into middle-aged life. 
      Here, we demonstrate unique, predominantly non-overlapping, hippocampal 
      transcriptomes in young adult and middle-aged ES animals that accompany the 
      temporally-specific behavioural consequences. Strikingly, the extent of gene 
      dysregulation in middle-aged ES animals was substantially higher than in young 
      adulthood. Functional analysis revealed distinct biological processes enriched at 
      the two ages, highlighting the temporal shift in ES-evoked gene regulation. Our 
      results suggest that ES history interacts with aging to exacerbate age-associated 
      transcriptional changes and cognitive decline. qPCR profiling of histone 
      deacetylases (Hdacs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs) revealed an 
      age-dependent, opposing regulation with decreased expression noted in young adult 
      ES animals (Hdac 2, 7, 8, 9 and Suv39h1) and enhanced levels in middle-aged life 
      (Hdac 2, 6, 8 and Suv39h1). While altered expression of histone modifying enzymes 
      did not translate into global histone acetylation or methylation changes, we 
      noted differential enrichment of histone acetylation and methylation 
      modifications at the promoters of multiple genes regulated in the hippocampi of 
      young adult and middle-aged ES animals. Our results highlight the differential 
      molecular and behavioural consequences of ES across a life-span, and suggest a 
      possible role for epigenetic mechanisms in contributing to the 
      temporally-specific transcriptional changes following ES.

AB  - Methamphetamine alters behavior and the stress response system. Relatively little 
      research has examined the effects of methamphetamine in adolescents and compared 
      these effects to those in adults. Housing in enriched environments has been 
      explored as one way to protect against the effects of methamphetamine, but the 
      findings are conflicting and no study has examined how enriched environment may 
      alter the behavioral and corticosterone responses to methamphetamine in 
      adolescent and adult rodents. We examined the long-term effects of 
      methamphetamine exposure on anxiety, social behavior, behavioral despair, and 
      corticosterone levels in adolescent and adult mice housed in enriched or isolated 
      environments. Enriched environment did not alter the behavioral or corticosterone 
      response to methamphetamine. Methamphetamine exposure decreased anxiety and 
      increased behavioral despair in adult mice, but methamphetamine did not alter 
      behavior in adolescent mice. There was no effect of methamphetamine on social 
      behavior or corticosterone levels. Our findings demonstrate that the specific 
      environmental enrichment paradigm used in this study was not sufficient to 
      mitigate the behavioral effects of methamphetamine and that adolescent mice are 
      relatively resistant to the effects of methamphetamine compared to adult mice.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of environmental manipulation on female 
      Wistar Kyoto (WKY), an animal model of depression, and female Wistar rats. It 
      explored the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and immune 
      system, as they have both been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. A 
      further goal was to characterize the immune cytokine concentrations of female WKY 
      rats as this has, to our knowledge, never been documented. Animals were assigned 
      to enriched, standard, or impoverished housing for four consecutive weeks. 
      Following this, serum was collected at baseline and post-stress periods to 
      measure the concentration of corticosterone, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10. WKY animals 
      had significantly higher corticosterone levels at the post-stress time-point than 
      their Wistar counterparts. WKY females in isolation tended to have the lowest 
      corticosterone levels which may indicate that they prefer a solitary environment, 
      a symptom of depression. We observed a significant decrease in TNF-α after 
      enrichment in the Wistar strain. A similar decrease in TNF-α was found in the WKY 
      strain, but there was no difference between environmental conditions. There was a 
      significant increase in pre- to post-stress IL-10 level in both Wistar and WKY 
      animals. WKY females had a significantly lower level of IL-1β as compared to the 
      Wistar animals at both pre- and post-stress time points. Given this strain 
      difference, it is likely that the WKY rats had a dysregulated HPA axis which 
      further influenced their circulating cytokine levels. Further studies are needed 
      to examine how this pattern of findings plays a role in the pathophysiology of 
      depression.

TI  - Fluoxetine and environmental enrichment similarly reverse chronic social 
      stress-related depression- and anxiety-like behavior, but have differential 
      effects on amygdala gene expression.
PG  - 100392

AB  - The adverse effects of stress on brain and behavior have long been known and 
      well-studied, with abundant evidence linking stress to, among other things, mood 
      and anxiety disorders. Likewise, many have investigated potential treatments for 
      stress-related mood and anxiety phenotypes and demonstrated good response to 
      standard antidepressant medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs), as well as environmental manipulations like exercise or enrichment. 
      However, the extent to which stress and various treatments act on overlapping 
      pathways in the brain is less well understood. Here, we used a widely studied 
      social defeat stress paradigm to induce a robust depression- and anxiety-like 
      phenotype and chronic corticosterone elevation that persisted for at least 4 
      weeks in wild type male mice. When mice were treated with either the SSRI 
      fluoxetine or an enriched environment, both led to similar behavioral recovery 
      from social defeat. We then focused on the amygdala and assessed the effects of 
      social defeat, fluoxetine, and enrichment on 168 genes broadly related to 
      synaptic plasticity or oxidative stress. We found 24 differentially expressed 
      genes in response to social defeat stress. Interestingly, fluoxetine led to broad 
      normalization of the stress-induced expression pattern while enrichment led to 
      expression changes in a separate set of genes. Together, this study provides 
      additional insight into the chronic effects of social defeat stress on behavior 
      and gene expression in the amygdala. The findings also suggest that, for a subset 
      of genes assessed, fluoxetine and environmental enrichment have strikingly 
      divergent effects on expression in the amygdala, despite leading to similar 
      behavioral outcomes.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that paternal stress in rodents can result in 
      modification of offspring behavior. Environmental enrichment, which enhances 
      cognitive stimulation and physical activity, modifies various behaviors and 
      reduces stress responses in adult rodents. We investigated the transgenerational 
      influence of paternal environmental enrichment on offspring behavior and 
      physiological stress response. Adult C57BL/6J male mice (F0) were exposed to 
      either environmental enrichment or standard housing for four weeks and then 
      pair-mated with naïve females. The F2 generation was generated using F1 male 
      offspring. Male and female F1 and F2 offspring were tested for anxiety using the 
      elevated-plus maze and large open field at 8 weeks of age. Depression-related 
      behavior was assessed using the forced-swim test. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis function was determined by quantification of serum corticosterone and 
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels at baseline and after forced-swim 
      stress. Paternal environmental enrichment was associated with increased body 
      weights of male F1 and F2 offspring. There was no significant effect on F1 
      offspring anxiety and depression-related behaviors. There were no changes in 
      anxiety-related behaviors in the F2 offspring, however these mice displayed a 
      reduced latency to immobility in the forced-swim test. Furthermore, F2 females 
      had significantly higher serum corticosterone levels post-stress, but not ACTH. 
      These results show that paternal environmental enrichment exerts a sex-specific 
      transgenerational impact on the behavioral and physiological response to stress. 
      Our findings have implications for the modelling of psychiatric disorders in 
      rodents.

TI  - Enrichment of the rats diet with docosahexaenoic acid and astaxanthin: 
      physiological and biochemical efficiency.
PG  - 46-55
AB  - To investigate the effect of enrichment of the rats diet with polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (PUFA) ω-3 (220 mg docosahexaenoic acid per 1 kg of animal body 
      weight per day) and astaxanthin (5 mg/kg body weight) on serum corticosterone 
      concentration, physical fatigue, anxiety of rats after exhausting the load. 
      During 30 days the rats of the test group received the diet in which the usual 
      fat component comprising sunflower oil and lard (1:1) was completely replaced by 
      the mixture of oils (high oleic sunflower (89%), coconut (6%), and marine oil 
      from microalgae Schizochytrium sp. (5%) with a high content of docosahexaenoic 
      acid with the addition of astaxanthin). Ratio of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA in the lipid 
      component of the experimental diet was 5.2:1 (n=12) and 135:1 in the diet of rats 
      in the control group (n=12). DHA enrichment of the diet resulted in a significant 
      10-fold increase of the DHA liver content and ω-6 PUFA reducing (in particular of 
      linoleic acid in 2.7-fold). No significant differences have been identified 
      between the groups in terms of anxiety, estimated on the elevated plus maze at 
      the beginning and on 24th day of the experiment. Results of the exhausting load 
      on a treadmill (25th day) showed a significant reduction in physical fatigue in 
      rats of the experimental group compared with the control group of rats: the 
      number of contacts with the electrical grid was 4.2±0.9 versus 19.7±4.4, fulltime 
      shock was 0.9±0.2 versus 3.3±0.8 sec. Significantly lower serum corticosterone 
      concentration took place in the subjected to exhausting exertion animals 
      receiving lipid module (15.0±3.9 ng/ml) compared to control animals (31.0±5.4 
      ng/ml). Thus, modification of the lipid component of the diet by its enrichment 
      with DHA and astaxanthin led to decrease of the rat fatigue during exercise 
      training (test treadmill) and prevent from the serum corticosterone raise, that 
      indicates animal stress adaptation ability.

TI  - Diet Prevents Social Stress-Induced Maladaptive Neurobehavioural and Gut 
      Microbiota Changes in a Histamine-Dependent Manner.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23020862 [doi]
LID - 862
AB  - Exposure to repeated social stress may cause maladaptive emotional reactions that 
      can be reduced by healthy nutritional supplementation. Histaminergic 
      neurotransmission has a central role in orchestrating specific behavioural 
      responses depending on the homeostatic state of a subject, but it remains to be 
      established if it participates in the protective effects against the insults of 
      chronic stress afforded by a healthy diet. By using C57BL/6J male mice that do 
      not synthesize histamine (Hdc(-/-)) and their wild type (Hdc(+/+)) congeners we 
      evaluated if the histaminergic system participates in the protective action of a 
      diet enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin A on the deleterious 
      effect of chronic stress. Behavioural tests across domains relevant to cognition 
      and anxiety were performed. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity, cytokine expression, 
      hippocampal fatty acids, oxylipins and microbiota composition were also assessed. 
      Chronic stress induced social avoidance, poor recognition memory, affected 
      hippocampal long-term potentiation, changed the microbiota profile, brain 
      cytokines, fatty acid and oxylipins composition of both Hdc(-/-) and Hdc(+/+) 
      mice. Dietary enrichment counteracted stress-induced deficits only in Hdc(+/+) 
      mice as histamine deficiency prevented almost all the diet-related beneficial 
      effects. Interpretation: Our results reveal a previously unexplored and novel 
      role for brain histamine as a mediator of many favorable effects of the enriched 
      diet. These data present long-reaching perspectives in the field of nutritional 
      neuropsychopharmacology.

AB  - Early adverse life experiences have been associated with anxiety-like behavior 
      and memory impairment. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play an important 
      role in brain development. Enriched environments are known to positively 
      influence emotional and cognitive functions in the brain. We examined the effects 
      of maternal deprivation (MD) on NMDAR subunits in the hippocampus, locomotor 
      activity, anxiety behaviors, and learning-memory performance of Balb/c mice. We 
      also examined whether these effects could be reversed by raising the offspring in 
      an enriched environment. The mice were separated from their mothers for a single 
      24h episode on postnatal day (PND) 9. The mice were weaned on day 21 and were 
      housed under either standard (SE) or enriched (EE) environmental conditions. 
      Emotional behaviors and cognitive processes of mice were evaluated using an open 
      field (OF) test, an elevated plus maze (EPM) test, and a Morris water-maze (MWM). 
      NMDAR subunits (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) mRNA expression levels in the 
      hippocampus were examined by real-time PCR. In OF, MD had no effect on horizontal 
      locomotor activity. MD increased anxiety-like behaviors in the EPM and decreased 
      spatial learning performance in MWM; however, these effects were not reversed by 
      EE. MD (in SE and EE conditions) increased GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B mRNA 
      expressions in the hippocampus. In conclusion, MD led to the deterioration of the 
      emotional and cognitive processes during adulthood. Moreover, environmental 
      enrichment did not reverse the deleterious effects of the MD on emotional and 
      cognitive functions and increased the NMDAR levels.

AB  - Environmental enrichment attenuates the response to psychostimulants and has been 
      shown to reduce both anxiety and stress-related behaviors. Since stress is a 
      major vulnerability factor for addiction, we investigated whether enrichment 
      could reverse stress profiles in high anxious rats as well as reduce their 
      amphetamine sensitivity. Using selectively-bred high and low anxiety males 
      (filial 3) from enriched, social or isolated environments, we tested elevated 
      plus maze exploration, novelty place preference and amphetamine (AMPH; 0.5mg/kg, 
      IP)-induced hyperactivity. We measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) response 
      after forced novel object exposure, phosphorylation of the tropomyosin-related 
      kinase B receptor (pTrkB) in the hippocampus and striatum, and dopamine (D2) 
      receptor mRNA levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Results indicate that 
      high anxiety animals reared in social or enriched environments spent more time on 
      open arms of the EPM while low anxiety animals raised in enriched environments 
      spent more time on open arms when compared to either isolated or social groups. 
      There were no group differences or interactions found for novelty place 
      preference. Enriched environments decreased the response to AMPH and 
      stress-induced CORT regardless of trait but selectively decreased pTrkB and 
      increased D2 mRNA levels in high anxiety animals. The results suggest that 
      selectively-bred trait anxiety rats show state anxiety that is influenced by 
      rearing environments, and D2 protein levels and BDNF/TrkB signaling may 
      differentially contribute to integrating these effects.

AB  - Properties of the environment play an important role in animal wellbeing and may 
      modulate the effects of external threats. Whereas stressors can affect emotion 
      and impair cognition, environmental enrichment may prevent the occurrence of such 
      negative sequelae. Animals exposed to semi-natural group-housing experience a 
      complex environment; whereas environmental enrichment might protect against 
      stressors, a socially-enriched environment(SEE) could entail aggressive 
      inter-male encounters with additive stress effects. In the present study, we 
      investigated the effects of exposure to external stressors, footshocks and forced 
      swimming, on adrenal gland and body weights as well as on behavior in rats housed 
      under SEE or standard, non-enriched environment (NEE), conditions. We found that 
      SEEs reduced the anxiogenic effects of stress. Moreover, SEEs improved the 
      performance in an operant task and prevented the increase in impulsive behavior 
      produced by external stressors on NEE animals. Whereas these findings are 
      indicative of stress-buffering effects of SEEs, adrenal gland weights were 
      increased while total body weights were decreased in SEE rats, suggesting that 
      SEEs may simultaneously exacerbate physiological measurements of stress. Finally, 
      in the SEE, total aggressive behaviors and body wounds were paradoxically reduced 
      in animals that received external stressors in comparison to non-stressed 
      controls. The consequences of the external stressors applied here are not 
      uniform, varying according to the housing condition and the outcome considered.

TI  - Influence of differential housing on emotional behaviour and neurotrophin levels 
      in mice.
PG  - 10-20
AB  - Environmental enrichment condition (EC) induces profound behavioural, 
      neurochemical and neuroanatomical changes. Increasing evidence has shown that the 
      hippocampus, which is implicated in a range of cognitive functions, including 
      learning and memory, is one of the most susceptible brain areas to the effects of 
      enriched rearing. Recent work also suggests that the hippocampus is functionally 
      segregated; lesion studies have shown that the dorsal hippocampus is important 
      for spatial learning, whereas the ventral part is critical in emotional behaviour 
      in rats. We investigated the effects of differential housing environments on 
      anxiety-related behaviour and neurotrophin levels in dorsal and ventral 
      hippocampus, and other brain regions. Ninety-six male and female C57BL/6 mice 
      were reared in EC or standard housing condition (SC) for 4 months after weaning. 
      Thereafter sixty-four animals were tested in the elevated plus-maze, open-field, 
      novel-objects exploration and food neophobia. Thirty-two animals remained as 
      untested. Subsequently, brain nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analysed in selected brain regions of the tested 
      and non-tested animals. Differential housing influenced anxiety-related behaviour 
      in the plus-maze and brain neurotrophins. Baseline levels of BDNF and NGF protein 
      were differently distributed in dorsal and ventral parts of hippocampus in both 
      male and female mice, with levels in the dorsal hippocampal being consistently 
      higher than those in ventral hippocampus. Exposure to behavioural testing induced 
      complex changes on neurotrophin levels in selected brain regions. This study 
      demonstrates for the first time the differential distribution of normal levels of 
      neurotrophin protein in dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice, and these levels 
      can be affected by environmental enrichment and have an impact on emotional 
      behaviour.

AB  - Chronic stress contributes to the risk of developing depression; the habenula, a 
      nucleus in epithalamus, is associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders. Using 
      genome-wide gene expression analysis, we analyzed the transcriptome of the 
      habenula in rats exposed to chronic restraint stress for 14 days. We identified 
      379 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were affected by chronic stress. 
      These genes were enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the cAMP 
      (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signaling pathway, circadian entrainment, and 
      synaptic signaling from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway 
      analysis and responded to corticosteroids, positive regulation of lipid 
      transport, anterograde trans-synaptic signaling, and chemical synapse 
      transmission from the Gene Ontology analysis. Based on protein-protein 
      interaction network analysis of the DEGs, we identified neuroactive 
      ligand-receptor interactions, circadian entrainment, and cholinergic 
      synapse-related subclusters. Additionally, cell type and habenular regional 
      expression of DEGs, evaluated using a recently published single-cell RNA 
      sequencing study (GSE137478), strongly suggest that DEGs related to neuroactive 
      ligand-receptor interaction and trans-synaptic signaling are highly enriched in 
      medial habenular neurons. Taken together, our findings provide a valuable set of 
      molecular targets that may play important roles in mediating the habenular 
      response to stress and the onset of chronic stress-induced depressive behaviors.

TI  - Environmental enrichment induces behavioural disturbances in neuropeptide Y

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) refers to the provision of a complex and 
      stimulating housing condition which improves well-being, behaviour and brain 
      function of laboratory animals. The mechanisms behind these beneficial effects of 
      EE are only partially understood. In the current report, we describe a link 
      between EE and neuropeptide Y (NPY), based on findings from NPY knockout (KO) 
      mice exposed to EE. Relative to EE-housed wildtype (WT) animals, NPY KO mice 
      displayed altered behaviour as well as molecular and morphological changes in 
      amygdala and hippocampus. Exposure of WT mice to EE reduced anxiety and decreased 
      central glucocorticoid receptor expression, effects which were absent in NPY KO 
      mice. In addition, NPY deletion altered the preference of EE items, and EE-housed 
      NPY KO mice responded to stress with exaggerated hyperthermia, displayed impaired 
      spatial memory, had higher hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA 
      levels and altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity, effects which were not seen 
      in WT mice. Accordingly, these findings suggest that NPY contributes to the 
      anxiolytic effect of EE and that NPY deletion reverses the beneficial effects of 
      EE into a negative experience. The NPY system could thus be a target for 
      "enviromimetics", therapeutics which reproduce the beneficial effects of enhanced 
      environmental stimulation.

TI  - An epigenome-wide DNA methylation study of PTSD and depression in World Trade 
      Center responders.
PG  - e1158
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.130 [doi]
AB  - Previous epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) have been inconsistent. This 
      may be due to small sample sizes, and measurement and tissue differences. The 
      current two EWA analyses of 473 World Trade Center responders are the largest to 
      date for both PTSD and MDD. These analyses investigated DNA methylation patterns 
      and biological pathways influenced by differentially methylated genes associated 
      with each disorder. Methylation was profiled on blood samples using Illumina 
      450 K Beadchip. Two EWA analyses compared current versus never PTSD, and current 
      versus never MDD, adjusting for cell types and demographic confounders. Pathway 
      and gene set enrichment analyses were performed to understand the complex 
      biological systems of PTSD and MDD. No significant epigenome-wide associations 
      were found for PTSD or MDD at an FDR P<0.05. The majority of genes with 
      differential methylation at a suggestive threshold did not overlap between the 
      two disorders. Pathways significant in PTSD included a regulator of synaptic 
      plasticity, oxytocin signaling, cholinergic synapse and inflammatory disease 
      pathways, while only phosphatidylinositol signaling and cell cycle pathways 
      emerged in MDD. The failure of the current EWA analyses to detect significant 
      epigenome-wide associations is in contrast with disparate findings from previous, 
      smaller EWA and candidate gene studies of PTSD and MDD. Enriched gene sets 
      involved in several biological pathways, including stress response, inflammation 
      and physical health, were identified in PTSD, supporting the view that multiple 
      genes play a role in this complex disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex differences in the expression and prevalence of trauma- and 
      stress-related disorders have led to a growing interest in the sex-specific 
      molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying these diseases. Cyclin-dependent 
      kinase 5 (CDK5) is known to underlie both fear memory and stress behavior in male 
      mice. Given our recent finding that targeted histone acetylation of Cdk5 
      regulates stress responsivity in male mice, we hypothesized that such a mechanism 
      may be functionally relevant in female mice as well. METHODS: We applied 
      epigenetic editing of Cdk5 in the hippocampus and examined the regulation of fear 
      memory retrieval in male and female mice. Viral expression of zinc finger 
      proteins targeting histone acetylation to the Cdk5 promoter was paired with a 
      quantification of learning and memory of contextual fear conditioning, expression 
      of CDK5, and enrichment of histone modifications of the Cdk5 gene. RESULTS: We 
      found that male mice exhibit stronger long-term memory retrieval than do female 
      mice, and this finding was associated with male-specific epigenetic activation of 
      hippocampal Cdk5 expression. Sex differences in behavior and epigenetic 
      regulation of Cdk5 occurred after long-term, but not short-term, fear memory 
      retrieval. Finally, targeted histone acetylation of hippocampal Cdk5 promoter 
      attenuated fear memory retrieval and increased tau phosphorylation in female but 
      not male mice. CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic editing uncovered a female-specific role 
      of Cdk5 activation in attenuating fear memory retrieval. This finding may be 
      attributed to CDK5 mediated hyperphosphorylation of tau only in the female 
      hippocampus. Sex-specific epigenetic regulation of Cdk5 may reflect differences 
      in the effect of CDK5 on downstream target proteins that regulate memory.

AB  - The consumption of probiotics has become increasingly popular as a means to try 
      to improve health and well-being. Not only are probiotics considered beneficial 
      to digestive health, but increasing evidence suggests direct and indirect 
      interactions between gut microbiota (GM) and the central nervous system (CNS). 
      Here, adult zebrafish were supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum to determine 
      the effects of probiotic treatment on structural and functional changes of the 
      GM, as well as host neurological and behavioral changes. L. plantarum 
      administration altered the β-diversity of the GM while leaving the major core 
      architecture intact. These minor structural changes were accompanied by 
      significant enrichment of several predicted metabolic pathways. In addition to GM 
      modifications, L. plantarum treatment also significantly reduced anxiety-related 
      behavior and altered GABAergic and serotonergic signaling in the brain. Lastly, 
      L. plantarum supplementation provided protection against stress-induced dysbiosis 
      of the GM. These results underscore the influence commensal microbes have on 
      physiological function in the host, and demonstrate bidirectional communication 
      between the GM and the host.

TI  - Frustration and perseveration in stereotypic captive animals: is a taste of 
      enrichment worse than none at all?
PG  - 96-104
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2010.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Stereotypic behaviours are common in animals in impoverished housing, arising 
      from two complementary processes: (1) thwarted attempts to perform motivated 
      behaviours; (2) forebrain dysfunction impeding normal behavioural inhibition. 
      When enriched animals are moved to impoverished housing, they are sometimes 
      protected against developing stereotypic behaviour, but in other cases become 
      even more stereotypic than animals housed lifelong without enrichment. Negative 
      contrast-induced frustration must occur in both scenarios. We hypothesise that 
      sustained behavioural responses to this frustration are prevented in the former 
      by normalised forebrain function, but exacerbated in the latter by forebrain 
      dysfunction. ICRCD-1 mice reared in enriched or standard cages were re-caged at 3 
      months to standard conditions. Here, previously-enriched mice became far more 
      stereotypic than mice reared from birth in such conditions. To investigate the 
      role of frustration, we assessed both corticosterone output and motivation 
      (break-point) to regain enrichments. We also assessed perseveration via 
      extinction learning. As predicted, previously-enriched mice were as perseverative 
      as standard-raised mice, and frustration seemed to play a causal role in their 
      exacerbated stereotypic behaviour. Previously-enriched mice showed higher 
      motivations to access enrichments, and only in this group did these correlate 
      with corticosterone levels after re-caging; furthermore only in 
      previously-enriched mice did corticosterone responses to re-caging predict 
      stereotypic behaviour 30 days later (males only). All results need replicating 
      and further investigation. However, they suggest for the first time that 
      individual risk factors related to the HPA axis predict stereotypic behaviour 
      following enrichment-removal, and that previously-enriched mice have lasting 
      motivational differences from standard-raised mice, suggesting sustained 
      behavioural effects related to the frustration of enrichment-loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear/anxiety and anger/aggression greatly influence health, quality 
      of life and social interactions. They are a huge burden to wellbeing, and 
      personal and public economics. However, while much is known about the physiology 
      and neuroanatomy of such emotions, little is known about their genetics - most 
      importantly, why some individuals are more susceptible to pathology under stress. 
      RESULTS: We conducted genomewide association (GWA) mapping of breed stereotypes 
      for many fear and aggression traits across several hundred dogs from diverse 
      breeds. We confirmed those findings using GWA in a second cohort of partially 
      overlapping breeds. Lastly, we used the validated loci to create a model that 
      effectively predicted fear and aggression stereotypes in a third group of dog 
      breeds that were not involved in the mapping studies. We found that i) known IGF1 
      and HMGA2 loci variants for small body size are associated with separation 
      anxiety, touch-sensitivity, owner directed aggression and dog rivalry; and ii) 
      two loci, between GNAT3 and CD36 on chr18, and near IGSF1 on chrX, are associated 
      with several traits, including touch-sensitivity, non-social fear, and fear and 
      aggression that are directed toward unfamiliar dogs and humans. All four genome 
      loci are among the most highly evolutionarily-selected in dogs, and each of those 
      was previously shown to be associated with morphological traits. We propose that 
      the IGF1 and HMGA2 loci are candidates for identical variation being associated 
      with both behavior and morphology. In contrast, we show that the GNAT3-CD36 locus 
      has distinct variants for behavior and morphology. The chrX region is a special 
      case due to its extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD). Our evidence strongly 
      suggests that sociability (which we propose is associated with HS6ST2) and 
      fear/aggression are two distinct GWA loci within this LD block on chrX, but there 
      is almost perfect LD between the peaks for fear/aggression and animal size. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We have mapped many canine fear and aggression traits to single 
      haplotypes at the GNAT3-CD36 and IGSF1 loci. CD36 is widely expressed, but areas 
      of the amygdala and hypothalamus are among the brain regions with highest 
      enrichment; and CD36-knockout mice are known to have significantly increased 
      anxiety and aggression. Both of the other genes have very high tissue-specificity 
      and are very abundantly expressed in brain regions that comprise the core anatomy 
      of fear and aggression - the amygdala to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
      axis. We propose that reduced-fear variants at these loci may have been involved 
      in the domestication process.

      stress-related behaviors through the oxytocinergic system and HPA axis in mice.

AB  - Gestational stress can increase postpartum depression in women. To treat maternal 
      depression, fluoxetine (FLX) is most commonly prescribed. While FLX may be 
      effective for the mother, at high doses it may have adverse effects on the fetus. 
      As environmental enrichment (EE) can reduce maternal stress effects, we 
      hypothesized that a subthreshold dose of FLX increases the impact of EE to reduce 
      anxiety and depression-like behavior in postpartum dams exposed to gestational 
      stress. We evaluated this hypothesis in mice and to assess underlying mechanisms 
      we additionally measured hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and 
      brain levels of the hormone oxytocin, which are thought to be implicated in 
      postpartum depression. Gestational stress increased anxiety- and depression-like 
      behavior in postpartum dams. This was accompanied by an increase in HPA axis 
      function and a decrease in whole-brain oxytocin levels in dams. A combination of 
      FLX and EE remediated the behavioral, HPA axis and oxytocin changes induced by 
      gestational stress. Central administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist 
      prevented the remediating effect of FLX + EE, indicating that brain oxytocin 
      contributes to the effect of FLX + EE. These findings suggest that oxytocin is 
      causally involved in FLX + EE mediated remediation of postpartum stress-related 
      behaviors, and HPA axis function in postpartum dams.

TI  - Effect of simple and complex enrichment added to standard-sized cages in 
      behavioral, physiological, and neurological variables in female Swiss mice (Mus 
      musculus).

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been a widely used tool to improve animal 
      welfare, as well as to study brain plasticity. Traditional EE settings in the 
      field of neuroscience employ highly complex cages with numerous objects and 
      increased space, whereas more simple additions included for the control treatment 
      are rarely considered in the experimental design. This leads to a lack of 
      consistency of what neuroscientists designate as "standard housing," which might 
      compromise the reproducibility of the results. Therefore, we employed 
      standard-sized cages to study how different EE configurations can affect several 
      biological markers of animal welfare. We first compared barren cages with cages 
      containing nest material and a cardboard roll or cages having a complex set of 
      elements. For this purpose, we studied anxiety-like behavior, corticosterone 
      metabolites in feces, and cell survival in the hippocampus. Complex enrichment 
      (CE) increased the concentration of corticosterone metabolites while also 
      decreasing anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, both simple and CEs were able to 
      promote cell survival in the hippocampus, and this measure was positively 
      correlated to corticosterone metabolites. Furthermore, in a second experiment, 
      one of the elements of the CE was able to reduce anxiety-like behavior and blood 
      glucose reactivity after exposure to a stressful situation. Altogether, this 
      study calls attention about how sensitive experimental outcomes are to these 
      simple EE elements. Even though EE is recommended by most guidelines for the care 
      and use of laboratory animals, a detailed analysis of the EE protocol that is 
      going to be implemented is highly encouraged. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021

TI  - An epigenome-wide association study of posttraumatic stress disorder in US

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies using candidate gene and genome-wide approaches have 
      identified epigenetic changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: In this study, we performed an 
      EWAS of PTSD in a cohort of Veterans (n = 378 lifetime PTSD cases and 135 
      controls) from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders 
      (TRACTS) cohort assessed using the Illumina EPIC Methylation BeadChip which 
      assesses DNAm at more than 850,000 sites throughout the genome. Our model 
      included covariates for ancestry, cell heterogeneity, sex, age, and a smoking 
      score based on DNAm at 39 smoking-associated CpGs. We also examined in EPIC-based 
      DNAm data generated from pre-frontal cortex (PFC) tissue from the National PTSD 
      Brain Bank (n = 72). RESULTS: The analysis of blood samples yielded one 
      genome-wide significant association with PTSD at cg19534438 in the gene G0S2 
      (p = 1.19 × 10(-7), p(adj) = 0.048). This association was replicated in an 
      independent PGC-PTSD-EWAS consortium meta-analysis of military cohorts 
      (p = 0.0024). We also observed association with the smoking-related locus 
      cg05575921 in AHRR despite inclusion of a methylation-based smoking score 
      covariate (p = 9.16 × 10(-6)), which replicates a previously observed 
      PGC-PTSD-EWAS association (Smith et al. 2019), and yields evidence consistent 
      with a smoking-independent effect. The top 100 EWAS loci were then examined in 
      the PFC data. One of the blood-based PTSD loci, cg04130728 in CHST11, which was 
      in the top 10 loci in blood, but which was not genome-wide significant, was 
      significantly associated with PTSD in brain tissue (in blood p = 1.19 × 10(-5), 
      p(adj) = 0.60, in brain, p = 0.00032 with the same direction of effect). Gene set 
      enrichment analysis of the top 500 EWAS loci yielded several significant 
      overlapping GO terms involved in pathogen response, including "Response to 
      lipopolysaccharide" (p = 6.97 × 10(-6), p(adj) = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: The cross 
      replication observed in independent cohorts is evidence that DNA methylation in 
      peripheral tissue can yield consistent and replicable PTSD associations, and our 
      results also suggest that that some PTSD associations observed in peripheral 
      tissue may mirror associations in the brain.

AB  - This study shows the important link between higher drug use and self-medication 
      among youth with higher reported posttraumatic stress reactions after natural 
      disasters. The study offers secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected 
      on 170 predominately African American males through the Fifth Ward Enrichment 
      program (FWEP) in Houston, Texas, between November and December 2009. Men who 
      stated that in the last week they tried to keep from thinking or talking about 
      the hurricane or things that remind them of what happen were significantly more 
      likely to use alcohol (p < .05), marijuana (p < .01), codeine cough syrup (p < 
      .00), anti-energy drinks (p < .00), crystal methamphetamines (p < .00), and 
      Viagra (p < .00). Unadjusted logistic regression showed that they also 
      experienced over twice the odds of reporting past 30 day use of alcohol (OR = 
      2.57, 95% CI = .98, 6.8), marijuana (OR = 4.31, 95% CI = 1.2, 15.3), codeine 
      cough syrup (OR = 5.22, 95% CI = 1.4, 19.5), and anti-energy drinks (OR = 3.27, 
      95% CI = 1.0, 1.4). Adjusted logistic regression revealed that male youth 
      post-traumatic stress reaction is a significant predictor of marijuana use (OR = 
      4.1, 95% CI = 1.0, 16.5). This study shows the important link of higher drug use 
      and self-medication among youth with higher reported posttraumatic stress 
      reactions after natural disasters.

TI  - Interleukin-1β causes anxiety by interacting with the endocannabinoid system.
PG  - 13896-905
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1515-12.2012 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is involved in mood alterations associated with 
      inflammatory illnesses and with stress. The synaptic basis of IL-1β-induced 
      emotional disturbances is still unknown. To address the possible involvement of 
      the endocannabinoid system in IL-1β-induced anxiety, we performed behavioral and 
      neurophysiological studies in mice exposed to stress or to 
      intracerebroventricular injections of this inflammatory cytokine or of its 
      antagonist. We found that a single intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1β 
      caused anxiety in mice, and abrogated the sensitivity of cannabinoid CB1 
      receptors (CB1Rs) controlling GABA synapses in the striatum. Identical behavioral 
      and synaptic results were obtained following social defeat stress, and 
      intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1 receptor antagonist reverted both 
      effects. IL-1β-mediated inhibition of CB1R function was secondary to altered 
      cholesterol composition within membrane lipid rafts, and required intact function 
      of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, another element 
      of the endocannabinoid system. Membrane lipid raft disruption and inhibition of 
      cholesterol synthesis, in fact, abrogated IL-1β-CB1R coupling, and TRPV1-/- mice 
      were indeed insensitive to the synaptic and behavioral effects of both IL-1β and 
      stress. On the other hand, cholesterol enrichment of striatal slices mimicked the 
      synaptic effects of IL-1β on CB1Rs only in control mice, while the same treatment 
      was ineffective in slices prepared from TRPV1-/- mice. The present investigation 
      identifies a previously unrecognized interaction between a major proinflammatory 
      cytokine and the endocannabinoid system in the pathophysiology of anxiety.

TI  - Oligodendrocyte gene expression is reduced by and influences effects of chronic 
      social stress in mice.
PG  - e12475
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12475 [doi]
AB  - Oligodendrocyte gene expression is downregulated in stress-related 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. In mice, chronic social stress 
      (CSS) leads to depression-relevant changes in brain and emotional behavior, and 
      the present study shows the involvement of oligodendrocytes in this model. In 
      C57BL/6 (BL/6) mice, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted with prefrontal 
      cortex, amygdala and hippocampus from CSS and controls; a gene enrichment 
      database for neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes was used to identify cell 
      origin of deregulated genes, and cell deconvolution was applied. To assess the 
      potential causal contribution of reduced oligodendrocyte gene expression to CSS 
      effects, mice heterozygous for the oligodendrocyte gene cyclic nucleotide 
      phosphodiesterase (Cnp1) on a BL/6 background were studied; a 2 genotype 
      (wildtype, Cnp1(+/-) ) × 2 environment (control, CSS) design was used to 
      investigate effects on emotional behavior and amygdala microglia. In BL/6 mice, 
      in prefrontal cortex and amygdala tissue comprising gray and white matter, CSS 
      downregulated expression of multiple oligodendroycte genes encoding myelin and 
      myelin-axon-integrity proteins, and cell deconvolution identified a lower 
      proportion of oligodendrocytes in amygdala. Quantification of oligodendrocyte 
      proteins in amygdala gray matter did not yield evidence for reduced translation, 
      suggesting that CSS impacts primarily on white matter oligodendrocytes or the 
      myelin transcriptome. In Cnp1 mice, social interaction was reduced by CSS in 
      Cnp1(+/-) mice specifically; using ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 
      (IBA1) expression, microglia activity was increased additively by Cnp1(+/-) and 
      CSS in amygdala gray and white matter. This study provides back-translational 
      evidence that oligodendrocyte changes are relevant to the pathophysiology and 
      potentially the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

TI  - The Relationship between Personality Dimensions and Resiliency to Environmental 
      Stress in Orange-Winged Amazon Parrots (Amazona amazonica), as Indicated by the 
      Development of Abnormal Behaviors.
PG  - e0126170
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0126170 [doi]
LID - e0126170
AB  - Parrots are popular companion animals, but are frequently relinquished because of 
      behavioral problems, including abnormal repetitive behaviors like feather 
      damaging behavior and stereotypy. In addition to contributing to pet 
      relinquishment, these behaviors are important as potential indicators of 
      diminished psychological well-being. While abnormal behaviors are common in 
      captive animals, their presence and/or severity varies between animals of the 
      same species that are experiencing the same environmental conditions. Personality 
      differences could contribute to this observed individual variation, as they are 
      known risk factors for stress sensitivity and affective disorders in humans. The 
      goal of this study was to assess the relationship between personality and the 
      development and severity of abnormal behaviors in captive-bred orange-winged 
      Amazon parrots (Amazona amazonica). We monitored between-individual behavioral 
      differences in enrichment-reared parrots of known personality types before, 
      during, and after enrichment deprivation. We predicted that parrots with higher 
      scores for neurotic-like personality traits would be more susceptible to 
      enrichment deprivation and develop more abnormal behaviors. Our results partially 
      supported this hypothesis, but also showed that distinct personality dimensions 
      were related to different forms of abnormal behavior. While neuroticism-like 
      traits were linked to feather damaging behavior, extraversion-like traits were 
      negatively related to stereotypic behavior. More extraverted birds showed 
      resiliency to environmental stress, developing fewer stereotypies during 
      enrichment deprivation and showing lower levels of these behaviors following 
      re-enrichment. Our data, together with the results of the few studies conducted 
      on other species, suggest that, as in humans, certain personality types render 
      individual animals more susceptible or resilient to environmental stress. 
      Further, this susceptibility/resiliency can have a long-term effect on behavior, 
      as evidenced by behavioral changes that persisted despite re-enrichment. Ours is 
      the first study evaluating the relationship between personality dimensions, 
      environment, and abnormal behaviors in an avian species.

TI  - Effects of environmental enrichment on autonomic nervous activity in NSY mice.
PG  - 161-167
LID - 10.1538/expanim.19-0103 [doi]
AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) can reduce anxiety and stress in experimental 
      animals, while little is known about the influence on autonomic nervous activity 
      especially in disease animal models. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with 
      cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, which can be characterized by a higher 
      resting heart rate and a lower heart rate variability (HRV). We hypothesized that 
      EE can enhance parasympathetic nervous activity while reducing disease 
      progression in type 2 diabetic mice. A telemetry transmitter was implanted in NSY 
      mice to continuously record electrocardiograms (ECG). Animals were kept in a cage 
      with or without a nest box as EE. The autonomic nervous activity was evaluated 
      using power spectral analysis of HRV. Four weeks of EE could increase high 
      frequency (HF) power, but no change was observed in the absence of EE. Although 
      animals showed impaired glucose tolerance at 48 weeks of age regardless of EE, a 
      worsen case was observed in control. These results indicate that EE can be 
      necessary for long-term housing of experimental animals and may reduce the risk 
      of impaired glucose tolerance in NSY mice by enhancing parasympathetic nervous 
      activity. In future, it is demanded whether increasing parasympathetic nervous 
      activity, whatever the method is, can prevent diabetes from worsening.

TI  - Leading Innovative Practice: Leadership Attributes in LEAP Practices.
PG  - 399-445
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12456 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points An onslaught of policies from the federal government, states, the 
      insurance industry, and professional organizations continually requires primary 
      care practices to make substantial changes; however, ineffective leadership at 
      the practice level can impede the dissemination and scale-up of these policies. 
      The inability of primary care practice leadership to respond to ongoing policy 
      demands has resulted in moral distress and clinician burnout. Investments are 
      needed to develop interventions and educational opportunities that target a broad 
      array of leadership attributes. CONTEXT: Over the past several decades, health 
      care in the United States has undergone substantial and rapid change. At the 
      heart of this change is an assumption that a more robust primary care 
      infrastructure helps achieve the quadruple aim of improved care, better patient 
      experience, reduced cost, and improved work life of health care providers. 
      Practice-level leadership is essential to succeed in this rapidly changing 
      environment. Complex adaptive systems theory offers a lens for understanding 
      important leadership attributes. METHODS: A review of the literature on 
      leadership from a complex adaptive system perspective identified nine leadership 
      attributes hypothesized to support practice change: motivating others to engage 
      in change, managing abuse of power and social influence, assuring psychological 
      safety, enhancing communication and information sharing, generating a learning 
      organization, instilling a collective mind, cultivating teamwork, fostering 
      emergent leaders, and encouraging boundary spanning. Through a secondary 
      qualitative analysis, we applied these attributes to nine practices ranking high 
      on both a practice learning and leadership scale from the Learning from Effective 
      Ambulatory Practice (LEAP) project to see if and how these attributes manifest in 
      high-performing innovative practices. FINDINGS: We found all nine attributes 
      identified from the literature were evident and seemed important during a time of 
      change and innovation. We identified two additional attributes-anticipating the 
      future and developing formal processes-that we found to be important. Complexity 
      science suggests a hypothesized developmental model in which some attributes are 
      foundational and necessary for the emergence of others. CONCLUSIONS: Successful 
      primary care practices exhibit a diversity of strong local leadership attributes. 
      To meet the realities of a rapidly changing health care environment, training of 
      current and future primary care leaders needs to be more comprehensive and move 
      beyond motivating others and developing effective teams.

AB  - Antidepressant treatments enhance plasticity and increase neurogenesis in the 
      adult brain, but it has been unclear how these effects influence mood. We propose 
      that, like environmental enrichment and exercise, antidepressant treatments 
      enhance adaptability by increasing structural variability within the nervous 
      system at many levels, from proliferating precursors to immature synaptic 
      contacts. Conversely, sensory deprivation and chronic stress reduce this 
      structural variability. Activity-dependent competition within the mood-related 
      circuits, guided by rehabilitation, then selects for the survival and 
      stabilization of those structures that best represent the internal or external 
      milieu. Increased variability together with competition-mediated selection 
      facilitates normal function, such as pattern separation within the dentate gyrus 
      and other mood-related circuits, thereby enhancing adaptability toward novel 
      experiences.

AB  - We hypothesized that environmental enrichment in rats may reduce cocaine-seeking 
      behaviour elicited by cocaine-priming injections and by cocaine-associated cues. 
      Rats trained to self-administer cocaine while housed in isolated conditions were 
      then assigned to live in isolation or an enriched environment for 21 d of forced 
      abstinence. Subsequently, extinction and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking 
      behaviour (operant responses without cocaine available) were assessed. Expt 1 
      showed that enrichment resulted in less cocaine-seeking behaviour during 
      extinction and cue-elicited reinstatement compared to continued isolation 
      housing, but had no effect on cocaine-primed reinstatement. A subsequent 
      experiment, which included a pair-housed group to control for potential isolation 
      stress, again demonstrated that enrichment attenuated cocaine seeking during 
      extinction, but not cocaine-primed reinstatement, relative to both isolation and 
      pair-housed conditions. The findings suggest that enrichment reduces the impact 
      of cocaine-associated environmental stimuli, and hence it may be a useful 
      intervention for attenuating cue-elicited craving in humans.

TI  - 40 Hz Light Flicker Promotes Learning and Memory via Long Term Depression in 
      Wild-Type Mice.
PG  - 983-993

AB  - BACKGROUND: 40 Hz light flicker is a well-known non-invasive treatment that is 
      thought to be effective in treating Alzheimer's disease. However, the effects of 
      40 Hz visual stimulation on neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and learning 
      and memory in wild-type animals remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore 
      the impact of 40 Hz visual stimulation on synaptic plasticity, place cell, and 
      learning and memory in wild-type mice. METHODS: c-Fos+ cell distribution and in 
      vivo electrophysiology was used to explore the effects of 40 Hz chronic visual 
      stimulation on neural networks and neuroplasticity in wild-type mice. The 
      character of c-Fos+ distribution in the brain and the changes of corticosterone 
      levels in the blood were used to investigate the state of animal. Place cell 
      analysis and novel location test were utilized to examine the effects of 40 Hz 
      chronic visual stimulation on learning and memory in wild-type mice. RESULTS: We 
      found that 40 Hz light flicker significantly affected many brain regions that are 
      related to stress. Also, 40 Hz induced gamma enrichment within 15 min after light 
      flickers and impaired the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP), while 
      facilitated the expression of long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA1. 
      Furthermore, 40 Hz light flicker enhanced the expression of corticosterone, 
      rendered well-formed place cells unstable and improved animal's learning and 
      memory in novel local recognition test, which could be blocked by pre-treatment 
      with the LTD specific blocker Glu2A-3Y. CONCLUSION: These finding suggested that 
      40 Hz chronic light flicker contains stress effects, promoting learning and 
      memory in wild-type mice via LTD.

TI  - Dysregulation of miR-15a-5p, miR-497a-5p and miR-511-5p Is Associated with 
      Modulation of BDNF and FKBP5 in Brain Areas of PTSD-Related Susceptible and 
      Resilient Mice.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22105157 [doi]
LID - 5157
AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder occurring in 
      susceptible individuals following a traumatic event. Understanding the mechanisms 
      subserving trauma susceptibility/resilience is essential to develop new effective 
      treatments. Increasing evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs 
      (miRNAs), may play a prominent role in mediating trauma 
      susceptibility/resilience. In this study, we evaluated the transcriptional 
      expression of two key PTSD-related genes (FKBP5 and BDNF) and the relative 
      targeting miRNAs (miR-15a-5p, miR-497a-5p, miR-511-5p, let-7d-5p) in brain areas 
      of PTSD-related susceptible and resilient mice identified through our recently 
      developed mouse model of PTSD (arousal-based individual screening (AIS) model). 
      We observed lower transcript levels of miR-15a-5p, miR-497a-5p, and miR-511a-5p 
      in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of susceptible mice compared to resilient 
      mice, suggesting that the expression of these miRNAs could discriminate the two 
      different phenotypes of stress-exposed mice. These miRNA variations could 
      contribute, individually or synergically, to the inversely correlated transcript 
      levels of FKBP5 and BDNF. Conversely, in the medial prefrontal cortex, 
      downregulation of miR-15a-5p, miR-511-5p, and let-7d-5p was observed both in 
      susceptible and resilient mice, and not accompanied by changes in their mRNA 
      targets. Furthermore, miRNA expression in the different brain areas correlated to 
      stress-induced behavioral scores (arousal score, avoidance-like score, social 
      memory score and PTSD-like score), suggesting a linear connection between 
      miRNA-based epigenetic modulation and stress-induced phenotypes. Pathway analysis 
      of a miRNA network showed a statistically significant enrichment of molecular 
      processes related to PTSD and stress. In conclusion, our results indicate that 
      PTSD susceptibility/resilience might be shaped by brain-area-dependent modulation 
      of miRNAs targeting FKBP5, BDNF, and other stress-related genes.

      axis of the hippocampus.
PG  - 374-84
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.04.022 [doi]
AB  - The hippocampus is involved in both cognitive and emotional processing; these 
      different functions are topographically distributed along its septo-temporal 
      axis, the dorsal (septal) hippocampus being preferentially involved in cognitive 
      processes such as learning and memory while the ventral (temporal) hippocampus 
      participates in emotional regulation and anxiety-related behaviors. Newborn 
      hippocampal neurons become functionally integrated into hippocampal networks and 
      are likely to contribute to hippocampal functions, but whether their regulation 
      and function are homogenous throughout this axis is not clear. Here we 
      investigate changes in cell proliferation and neurogenesis along the 
      septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus induced by the Unpredictable Chronic Mild 
      Stress model of depression (UCMS), chronic fluoxetine treatment and enriched 
      environment. Mice were either subjected to UCMS, standard housing or enriched 
      environment. Stress-exposed mice were treated daily with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) or 
      vehicle. Effects of UCMS regimen, fluoxetine treatment and enrichment were 
      assessed by physical measures and behavioral testing. Quantitative changes in 
      cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed by immunohistochemistry using 
      BrdU labeling. Results indicate that UCMS decreased cell proliferation and 
      neurogenesis preferentially in the ventral hippocampus, an effect that was 
      reversed by fluoxetine treatment. Environmental enrichment on the other hand 
      increased cell proliferation in both divisions but promoted neurogenesis only in 
      the dorsal hippocampus. These results indicate that environmental factors can 
      differentially regulate neurogenesis in a region-specific manner. This may 
      possibly underlie heterogeneous function of newborn neurons along the 
      septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus and have functional significance as to 
      their implication in stress related disorders and memory processes.

AB  - Exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy in post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) patients relieves symptoms caused by fear association as well as symptoms 
      that are not the result of associative learning. We used the inescapable foot 
      shock model (IFS), an animal model for PTSD, to study the possible involvement of 
      glutamate receptors, the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system, and the 
      neuropeptide Y (NPY) system in the reduction of stress sensitization following 
      repeated re-exposure to the conditioning context. Starting one week after the IFS 
      procedure, the rats were repeatedly re-exposed to the shock environment. Stress 
      sensitivity was measured in a modified open field test (sudden silence was used 
      as a stressor). Selected mRNAs (GluN1, -2A-C, GluA1-4, GluK1-5, CRF, CRF-R1, NPY, 
      NPY-Y1) were quantified in the amygdala. Repeated re-exposure (RE) to the IFS 
      context reduced both trauma-associated anxiety (to the IFS context) and the 
      enhanced stress sensitivity (in the open field). Changes in glutamate receptor 
      subunits (GluN1, GluN2A-B, GluA1, GluA4, GluK3, GluK4) were detected in the 
      amygdala that were normalized by RE. However, infusion of the AMPA/kainate 
      antagonist NBQX in the BLA (basolateral amygdala) did not improve the anxious 
      behavior. RE normalized IFS-induced increases in CRF-R1 mRNA and increased NPY-Y1 
      mRNA expression in the amygdala. Previously, and repeated here, we showed that 
      environmental enrichment (EE) enhances recovery from IFS. EE led to similar 
      changes in CRF-R1 and NPY-Y1 expression as RE did. Importantly, administration of 
      [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY (Y1 agonist) in the BLA normalized the enhanced sensitivity to 
      stress after IFS. Our data suggest that the NPY-Y1 receptor in the amygdala may 
      serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of PTSD.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment is likely to influence fundamental biological processes 
      and engrave long-lasting epigenetic marks, leading to adverse health outcomes in 
      adulthood. We aimed to elucidate the impact of different early environment on 
      disease-related genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation in peripheral 
      blood cells in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compared with 
      the same trauma-exposed controls (n = 108), gene-expression profiles of PTSD 
      patients with similar clinical symptoms and matched adult trauma exposure but 
      different childhood adverse events (n = 32 and 29) were almost completely 
      nonoverlapping (98%). These differences on the level of individual transcripts 
      were paralleled by the enrichment of several distinct biological networks between 
      the groups. Moreover, these gene-expression changes were accompanied and likely 
      mediated by changes in DNA methylation in the same loci to a much larger 
      proportion in the childhood abuse (69%) vs. the non-child abuse-only group (34%). 
      This study is unique in providing genome-wide evidence of distinct biological 
      modifications in PTSD in the presence or absence of exposure to childhood abuse. 
      The findings that nonoverlapping biological pathways seem to be affected in the 
      two PTSD groups and that changes in DNA methylation appear to have a much greater 
      impact in the childhood-abuse group might reflect differences in the 
      pathophysiology of PTSD, in dependence of exposure to childhood maltreatment. 
      These results contribute to a better understanding of the extent of influence of 
      differences in trauma exposure on pathophysiological processes in stress-related 
      psychiatric disorders and may have implications for personalized medicine.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that 
      may develop after a traumatic event. Here we aimed to identify epigenetic and 
      genetic loci associated with PTSD. We included 73 traumatized police officers 
      with extreme phenotypes regarding symptom severity despite similar trauma 
      history: n = 34 had PTSD and n = 39 had minimal PTSD symptoms. Epigenetic and 
      genetic profiles were based on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We 
      searched for differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially 
      methylated regions (DMRs). For genetic associations we analyzed the CpG-SNPs 
      present on the array. We detected no genome-wide significant DMPs and we did not 
      replicate previously reported DMPs associated with PTSD. However, GSE analysis of 
      the top 100 DMPs showed enrichment of three genes involved in the dopaminergic 
      neurogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we observed a suggestive association of one 
      relatively large DMR between patients and controls, which was located at the PAX8 
      gene and previously associated with other psychiatric disorders. Finally, we 
      validated five PTSD-associated CpG-SNPs identified with the array using sanger 
      sequencing. We subsequently replicated the association of one common SNP 
      (rs1990322) in the CACNA1C locus with PTSD in an independent cohort of 
      traumatized children. The CACNA1C locus was previously associated with other 
      psychiatric disorders, but not yet with PTSD. Thus, despite the small sample 
      size, inclusion of extreme symptom severity phenotypes in a highly homogenous 
      traumatized cohort enabled detection of epigenetic and genetic loci associated 
      with PTSD. Moreover, here we showed that genetically confounded 450K probes are 
      informative for genetic association analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal welfare and accurate data collection are equally important in 
      rodent research. Housing influences study outcomes and can challenge studies that 
      monitor feeding, so housing choice needs to be evidence-based. The goal of these 
      studies was to (1) compare established measures of well-being between rodents 
      housed in wire grid-bottom floors with a resting platform compared to 
      solid-bottom floors with bedding and (2) determine whether presence of a chewable 
      device (Nylabone) affects orexin-A-induced hyperphagia. METHODS: Rodents were 
      crossed over to the alternate housing twice after 2-week periods. Time required 
      to complete food intake measurements was recorded as an indicator of feasibility. 
      Food intake stimulated by orexin-A was compared with and without the Nylabone. 
      Blood corticosterone and hypothalamic BDNF were assessed. RESULTS: Housing had no 
      effect on growth, energy expenditure, corticosterone, hypothalamic BDNF, 
      behavior, and anxiety measures. Food intake was disrupted after housing 
      cross-over. Time required to complete food intake measurements was significantly 
      higher for solid-bottom bedded cages. The Nylabone had no effect on 
      orexin-A-stimulated feeding. CONCLUSION: Well-being is not significantly 
      different between rodents housed on grid-bottom floors and those in 
      solid-bottom-bedded cages based on overall growth and feeding but alternating 
      between housing confounds measures of feeding.

AB  - Adverse environments during early life may lead to different neurophysiological 
      and behavioral consequences, including depression and learning and memory 
      deficits that persist into adulthood. Previously, we demonstrated that exposure 
      to an enriched environment during adolescence mitigates the cognitive impairment 
      observed after maternal separation in a task-specific manner. However, underlying 
      neural mechanisms are still not fully understood. The current study examines the 
      effects of neonatal maternal separation (MS) and postweaning environmental 
      enrichment (EE) on spatial learning and memory performance in a short version of 
      the Barnes Maze, active and passive behaviors in the forced swim test, and on 
      TrkB/BDNF receptor expression in the hippocampus. Our results revealed that MS 
      impaired acquisition learning and that enriched rats performed better than 
      non-enriched rats in acquisition trials, regardless of early conditions. During 
      the probe, enriched-housed rats demonstrated better performance than those reared 
      in standard conditions. No significant differences between groups were found in 
      the forced swim test. Both MS and EE increase full-length TrkB expression, and 
      the combination of MS and EE treatment caused the highest levels of this protein 
      expression. Similarly, truncated TrkB expression was higher in the MS/EE group. 
      Animal facility rearing (AFR) non-enriched groups present the lowest activation 
      of phosphorylated Erk, a canonical downstream kinase of TrkB signaling. Taken 
      together, our results demonstrate the importance of enriched environment as an 
      intervention to ameliorate the effects of maternal separation on spatial learning 
      and memory. TrkB/BDNF signaling could mediate neuroplastic changes related to 
      learning and memory during exposure to enriched environment.

      epigenetic therapy.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an incapacitating trauma-related 
      disorder, with no reliable therapy. Although PTSD has been associated with 
      epigenetic alterations in peripheral white blood cells, it is unknown where such 
      changes occur in the brain, and whether they play a causal role in PTSD. Using an 
      animal PTSD model, we show distinct DNA methylation profiles of PTSD 
      susceptibility in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Data analysis revealed overall 
      hypomethylation of different genomic CG sites in susceptible animals. This was 
      correlated with the reduction in expression levels of the DNA methyltransferase, 
      DNMT3a. Since epigenetic changes in diseases involve different gene pathways, 
      rather than single candidate genes, we next searched for pathways that may be 
      involved in PTSD. Analysis of differentially methylated sites identified 
      enrichment in the RAR activation and LXR/RXR activation pathways that regulate 
      Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Related Orphan Receptor A (RORA) activation. 
      Intra-NAc injection of a lentiviral vector expressing either RORA or DNMT3a 
      reversed PTSD-like behaviors while knockdown of RORA and DNMT3a increased 
      PTSD-like behaviors. To translate our results into a potential pharmacological 
      therapeutic strategy, we tested the effect of systemic treatment with the global 
      methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), for supplementing DNA methylation, or 
      retinoic acid, for activating RORA downstream pathways. We found that combined 
      treatment with the methyl donor SAM and retinoic acid reversed PTSD-like 
      behaviors. Thus, our data point to a novel approach to the treatment of PTSD, 
      which is potentially translatable to humans.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has been studied as a protocol that can improve 
      brain plasticity and may protect against negative insults such as chronic stress. 
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of EE on the hormonal and 
      behavioral responses induced by chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMS) in rats, 
      considering the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system. Male adult rats were 
      divided into 4 groups: control, CMS, EE, and CMS + EE, and the experimental 
      protocol lasted for 7 weeks. EE was performed during 7 weeks, 5 days per week, 
      2 h per day. CMS was applied during weeks 3, 4, and 5. After the CMS (week 6), 
      depression-like behavior was evaluated by forced swimming and sucrose consumption 
      tests, anxiety level was evaluated using the elevated plus-maze test, and memory 
      was evaluated using the Y-maze test. On week 7, the animals were euthanized and 
      basal plasma levels of corticosterone and catecholamines were determined. The 
      hypothalamus was isolated and tissue levels of angiotensin peptides were 
      evaluated. CMS increased plasma corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine 
      basal concentrations, induced depression-like behaviors, impaired memory, and 
      increased hypothalamic angiotensin I, II, and IV concentrations. EE decreased 
      stress hormones secretion, depression-like behaviors, memory impairment, and 
      hypothalamic angiotensin II induced by stress. Reductions of anxiety-like 
      behavior and norepinephrine secretion were observed in both stressed and 
      unstressed groups. The results indicated that EE seemed to protect adult rats 
      against hormonal and behavioral CMS effects, and that the reduction of 
      angiotensin II could contribute to these effects.

TI  - Attachment Style Moderates Polygenic Risk for Incident Posttraumatic Stress in 
      U.S. Military Veterans: A 7-Year, Nationally Representative, Prospective Cohort 
      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops consequent to complex 
      gene-by-environment interactions beyond the precipitating trauma. To date, 
      however, no known study has used a prospective design to examine how polygenic 
      risk scores (PRSs) interact with social-environmental factors such as attachment 
      style to predict PTSD development. METHODS: PRSs were derived from a genome-wide 
      association study of PTSD symptoms (N = 186,689; Million Veteran Program cohort). 
      We evaluated combined effects of PRS and attachment style in predicting incident 
      PTSD in a 7-year, nationally representative cohort of trauma-exposed, 
      European-American U.S. military veterans without PTSD (N = 1083). We also 
      conducted multivariate gene-by-environment interaction and drug repositioning 
      analyses to identify loci that interact with multiple environmental factors and 
      potential pharmacotherapies that may be repurposed for this disorder. RESULTS: 
      Veterans with higher PTSD PRS were more likely to have an incident-positive 
      screen for PTSD over 7 years. A gene-by-environment interaction was also 
      observed, such that higher PRS only predicted incident PTSD in veterans with an 
      insecure attachment style and not those with a secure attachment style. At an 
      individual locus level, the strongest gene-by-environment interaction was 
      observed for the rs4702 variant of the FURIN gene with cumulative lifetime trauma 
      burden. Drug repositioning revealed that genes implicated in PRS are perturbated 
      by the drug doxylamine. CONCLUSIONS: Attachment style moderates polygenic risk 
      for the development of PTSD in European-American veterans. These findings may 
      inform PTSD prevention and treatment for veterans with high polygenic risk for 
      PTSD and suggest a potential pharmacotherapeutic target for risk genes moderated 
      by social-environmental factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is primarily a mental 
      disorder, it can cause additional symptoms that do not seem to be directly 
      related to the central nervous system, which PTSD is assumed to directly affect. 
      PTSD-mediated heart diseases are some of such secondary disorders. In spite of 
      the significant correlations between PTSD and heart diseases, spatial separation 
      between the heart and brain (where PTSD is primarily active) prevents researchers 
      from elucidating the mechanisms that bridge the two disorders. Our purpose was to 
      identify genes linking PTSD and heart diseases. METHODS: In this study, gene 
      expression profiles of various murine tissues observed under various types of 
      stress or without stress were analyzed in an integrated manner using tensor 
      decomposition (TD). RESULTS: Based upon the obtained features, ∼ 400 genes were 
      identified as candidate genes that may mediate heart diseases associated with 
      PTSD. Various gene enrichment analyses supported biological reliability of the 
      identified genes. Ten genes encoding protein-, DNA-, or mRNA-interacting 
      proteins-ILF2, ILF3, ESR1, ESR2, RAD21, HTT, ATF2, NR3C1, TP53, and TP63-were 
      found to be likely to regulate expression of most of these ∼ 400 genes and 
      therefore are candidate primary genes that cause PTSD-mediated heart diseases. 
      Approximately 400 genes in the heart were also found to be strongly affected by 
      various drugs whose known adverse effects are related to heart diseases and/or 
      fear memory conditioning; these data support the reliability of our findings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TD-based unsupervised feature extraction turned out to be a useful 
      method for gene selection and successfully identified possible genes causing 
      PTSD-mediated heart diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prenatal stress (PS) can cause depression in offspring. However, 
      the underlying biological mechanism of these influences is still unclear. This 
      work was implemented to investigate the molecular mechanisms of depressive-like 
      behavior of offspring rats insulted with PS. METHODS: Relative quantitative 
      phosphoproteomics of the hippocampus of PS susceptibility (PS-S) and control 
      (CON) rat offspring was performed using  liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry to confirm known pathways and to identify new mechanisms involved in 
      depression. RESULTS: A total of 6790 phosphopeptides, 9817 phosphorylation sites, 
      and 2978 phosphoproteins were detected. Among the 2978 phosphoproteins, 1760 
      (59.09%) had more than two phosphorylated sites, the ENSRNOP00000023460 protein 
      had more than 117 phosphorylated sites, and the average distribution of 
      modification sites per 100 amino acids was 2.97. There were 197 different 
      phosphopeptides, including 140 increased phosphopeptides and 57 decreased 
      phosphopeptides in the PS-S offspring rats, compared to the CON offspring rats. 
      These differential phosphopeptides corresponded to 100 upregulated and 44 
      downregulated phosphoproteins, respectively. Gene ontology enrichment analysis 
      revealed that these different phosphoproteins in the top five enriched terms in 
      the cellular component, molecular function, and biological proces categories were 
      involved in a total of 35 different phosphoproteins, and these phosphoproteins 
      were mainly related to myelin-, microtubule- and synapse-associated proteins. The 
      enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways was found to be 
      involved in many essential biological pathways, and the top five pathways 
      included amphetamine addiction, insulin secretion, Cushing syndrome, and the 
      circadian entrainment signaling pathway. These first five pathways were related 
      to nine phosphoproteins, including Adcy9, Apc, Cacna1c, Camk2a, Camk2b, Camk2g, 
      Ctnnd2, Grin2a, and Stx1a. The full data are available via ProteomeXchange with 
      identifier PXD019117. CONCLUSION: We preliminarily identified 144 different 
      phosphoproteins involved in myelin, microtubule, and synapse formation and 
      plasticity in the hippocampus of susceptible offspring rats exposed to PS.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (ahNG) occurs in the human brain. Adult generated 
      neurons have been proposed to functionally contribute to relevant hippocampal 
      functions such as learning and memory, mood regulation, and stress response. 
      Learning, environmental enrichment, and physical exercise exert positive effects 
      on ahNG. In parallel, these proneurogenic stimuli have been shown to ameliorate 
      cognitive performance and/or depressive-like behavior in animal models. 
      Conversely, aging, social isolation, and chronic stress exert negative effects on 
      ahNG. Interestingly, reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis is suggested to 
      potentially contribute to cognitive decline and mood alterations associated with 
      aging and several neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical observation demonstrates 
      that patients affected by chronic pain often exhibit increased anxiety and 
      depression, impaired cognitive flexibility, and memory capacities. As of today, 
      our understanding of the molecular and cellular events that may underlie the 
      comorbidity of chronic pain, depression, and cognitive impairment is limited. 
      Herein we review recent preclinical data suggesting that chronic pain may induce 
      profound changes in hippocampal plasticity, including reduced ahNG. We discuss 
      the possibility that deregulated hippocampal neurogenesis in chronic pain may, at 
      least in part, contribute to cognitive and mood alterations. Based on this 
      hypothesis, the mechanisms underlying chronic pain-associated changes in 
      hippocampal neurogenesis and related functions need to be addressed 
      experimentally. One interesting feature of ahNG is its susceptibility to 
      pharmacological modulation. Again, based on preclinical data we discuss the 
      possibility that, at least in principle, distinct analgesic drugs commonly used 
      in chronic pain states (typical and atypical opiates, α2δ ligands, and 
      acetyl-l-carnitine) may differentially impact ahNG and that this aspect could be 
      taken into account to reduce and/or prevent the potential risk of cognitive and 
      emotional side effects in the clinical setting.

AB  - Environmental factors such as stress drive the development of drug addiction in 
      genetically vulnerable individuals; the genes underlying this vulnerability are 
      unknown. One strategy for uncovering these genes is to study the impact of 
      environmental manipulation on high-throughput phenotypes that predict drug use 
      and addiction-like behaviors. In the present study, we assessed the viability of 
      this approach by evaluating the relative effects of environmental enrichment and 
      isolation housing on three high-throughput phenotypes known to predict variation 
      on distinct aspects of intravenous drug self-administration. Prior to behavioral 
      testing, male and female C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice (BXD founders) were housed in 
      enrichment or isolation for ten weeks beginning at weaning. Enrichment 
      significantly reduced novelty reactivity; this effect was significantly more 
      robust in C57BL/6J mice relative to DBA/2J mice. Enrichment significantly reduced 
      novelty preference; this effect was significantly dependent on novel environment 
      characteristics and was significantly more robust in DBA/2J mice relative to 
      C57BL/6J mice. Enrichment significantly increased anxiety; this effect was not 
      strain-dependent. Collectively, these data indicate that (1) environmental 
      enrichment influences novelty reactivity, novelty preference, and anxiety via 
      distinct genetic mechanisms in mice, and (2) the BXD panel can be used to 
      discover the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

TI  - Short Daily Exposure to Environmental Enrichment, Fluoxetine, or Their 
      Combination Reverses Deterioration of the Coat and Anhedonia Behaviors with 
      Differential Effects on Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Chronically Stressed Mice.

AB  - Depression is a neuropsychiatric disorder with a high impact on the worldwide 
      population. To overcome depression, antidepressant drugs are the first line of 
      treatment. However, pre-clinical studies have pointed out that antidepressants 
      are not entirely efficacious and that the quality of the living environment after 
      stress cessation may play a relevant role in increasing their efficacy. As it is 
      unknown whether a short daily exposure to environmental enrichment during chronic 
      stress and antidepressant treatment will be more effective than just the 
      pharmacological treatment, this study analyzed the effects of fluoxetine, 
      environmental enrichment, and their combination on depressive-associated 
      behavior. Additionally, we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed 
      to chronic mild stress. Our results indicate that fluoxetine reversed anhedonia. 
      Besides, fluoxetine reversed the decrement of some events of the hippocampal 
      neurogenic process caused by chronic mild stress. Conversely, short daily 
      exposure to environmental enrichment changed the deterioration of the coat and 
      anhedonia. Although, this environmental intervention did not produce significant 
      changes in the neurogenic process affected by chronic mild stress, fluoxetine 
      plus environmental enrichment showed similar effects to those caused by 
      environmental enrichment to reverse depressive-like behaviors. Like fluoxetine, 
      the combination reversed the declining number of Ki67, doublecortin, calretinin 
      cells and mature newborn neurons. Finally, this study suggests that short daily 
      exposure to environmental enrichment improves the effects of fluoxetine to 
      reverse the deterioration of the coat and anhedonia in chronically stressed mice. 
      In addition, the combination of fluoxetine with environmental enrichment produces 
      more significant effects than those caused by fluoxetine alone on some events of 
      the neurogenic process. Thus, environmental enrichment improves the benefits of 
      pharmacological treatment by mechanisms that need to be clarified.

AB  - Social stressors produce neurobiological and emotional consequences in social 
      species. Environmental interventions, such as environmental enrichment and 
      exercise, may modulate physiological and behavioral stress responses. The present 
      study investigated the benefits of environmental enrichment and exercise against 
      social stress in the socially monogamous prairie vole. Female prairie voles 
      remained paired with a sibling (control) or were isolated from a sibling for 
      4 weeks. The isolated groups were assigned to isolated sedentary, isolated with 
      environmental enrichment, or isolated with both enrichment and exercise 
      conditions. Behaviors related to depression, anxiety, and sociality were 
      investigated using the forced swim test (FST), elevated plus maze (EPM), and a 
      social crowding stressor (SCS), respectively. cFos expression was evaluated in 
      stress-related circuitry following the SCS. Both enrichment and enrichment with 
      exercise protected against depression-relevant behaviors in the FST and social 
      behavioral disruptions in the SCS, but only enrichment with exercise protected 
      against anxiety-related behaviors in the EPM and altered cFos expression in the 
      hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in isolated prairie voles. Enrichment may 
      improve emotion-related and social behaviors, however physical exercise may be an 
      important component of environmental strategies for protecting against 
      anxiety-related behaviors and reducing neural activation as a function of social 
      stress.

TI  - Nitrous oxide sedation: understanding the benefits and risks.
PG  - 47-50
AB  - Nitrous oxide and oxygen is widely used for conscious sedation in dental offices. 
      It can have benefits for patients who experience dental anxiety or are medically 
      compromised and gain from the oxygen enrichment and stress reduction. Clinicians 
      benefit when patients are cooperative and satisfied. There are a few patients for 
      whom nitrous oxide would not be an optimum therapy. Chronic occupational exposure 
      to low levels of nitrous oxide has several reproductive and health risks. 
      Reducing the ambient concentrations is important.

AB  - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that develops in 
      individuals experiencing a shocking incident, but the underlying disease 
      susceptibility gene networks remain poorly understood. Breen et al. conducted a 
      Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis on PTSD, and identified a 
      dysregulated innate immune module associated with PTSD development. To further 
      identify the Master Regulators (MRs) driving the network function, here we 
      deconvoluted the transcriptional networks on the same datasets using ARACNe 
      (Algorithm for Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) followed by protein 
      activity analysis. We successfully identified several MRs including SOX3, 
      TNFAIP3, TRAFD1, POU3F3, STAT2, and PML that govern the expression of a large 
      collection of genes. Transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis 
      verified the binding of these MRs to their predicted targets. Notably, the 
      sub-networks regulated by TNFAIP3, TRAFD1 and PML are involved in innate immune 
      response, suggesting that these MRs may correlate with the innate immune module 
      identified by Breen et al. These findings were replicated in an independent 
      dataset generated on expression microarrays. In conclusion, our analysis 
      corroborated previous findings that innate immunity may be involved in the 
      progression of PTSD, yet also identified candidate MRs driving the disease 
      progression in the innate immunity pathways.

AB  - Discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis has led to proposed microbe-based 
      therapeutic strategies in mental health, including the use of mood-altering 
      bacterial species, termed psychobiotics. However, we still have limited 
      understanding of the key signaling pathways engaged by specific organisms in 
      modulating brain function, and evidence suggests that bacteria with broadly 
      similar neuroactive and immunomodulatory actions can drive different behavioral 
      outcomes. We sought to identify pathways distinguishing two psychoactive 
      bacterial strains that seemingly engage similar gut-brain signaling pathways but 
      have distinct effects on behaviour. We used RNAseq to identify mRNAs 
      differentially expressed in the blood and hippocampus of mice following 
      Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus JB-1, and Limosilactobacillus reuteri 6475 treatment 
      and performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify enrichment in 
      pathway activity. L. rhamnosus, but not L. reuteri treatment altered several 
      pathways in the blood and hippocampus, and the rhamnosus could be clearly 
      distinguished based on mRNA profile. In particular, L. rhamnosus treatment 
      modulated the activity of interferon signaling, JAK/STAT, and TNF-alpha via NF-KB 
      pathways. Our results highlight that psychobiotics can induce complex changes in 
      host gene expression, andin understanding these changes, we may help fine-tune 
      selection of psychobiotics for treating mood disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a polygenic disorder 
      characterized principally by dysregulated inflammation impacting the 
      gastrointestinal tract. However, there also is increasing evidence for a clinical 
      association with stress and depression. Given the role of the hypothalamus in 
      stress responses and in the pathogenesis of depression, useful insights could be 
      gleaned from understanding its genetic role in IBD. METHODS: We conducted genetic 
      correlation analyses on publicly available genome-wide association study summary 
      statistics for depression and IBD traits to identify genetic commonalities. We 
      used partitioned linkage disequilibrium score regression, leveraging our ATAC 
      sequencing and promoter-focused Capture C data, to measure enrichment of IBD 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms within promoter-interacting open chromatin 
      regions of human embryonic stem cell-derived hypothalamic-like neurons (HNs). 
      Using the same data sets, we performed variant-to-gene mapping to implicate 
      putative IBD effector genes in HNs. To contrast these results, we similarly 
      analyzed 3-dimensional genomic data generated in epithelium-derived colonoids 
      from rectal biopsy specimens from donors without pathologic disease noted at the 
      time of colonoscopy. Finally, we conducted enrichment pathway analyses on the 
      implicated genes to identify putative IBD dysfunctional pathways. RESULTS: We 
      found significant genetic correlations (rg) of 0.122 with an adjusted P 
      (P(adj)) = 1.4 × 10(-4) for IBD: rg = 0.122; P(adj) = 2.5 × 10(-3) for ulcerative 
      colitis and genetic correlation (rg) = 0.094; P(adj) = 2.5 × 10(-3) for Crohn's 
      disease, and significant approximately 4-fold (P = .005) and approximately 7-fold 
      (P = .03) enrichment of IBD single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HNs and colonoids, 
      respectively. We implicated 25 associated genes in HNs, among which CREM, CNTF, 
      and RHOA encode key regulators of stress. Seven genes also additionally were 
      implicated in the colonoids. We observed an overall enrichment for immune and 
      hormonal signaling pathways, and a colonoid-specific enrichment for 
      microbiota-relevant terms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the hypothalamus 
      warrants further study in the context of IBD pathogenesis.

TI  - Concerted Cultivation and Adolescent Psychopathology over Time-Mediation of 
      Parent-Child Conflict.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17249173 [doi]
LID - 9173
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerted cultivation is a parenting strategy that parents nurture 
      their children intensively by involving heavily in their children's academic 
      sphere as well as offering them different structured "enrichment" activities so 
      that their children can succeed in the future competitive "rug rat race". While 
      this parenting strategy has been regarded as an effective strategy to promote 
      child and adolescent development, it is deemed to create stress and anxiety for 
      their children. The present study examined the relationship between concerted 
      cultivation and adolescent psychopathology (indexed by depression and anxiety) 
      via parent-child conflict among Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong over time. 
      METHOD: A sample of 1570 young adolescents (48.5% girls, mean age at time 1 = 
      12.6, SD = 0.76) were recruited from 19 secondary schools in Hong Kong. 
      Adolescents were invited to fill out a questionnaire that contained measures of 
      concerted cultivation, parent-child conflict, anxiety and depression in two 
      consecutive years. RESULTS: Results from structural equation modeling showed that 
      higher levels of paternal concerted cultivation were associated with higher 
      levels of adolescent psychopathology via increased father-child conflict over 
      time. However, maternal concerted cultivation was linked to greater mother-child 
      conflict but reduced father-child conflict, which was associated with adolescent 
      psychopathology. DISCUSSION: Rather than regarding concerted cultivation as an 
      effective parenting strategy that promotes adolescent development, the findings 
      indicated that concerted cultivation increased adolescent psychopathology via 
      increased parent-child conflict. The study sheds new light for family 
      practitioners and educators in their awareness of the adverse effects of 
      concerted cultivation and designing appropriate parent education programs for 
      parents.

AB  - Stressful life events are major environmental risk factors for anxiety disorders, 
      although not all individuals exposed to stress develop clinical anxiety. The 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of environmental effects on anxiety 
      are largely unknown. To identify biological pathways mediating stress-related 
      anxiety and resilience to it, we used the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) 
      paradigm in male mice of two inbred strains, C57BL/6NCrl (B6) and DBA/2NCrl (D2), 
      that differ in their susceptibility to stress. Using a multi-omics approach, we 
      identified differential mRNA, miRNA and protein expression changes in the bed 
      nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and blood cells after chronic stress. 
      Integrative gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of 
      mitochondrial-related genes in the BNST and blood of stressed mice. To translate 
      these results to human anxiety, we investigated blood gene expression changes 
      associated with exposure-induced panic attacks. Remarkably, we found reduced 
      expression of mitochondrial-related genes in D2 stress-susceptible mice and in 
      exposure-induced panic attacks in humans, but increased expression of these genes 
      in B6 stress-susceptible mice. Moreover, stress-susceptible vs. stress-resilient 
      B6 mice displayed more mitochondrial cross-sections in the post-synaptic 
      compartment after CSDS. Our findings demonstrate mitochondrial-related 
      alterations in gene expression as an evolutionarily conserved response in 
      stress-related behaviors and validate the use of cross-species approaches in 
      investigating the biological mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders.

TI  - Selecting antidepressants according to a drug-by-environment interaction: A 
      comparison of fluoxetine and minocycline effects in mice living either in 
      enriched or stressful conditions.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for 
      major depressive disorder. It has been recently proposed that these drugs, by 
      enhancing neural plasticity, amplify the influences of the living conditions on 
      mood. Consequently, SSRI outcome depends on the quality of the environment, 
      improving symptomatology mainly in individuals living in favorable conditions. In 
      adverse conditions, drugs with a different mechanism of action might have higher 
      efficacy. The antibiotic minocycline, with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory 
      properties, has been recently proposed as a novel potential antidepressant 
      treatment. To explore the drug-by-environment interaction, we compared the 
      effects on depressive-like behavior and neural plasticity of the SSRI fluoxetine 
      and minocycline in enriched and stressful conditions. We first exposed C57BL/6 
      adult female mice to 14 days of chronic unpredictable mild stress to induce a 
      depressive-like profile. Afterward, mice received vehicle, fluoxetine, or 
      minocycline for 21 days, while exposed to either enriched or stressful 
      conditions. During the first five days, fluoxetine led to an improvement in 
      enrichment but not in stress. By contrast, minocycline led to an improvement in 
      both conditions. After 21 days, all groups showed a significant improvement in 
      enrichment while fluoxetine worsened the depressive like behavior in stress. The 
      effects of the drugs on neural plasticity, measured as long-term potentiation, 
      were also environment-dependent. Overall, we show that the environment affects 
      fluoxetine but not minocycline outcome, indicating that the latter represents a 
      potential alternative to SSRIs to treat depressed patients living in adverse 
      conditions. From a translation perspective, our finding call for considering the 
      drug-by-environment interaction to select the most effective pharmacological 
      treatment.

AB  - Treatments for endometriosis include pharmacological or surgical procedures that 
      produce significant side effects. We aimed to determine how environmental 
      enrichment (EE) could impact the progression of endometriosis using the 
      autotransplantation rat model. Female rats were exposed to EE (endo-EE: toys and 
      nesting materials, 4 rats per cage, larger area enclosure) or no enrichment 
      (endo-NE: 2 rats per cage) starting on postnatal day 21. After 8 weeks, sham 
      surgery or surgical endometriosis was induced by suturing uterine horn tissue 
      next to the intestinal mesentery, then allowed to progress for 60 days during 
      which EE or NE continued. At the time of killing, we measured anxiety behaviors, 
      collected endometriotic vesicles and uterus, and processed for quantitative 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), 
      urocortin-1, CRH receptors type 1 and type 2, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 
      Endometriosis did not affect anxiety-like behaviors, yet rats in enriched 
      conditions showed lower basal anxiety behaviors than the nonenriched group. 
      Importantly, the endo-EE group showed a 28% reduction in the number of 
      endometriosis vesicles and the vesicles were significantly smaller compared to 
      the endo-NE group. Endometriosis increased CRH and GR only in the vesicles of 
      endo-NE, and this increase was dampened in the endo-EE. However, urocortin 1 was 
      increased in the vesicles of the endo-EE group, suggesting different pathways of 
      activation of CRH receptors in this group. Our results suggest that the use of 
      multimodal complementary therapies that reduce stress in endometriosis could be 
      an effective and safe treatment alternative, with minimal side effects.

TI  - Concurrent environmental enrichment and chronic restraint stress: Effects on 
      innate anxiety and depressive-like behavior in male adolescent mice.
PG  - 730-736
LID - 10.1002/jdn.10061 [doi]
AB  - Adolescence is a period that exhibits both vulnerability and adaptation to 
      environmental stimulus. This study explored the co-existence effect of 
      environmental enrichment (EE) and restraint stress (RS) on innate anxiety and 
      depressive-like behavior in adolescent mice. Male ICR mice were treated with 
      daily EE and RS (4 h/d or 8 h/d) for 2 or 4 weeks from early adolescence 
      (postnatal day 30) and emotional behaviors were evaluated 24 h after the end of 
      treatment. 4 weeks of 8 h RS treatment decreased immobility time in forced 
      swimming test, demonstrating an antidepressant-like effect. For 2 weeks of 
      treatment, 8 h RS significantly reduced the time spent in the lighted compartment 
      of the light-dark box, indicating an increased anxiety level. These results show 
      that under the present experimental design, RS treatment with different duration 
      could have different effect on mice emotion-related behavior, but there was no 
      interaction between EE and RS.

TI  - Effects of post-weaning social isolation and environment al enrichment on 
      exploratory behavior and ankiety in Wistar rats.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - Adverse early experience is generally regarded as a risk factor for both 
      externalizing and internalizing behavioral disorders in humans. It can be modeled 
      in rats by a post-weaning social isolation procedure. Effects of social isolation 
      might possibly be ameliorated by environmental enrichment. In the current study, 
      24 male Wistar rats were divided post-weaning into four rearing conditions: 
      control, environmental enrichment (EE), social isolation (SI) and a combination 
      of the two experimental conditions; (EE+SI). Two observations of the effects of 
      rearing conditions on the rate of social and object interactions were conducted 
      during the juvenile and post-pubertal stages of development. The SI condition led 
      to a marked increase of social interactions during the juvenile phase, but did 
      not affect object interactions. The EE condition increased the level of social 
      interactions during both the juvenile and post-pubertal measurements. The effects 
      of early rearing conditions on adult exploratory behavior were less clear, with a 
      significant difference between the groups obtained in one of three behavioral 
      tests. Results suggest a general robustness in the development of adult 
      exploratory behavior and anxiety when rats were exposed to early social isolation 
      and provided brief opportunities for social play during the juvenile period. 
      Further studies, aimed at distinguishing play-related protective factors serving 
      against long-term adverse effects of juvenile social isolation, are suggested.

TI  - Effects of environmental enrichment and regrouping on natural 
      autoantibodies-binding danger and neural antigens in healthy pigs with different 
      individual characteristics.

AB  - Pigs living in commercial husbandry systems may experience both acute stress due 
      to standard management procedures and chronic stress through limitations in their 
      barren housing environment. This might influence their immune status, including 
      antibody responses to neural and danger autoantigens. Levels of natural 
      autoantibody (NAAb)-binding phosphorylcholine-conjugated bovine serum albumin 
      (PC-BSA) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were measured over time in pigs that were 
      kept in environmental enriched v. barren housing, and that underwent a regrouping 
      test. In total, 480 pigs were housed in 80 pens in either barren or 
      straw-enriched pens from 4 through 23 weeks of age. Blood samples were taken from 
      pigs before (week 8), and 3 days after a 24 h regrouping test (week 9), and at 22 
      weeks of age. Phosphorylcholine-conjugated bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) and MBP 
      antibody titres in serum were measured using ELISA. Enriched-housed pigs had 
      higher levels of IgM-binding MBP, and tended to have higher levels of IgG-binding 
      MBP and IgA-binding PC-BSA than barren-housed pigs. Each NAAb measured in this 
      study was affected by gender and litter. These results suggest that enriched 
      housing conditions, as well as acute regrouping stress, have an influence on 
      levels of serum NAAb-binding danger and neural antigens in pigs.

AB  - Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity, affecting a person's 
      thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings and sense of well-being, which is 
      associated with dramatical gene expression changes in hippocampus. Rodents 
      induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) demonstrate typical 
      depression-like behaviors similar to clinical patients, therefore, are commonly 
      used as a model for depression and antidepressant study. In order to enhance our 
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of depression, in 
      the present study, the hippocampal mRNA expression profile of mice exposed to 
      CUMS for 5 weeks was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform followed by 
      enrichment analysis, including Hierarchical Cluster, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
      and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. 
      Totally, 346 differently expressed mRNAs, including 208 downregulated and 138 
      upregulated, were identified in the hippocampus of the CUMS mice. KEGG biological 
      pathway analysis showed that the upregulated and downregulated mRNAs were mostly 
      enriched in 29 pathways and 8 pathways, respectively. PPI network analysis 
      exposed that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was the crucial node with 
      high connectivity degree. Additionally, most of these genes in PPI network 
      analysis have previously been linked to energy metabolism and corticosterone 
      responses. Overall, our results indicate the possible novel molecular targets for 
      the therapy of depression.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a widely used treatment for neurodegenerative 
      disorders like Parkinson's disease. Recently, several studies have used 
      preclinical animal models to suggest that DBS has a potential to improve 
      emotional symptoms in mental disorders such as treatment-resistant depression and 
      post-traumatic stress disorder. An important difference between neurodegenerative 
      and emotional disorders is the crucial role of environment in the ontogeny of the 
      latter. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of DBS in the context of 
      environmental variation. In this study, we show that DBS of ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortex reduces anxiety in rats when it is coupled with simultaneous 
      exposure to an enriched environment (EE). In contrast, effects of DBS on 
      anxiety-like behaviors remained equivocal when animals were housed in standard 
      laboratory conditions. These results suggest that the ability of DBS to treat 
      anxiety and related phenotypes can be significantly enhanced by EE opportunities.

TI  - Polygenic risk for traumatic loss-related PTSD in US military veterans: 
      Protective effect of secure attachment style.
PG  - 792-799
LID - 10.1080/15622975.2021.1907721 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether attachment style moderates the relationship 
      between polygenic risk scores (PRS) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
      re-experiencing (PTSD(REX)) symptoms and the severity of and positive screen for 
      traumatic loss-related PTSD. METHODS: Data were analysed from 631 US veterans who 
      endorsed 'unexpected death of a loved one' as their 'worst' traumatic event. 
      Multivariable models evaluated the association between PRS for PTSD(REX,) 
      attachment style, and their interaction in predicting severity and positive 
      screen for PTSD. A gene enrichment analysis was conducted to identify possible 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the association between PTSD(REX) PRS and PTSD. 
      RESULTS: PTSD(REX) PRS (β = 0.17; odds ratio [OR] = 1.85), attachment style (β= 
      -0.33; OR = 0.14), and PTSD(REX) PRS × attachment style interaction (β= -0.12; OR 
      = 0.53) were significant predictors of the severity and positive screen for PTSD. 
      The most significant gene set detected was the gene ontology (GO) cellular 
      component podosome set (GO:0002102, p < 3.95 × 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: Having a 
      secure attachment style may help mitigate polygenic risk for developing traumatic 
      loss-related PTSD in US veterans. Podosomes, which are implicated in inflammatory 
      and neuroplasticity processes, may contribute to the genetic liability to 
      developing loss-related PTSD. Psychological treatments targeting attachment 
      security may help mitigate increased polygenic risk for loss-related PTSD in this 
      population.

AB  - Exposure to environmental enrichment can beneficially influence the behavior and 
      enhance synaptic plasticity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
      mediated effects of environmental enrichment on postnatal stress-associated 
      impact with regard to behavior, stress reactivity as well as synaptic plasticity 
      changes in the dorsal hippocampus. Wistar rat pups were submitted to a 3 h 
      maternal separation (MS) protocol during postnatal days 1-21, while another group 
      was left undisturbed. On postnatal day 23, a subgroup from each rearing condition 
      (maternal separation, no-maternal separation) was housed in enriched 
      environmental conditions until postnatal day 65 (6 weeks duration). At 
      approximately three months of age, adult rats underwent behavioral testing to 
      evaluate anxiety (Elevated Plus Maze), locomotion (Open Field Test), spatial 
      learning and memory (Morris Water Maze) as well as non-spatial recognition memory 
      (Novel Object Recognition Test). After completion of behavioral testing, blood 
      samples were taken for evaluation of stress-induced plasma corticosterone using 
      an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while immunofluorescence was 
      applied to evaluate hippocampal BDNF and synaptophysin expression in dorsal 
      hippocampus. We found that environmental enrichment protected against the effects 
      of maternal separation as indicated by the lower anxiety levels and the reversal 
      of spatial memory deficits compared to animals housed in standard conditions. 
      These changes were associated with increased BDNF and synaptophysin expression in 
      the hippocampus. Regarding the neuroendocrine response to stress, while exposure 
      to an acute stressor potentiated corticosterone increases in maternally-separated 
      rats, environmental enrichment of these rats prevented this effect. The current 
      study aimed at investigating the compensatory role of enriched environment 
      against the negative outcomes of adverse experiences early in life concurrently 
      on emotional and cognitive behaviors, HPA function and neuroplasticity markers.

AB  - Feline environmental enrichment can prevent numerous disorders including anxiety, 
      stress, obesity, and feline idiopathic cystitis. Despite its easy implementation 
      and low cost, it has received little attention. The main goal of this study was 
      to assess guardians' knowledge concerning feline environmental enrichment and 
      husbandry practices. A questionnaire was given to 130 companion animal guardians 
      at the Lisbon Veterinary Faculty's Teaching Hospital. The applications of 22 
      environmental enrichment measures related to food/water, litter box, and 
      space/entertainment areas were evaluated. The majority of the households studied 
      (74.6%) had a moderately enriched environment. Hygiene-related measures were 
      those most adopted by guardians, while those requiring guardians' commitment or 
      previous awareness were the least implemented. A rating scale was proposed and 
      applied to assess feline domestic environmental quality.

AB  - The post-weaning social environment has profound effects on behavior and 
      physiology in rodents. Social isolation increases anxiety-like behaviors and 
      novelty-induced locomotor activity, while environmental enrichment decreases 
      these behaviors. In some cases, the effects of social isolation are ameliorated 
      by repeated handling. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the 
      effects of handling differ in rats reared in social isolation and those reared in 
      an enriched environment. After weaning, male Long-Evans rats were housed 
      individually (ISO)(3) or in groups in an enriched environment (EE). During 
      adulthood, rats from each housing condition received four, once-daily, brief 
      handling sessions or remained undisturbed in the home cage. All rats were then 
      tested in the open field, elevated plus maze, and for behavioral responses to 
      d-amphetamine (1.0mg/kg). EE rats spent more time on the open arms of the 
      elevated plus maze and were more likely than ISO rats to emerge from the start 
      box in the open field, suggesting lower anxiety. Handling significantly decreased 
      open arm time in EE rats and marginally increased open arm time in ISO rats. 
      Housing condition did not affect amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity, but 
      handling altered the time course of the amphetamine response. ISO rats exhibited 
      significantly fewer stereotyped behaviors than did EE rats, but repeated handling 
      eliminated this difference. These findings support previously published studies 
      that suggest brief handling of adult rats may at least partially ameliorate the 
      effects of post-weaning social isolation on anxiety-like behaviors and 
      psychostimulant sensitivity. Furthermore, there are complex interactions between 
      the effects of housing environment and handling, suggesting that handling may be 
      perceived and/or processed differently, depending on the animal's housing 
      environment.

AB  - Environmental conditions are known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of 
      affective disorders. In this study, the effects of sertraline, a selective 
      serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 
      were investigated in rats reared in different housing conditions. Wistar rats of 
      both sexes were divided into three groups according to their rearing conditions 
      (Enriched = EC, Isolated = IC and Standard = SC), after weaning at postnatal day 
      21. While animals in control conditions were housed as a group of 4 rats in 
      regular size plexiglass cages, social isolation groups were housed individually 
      in metal cages. Animals in enriched conditions were housed as a group of 12 rats 
      in specially designed cages equipped with different stimulating objects. Six 
      weeks later, activitymeter, elevated plus maze, rotarod, grip, forced swimming 
      and sucrose preference tests were applied to all animals and all of the tests 
      were repeated after i.p. injection of sertraline (10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. 
      Environmental enrichment reduced the stereotypic behavior, improved the motor 
      coordination and facilitated the learning skills in animals. However, housing 
      conditions affected depression-like parameters, but not anxiety-like parameters. 
      Sertraline treatment reduced the depression-like effect in EC and SC, but not in 
      IC. It decreased anxiety-like behavior in IC while increased in EC. Socially 
      isolated animals preferentially consumed more sucrose and water than the other 
      groups, and interestingly, these differences became more significant following 
      sertraline treatment. These results show that the responses of animals to 
      anti-depressive drugs could be differentially affected by the behavioral 
      consequences of the diverse housing conditions. Thus, to improve the treatment of 
      depression; behavioral consequences of diverse housing conditions should be taken 
      into consideration.

LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3878-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - Both social defeat stress and environmental enrichment stimulate adrenal 
      glucocorticoid secretion, but they have opposing effects on hippocampal 
      neurogenesis and mood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation and 
      decreased neurogenesis are consequences of social defeat. These outcomes are 
      correlated with depressive states, but a causal role in the etiology of 
      depression remains elusive. The antidepressant actions of environmental 
      enrichment are neurogenesis-dependent, but the contribution of 
      enrichment-elevated glucocorticoids is unexplored. Importantly, for both social 
      defeat and environmental enrichment, how glucocorticoids interact with 
      neurogenesis to alter mood is unknown. Here, we investigate causal roles of 
      glucocorticoids and neurogenesis in induction of depressive-like behavior and its 
      amelioration by environmental enrichment in mice. By blocking neurogenesis and 
      surgically clamping adrenal hormone secretions, we showed that neurogenesis, via 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis interactions, is directly involved in 
      precipitating the depressive phenotype after social defeat. Mice adrenalectomized 
      before social defeat showed enhanced behavioral resiliency and increased survival 
      of adult-born hippocampal neurons compared with sham-operated defeated mice. 
      However, mice lacking hippocampal neurogenesis did not show protective effects of 
      adrenalectomy. Moreover, glucocorticoids secreted during environmental enrichment 
      promoted neurogenesis and were required for restoration of normal behavior after 
      social defeat. The data demonstrate that glucocorticoid-dependent declines in 
      neurogenesis drive changes in mood after social defeat and that glucocorticoids 
      secreted during enrichment promote neurogenesis and restore normal behavior after 
      defeat. These data provide new evidence for direct involvement of neurogenesis in 
      the etiology of depression, suggesting that treatments promoting neurogenesis can 
      enhance stress resilience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular alterations underlying the pathogenesis of depression 
      have not been systematically defined. Increasing evidence suggests that 
      hippocampus metabolism is strongly involved in the pathogenesis of chronic mild 
      unpredictable stress (CUMS)-induced depression. The principal objective of this 
      study was to reveal important information concerning the pathogenesis of 
      depression through a comprehensive analysis of metabolites in the hippocampus in 
      a CUMS rat model. METHODS: Metabolites related to metabolic changes in the 
      hippocampus in the CUMS model were collected from a depression-specific database 
      and published literature. Potential metabolite pathways were identified by the 
      Omicsolution tool. Then, crosstalk analysis was carried out to investigate the 
      relationship between different important pathways. In addition, MetaboAnalyst was 
      used to analyze potential metabolites for drug-related metabolite enrichment 
      analysis, which was used to study hippocampus metabolite-related drug pathways in 
      a CUMS model. Then, a metabolite-protein interaction (MPI) network was 
      constructed and analyzed to identify important metabolites and proteins. The 
      functional modules were extracted using the CNM network decomposition algorithm. 
      Finally, neurotransmitters in the hippocampus of rats with CUMS depression were 
      detected to verify the important pathways. RESULTS: In the current study, 53 
      significantly enriched pathways related to the 107 identified metabolites were 
      selected, and the top ranked enriched pathways included arginine and proline 
      metabolism, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, phenylalanine metabolism, 
      bile secretion, and glutathione metabolism. Pathway crosstalk analysis showed 
      that the significantly enriched pathways were divided into two interrelated 
      modules, which were mainly involved in metabolism, signal transduction, 
      neurotransmitters, and the endocrine system. Enrichment analysis of drug-related 
      metabolic KEGG pathways identified the antibiotic pathways as the most important 
      pathways. In the MPI network, the hub metabolites were phosphate, arachidonic 
      acid, oxoglutaric acid, l-glutamic acid, and glutathione, and the hub proteins 
      were Got1, Got2, Tat, Ccbl1, Ccbl2, Il4i1. A total of 16 functional modules were 
      extracted from the MPI network by using the CNM algorithm. Finally, metabolites 
      related to serotonergic synapses, dopaminergic synapses, and glutamatergic 
      synapses were found to be involved in the pathology of depression. CONCLUSION: We 
      found that neurotransmitter pathways (serotonergic synapses, dopaminergic 
      synapses and glutamatergic synapses) in the hippocampus play a crucial role in 
      the underlying molecular mechanism of depression, which provides useful clues for 
      identifying the detailed depression-associated metabolic profiles.

TI  - Type 2 Deiodinase Disruption in Astrocytes Results in Anxiety-Depressive-Like 
      Behavior in Male Mice.
PG  - 3682-95

AB  - Millions of levothyroxine-treated hypothyroid patients complain of impaired 
      cognition despite normal TSH serum levels. This could reflect abnormalities in 
      the type 2 deiodinase (D2)-mediated T4-to-T3 conversion, given their much greater 
      dependence on the D2 pathway for T3 production. T3 normally reaches the brain 
      directly from the circulation or is produced locally by D2 in astrocytes. Here we 
      report that mice with astrocyte-specific Dio2 inactivation (Astro-D2KO) have 
      normal serum T3 but exhibit anxiety-depression-like behavior as found in open 
      field and elevated plus maze studies and when tested for depression using the 
      tail-suspension and the forced-swimming tests. Remarkably, 4 weeks of daily 
      treadmill exercise sessions eliminated this phenotype. Microarray gene expression 
      profiling of the Astro-D2KO hippocampi identified an enrichment of three gene 
      sets related to inflammation and impoverishment of three gene sets related to 
      mitochondrial function and response to oxidative stress. Despite normal 
      neurogenesis, the Astro-D2KO hippocampi exhibited decreased expression of four of 
      six known to be positively regulated genes by T3, ie, Mbp (∼43%), Mag (∼34%), Hr 
      (∼49%), and Aldh1a1 (∼61%) and increased expression of 3 of 12 genes negatively 
      regulated by T3, ie, Dgkg (∼17%), Syce2 (∼26%), and Col6a1 (∼3-fold) by 
      quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, in Astro-D2KO animals, there was also a 
      reduction in mRNA levels of genes known to be affected in classical animal models 
      of depression, ie, Bdnf (∼18%), Ntf3 (∼43%), Nmdar (∼26%), and GR (∼20%), which 
      were also normalized by daily exercise sessions. These findings suggest that 
      defects in Dio2 expression in the brain could result in mood and behavioral 
      disorders.

AB  - Dendrobium nobile Lindl. alkaloid (DNLA) is effective against animal models of 
      Alzheimer's disease. This study further examined its effect on anxiety and 
      depression produced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Rats were subjected to 
      CUS for 42 days, followed by DNLA treatment (20 mg/kg/day, po) for 28 days. The 
      behavioral tests, histopathology, neurotransmitters and RNA-Seq were examined. 
      DNLA attenuated body weight loss and CUS-induced anxiety/depressive-like 
      behaviors, as evidenced by the elevated-plus-maze test, open-field test and 
      sucrose preference. DNLA alleviated neuronal damage and loss and increased Nissl 
      bodies in the hippocampus CA2 region and cortex. DNLA decreased CUS-elevated 
      5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine and monoamine oxidase and 
      catechol-O-methyltransferase activities in the brain. DNLA attenuated HPA 
      activation by decreasing adrenocorticotropic hormones and the expression of 
      corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1, and increased the expression of 
      glucocorticoid receptor in the brain. RNA-Seq revealed distinct gene expression 
      patterns among groups. Gene ontology revealed the cell projection assembly, 
      postsynapse and centrosome as top biological processes, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment showed the cAMP, cGMP-PKG, glutamatergic 
      synapse and circadian as major pathways for DNLA effects. Using DESeq2, CUS 
      modulated 1700 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were prevented or 
      attenuated by DNLA. CUS-induced DEGs were highly correlated with the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for anxiety and depression and were ameliorated 
      by DNLA. Taken together, DNLA attenuated anxiety/depression-like behavior and 
      neuronal damage induced by CUS in rats. The mechanisms could be related to 
      regulation of the monoamine neurotransmitters and the HPA axis, and modulation of 
      gene expression in the hippocampus.

AB  - Etiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains largely unknown. Studies 
      have shown that a significant subset of patients with PTSD exhibit increased 
      inflammation, suggesting that the understanding of this disorder could be 
      facilitated by classifying these patients by inflammatory status. Here we 
      performed a microarray-based blood transcriptome analysis on proinflammatory 
      status-stratified Japanese civilian women with PTSD most of whom developed the 
      disorder after experiencing interpersonal violence. By utilizing our previously 
      identified cut-off serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level that approximately 
      corresponded to the median IL-6 level of our PTSD patients, we classified 
      patients into those with high IL-6 levels and those with normal IL-6 levels 
      (n = 16 for each). Transcriptome profiles of these 2 groups were compared with 
      the profile of 16 age-matched healthy control women. Differentially expressed 
      genes between high IL-6 patients and controls showed significant enrichment in a 
      number of gene ontology terms and pathways primarily involved in 
      immune/inflammatory responses, and their protein-protein interaction network was 
      significantly enriched. In contrast, differentially expressed genes between 
      normal IL-6 patients and controls showed significant enrichment in several gene 
      ontology terms related to ion transport and neural function. The microarray data 
      were confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. These findings 
      illustrate the heterogeneous molecular mechanisms of PTSD within this relatively 
      homogeneous sample in terms of sex, trauma type, and ethnicity, suggesting that 
      peripheral proinflammatory status such as IL-6 levels could be a useful subtyping 
      marker for this disorder. With further research, it is hoped that our findings 
      will be translated into personalized medicine.

AB  - Spatial orientation is an important skill as it improves, for example, foraging, 
      localisation of recourses, predator avoidance or navigation. Habitat complexity 
      positively affects spatial abilities in various fish species with a more complex 
      environment promoting learning ability. However, to what extent a complex social 
      environment affects cognitive abilities in fishes has received less attention. 
      Here, we investigated differences in maze performance of adult females of the 
      West African cichlid fish Pelvicachromis taeniatus, which had been reared and 
      maintained either in a group or in isolation from an early age on. Fish had to 
      master the route through a maze in order to gain a food reward. Our results 
      indicate marked differences in performance contingent upon social 
      rearing-environment: isolation fish ran successful trials (i.e. locating the food 
      reward) significantly more often than group fish and were faster during trials, 
      also in a reversed maze. However, the number of mistakes did not differ between 
      isolation and group fish and the time needed to relocate the food reward did not 
      diminish with elapsed training days. In a second experiment, the activity of 
      group and isolation fish was analysed in an open field test. Here, isolation fish 
      were less active than group fish. We discuss different possibilities for 
      performance differences of group and isolation fish including enhanced cognitive 
      abilities of isolation fish, motivational/emotional differences and 
      hyperactivity.

AB  - Touch can positively influence cognition and emotion, but the underlying 
      mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that tactile experience enrichment 
      improves memory and alleviates anxiety by remodeling neurons along the 
      dorsoventral axis of the dentate gyrus (DG) in adult mice. Tactile enrichment 
      induces differential activation and structural modification of neurons in the 
      dorsal and ventral DG, and increases the presynaptic input from the lateral 
      entorhinal cortex (LEC), which is reciprocally connected with the primary 
      somatosensory cortex (S1), to tactile experience-activated DG neurons. 
      Chemogenetic activation of tactile experience-tagged dorsal and ventral DG 
      neurons enhances memory and reduces anxiety respectively, whereas inactivation of 
      these neurons or S1-innervated LEC neurons abolishes the beneficial effects of 
      tactile enrichment. Moreover, adulthood tactile enrichment attenuates early-life 
      stress-induced memory deficits and anxiety-related behavior. Our findings 
      demonstrate that enriched tactile experience retunes the pathway from S1 to DG 
      and enhances DG neuronal plasticity to modulate cognition and emotion.

AB  - RATIONALE: Early-life environment influences reinforcer and drug motivation in 
      adulthood; however, the impact on specific components of motivation, including 
      hedonic value ("liking"), remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: The current study 
      determined whether differential rearing alters liking and aversive responding to 
      ethanol, sucrose, and quinine in an ethanol-naïve rat model. METHODS: Male and 
      female rats were reared for 30 days starting at postnatal day 21 in either an 
      enriched (EC), isolated (IC), or standard condition (SC). Thereafter, all rats 
      had indwelling intraoral fistulae implanted and their taste reactivity to water, 
      ethanol (5, 10, 20, 30, 40% v/v), sucrose (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 M), and quinine (0.1, 
      0.5 mM) was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: EC rats had higher amounts of liking 
      responses to ethanol, sucrose, and quinine and higher amounts of aversive 
      responses to ethanol and quinine compared to IC rats. While EC and IC rats' 
      responses were different from each other, they both tended to be similar to SCs, 
      who fell in between the EC and IC groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 
      environmental enrichment may enhance sensitivity to a variety of tastants, 
      thereby enhancing liking, while isolation may dull sensitivity, thereby dulling 
      liking. Altogether, the evidence suggests that isolated rats have a shift in the 
      allostatic set-point which may, in part, drive increased responding for a variety 
      of rewards including ethanol and sucrose. Enriched rats have enhanced liking of 
      both sucrose and ethanol suggesting that enrichment may offer a unique phenotype 
      with divergent preferences for incentive motivation.

AB  - Debilitating mental illness like depression and related mood disorders is due to 
      the disruption in circuitry that controls emotion, motivation, and reward, 
      characterized by disparate phenotypes like decrease in socialization, motivation, 
      threshold for threat apprehension, etc. Chronic stress is a major factor in the 
      etiology of these disorders. Here, using a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) 
      paradigm the characterization of an array of mood disorder phenotypes in adult 
      zebrafish, in comparison to normal control unstressed fish, was achieved using a 
      battery of behavioral assays including novel ones comprising social interaction 
      test, feed approach test, threat response test and novel tank test. For the 
      predictive validity of the model for mood disorders, the mitigative role of a 
      slow (imipramine) and fast (ketamine) acting antidepressant was assessed. The 
      molecular changes associated with CUS-induced mood disorder phenotype was 
      investigated utilizing a high throughput method called isobaric tag for relative 
      and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) in telencephalon, the region critically 
      associated with the processing of emotional information in the fish brain. Out of 
      222 proteins identified to be significantly altered, 58 were differentially 
      expressed across the stress and antidepressant-treatment groups at more than one 
      fold (in log2) change. Of these proteins, some were implicated in earlier studies 
      on mood disorders such as CABP1, PER2, mTOR, etc. The enrichment of altered 
      proteins by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) led us to mTOR and opioid signaling 
      pathways, the top canonical pathways affected in the fish telencephalon. 
      Interestingly, most of the pathways affected converge at the one controlling cell 
      proliferation thus indicating altered neurogenesis, which was validated using 
      immunohistochemistry for cell proliferation markers BrdU, SOX2, and BLBP. The 
      study concludes that molecules that regulate telencephalon neural progenitor cell 
      proliferation or neurogenesis are crucially involved in chronic stress-induced 
      mood disorders by affecting the circuitry that controls emotion and reward.

AB  - Anhedonia, or the inability to experience positive feelings is a hallmark of 
      depression. However, few animal models have relied on decreased positive affect 
      as an index of susceptibility to depression. Rats emit frequency-modulated 
      ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), designated as "positive" calls in the 50-kHz 
      range. USVs have been associated with pharmacological activation of motivational 
      reward circuits. Here we utilized selectively-bred rats differing in 
      "emotionality" to ask whether there are associated differences in USVs. Rats bred 
      based on locomotor response to novelty and classified as bred High Responders 
      (bHRs) or bred Low Responders (bLRs) exhibit inborn differences in response to 
      environmental cues, stress responsiveness, and depression-like behavior. These 
      animals also exhibit differences in anxiety-like behavior, which are reversed by 
      exposure to environmental complexity (EC). Finally, these animals exhibit unique 
      profiles of responsiveness to rewarding stimuli accompanied with distinct 
      patterns of dopamine regulation. We investigated whether acute and chronic 
      environmental manipulations impacted USVs in bHRs and bLRs. We found that, 
      relative to bLRs, bHRs emitted significantly more 50-kHz USVs. However, if a bLR 
      is accompanied by another bLR, there is a significant increase in 50-kHZ USVs 
      emitted by this phenotype. bHRs emitted increases in 50-kHZ UVSs upon first 
      exposure to EC, whereas bLRs showed a similar increase only after repeated 
      exposure. bLRs' increase in positive affect after chronic EC was coupled with 
      significant positive correlations between corticosterone levels and c-fos mRNA in 
      the accumbens. Conversely, a decline in the rate of positive calls in bHRs after 
      chronic EC was associated with a negative correlation between corticosterone and 
      accumbens c-fos mRNA. These studies demonstrate that inborn differences in 
      emotionality interact with the environment to influence positive affect and 
      underscore the potential interaction between glucocorticoids and the mesolimbic 
      reward circuitry in modulating 50-kHz calls.

TI  - Short-term exposure to enriched environment rescues chronic stress-induced 
      impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity, anxiety, and memory deficits.

AB  - Exposure to prolonged stress results in structural and functional alterations in 
      the hippocampus including reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), neurogenesis, 
      spatial learning and working memory impairments, and enhanced anxiety-like 
      behavior. On the other hand, enriched environment (EE) has beneficial effects on 
      hippocampal structure and function, such as improved memory, increased 
      hippocampal neurogenesis, and progressive synaptic plasticity. It is unclear 
      whether exposure to short-term EE for 10 days can overcome restraint 
      stress-induced cognitive deficits and impaired hippocampal plasticity. 
      Consequently, the present study explored the beneficial effects of short-term EE 
      on chronic stress-induced impaired LTP, working memory, and anxiety-like 
      behavior. Male Wistar rats were subjected to chronic restraint stress (6 hr/day) 
      over a period of 21 days, and then they were exposed to EE (6 hr/day) for 10 
      days. Restraint stress reduced hippocampal CA1-LTP, increased anxiety-like 
      symptoms in elevated plus maze, and impaired working memory in T-maze task. 
      Remarkably, EE facilitated hippocampal LTP, improved working memory performance, 
      and completely overcame the effect of chronic stress on anxiety behavior. In 
      conclusion, exposure to EE can bring out positive effects on synaptic plasticity 
      in the hippocampus and thereby elicit its beneficial effects on cognitive 
      functions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Integrated genetic, epigenetic, and gene set enrichment analyses identify NOTCH 
      as a potential mediator for PTSD risk after trauma: Results from two independent 
      African cohorts.

AB  - The risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases with the 
      number of traumatic event types experienced (trauma load) in interaction with 
      other psychobiological risk factors. The NOTCH (neurogenic locus notch homolog 
      proteins) signaling pathway, consisting of four different trans-membrane receptor 
      proteins (NOTCH1-4), constitutes an evolutionarily well-conserved intercellular 
      communication pathway (involved, e.g., in cell-cell interaction, inflammatory 
      signaling, and learning processes). Its association with fear memory 
      consolidation makes it an interesting candidate for PTSD research. We tested for 
      significant associations of common genetic variants of NOTCH1-4 (investigated by 
      microarray) and genomic methylation of saliva-derived DNA with lifetime PTSD risk 
      in independent cohorts from Northern Uganda (N(1) = 924) and Rwanda (N(2) = 371), 
      and investigated whether NOTCH-related gene sets were enriched for associations 
      with lifetime PTSD risk. We found associations of lifetime PTSD risk with single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2074621 (NOTCH3) (p(uncorrected) = 0.04) in both 
      cohorts, and with methylation of CpG site cg17519949 (NOTCH3) (p(uncorrected) = 
      0.05) in Rwandans. Yet, none of the (epi-)genetic associations survived multiple 
      testing correction. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed enrichment for 
      associations of two NOTCH pathways with lifetime PTSD risk in Ugandans: NOTCH 
      binding (p(corrected) = 0.003) and NOTCH receptor processing (p(corrected) = 
      0.01). The environmental factor trauma load was significant in all analyses (all 
      p < 0.001). Our integrated methodological approach suggests NOTCH as a possible 
      mediator of PTSD risk after trauma. The results require replication, and the 
      precise underlying pathophysiological mechanisms should be illuminated in future 
      studies.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious mental illness 
      characterized by mood changes and high suicide rates. However, no studies are 
      available to support a blood test method for MDD diagnosis. The objective of this 
      research was to identify potential peripheral blood biomarkers for MDD and 
      characterize the novel pathophysiology. Methods: We accessed whole blood 
      microarray sequencing data for MDD and control samples from public databases. 
      Biological functions were analysed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses 
      using the clusterprofile R package. Infiltrated immune cell (IIC) proportions 
      were identified using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Clustering was performed using the 
      ConsensusClusterPlus R package. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) were assessed 
      by constructing a PPI network using STRING and visualized using Cytoscape 
      software. Rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 
      6 weeks to induce stress behaviour. Stress behaviour was evaluated by open field 
      experiments and forced swimming tests. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the 
      proportion of CD8(+) T cells. The expression of the corresponding key genes was 
      detected by qRT-PCR. Results: We divided MDD patients into CD8H and CD8L 
      clusters. The functional enrichment of marker genes in the CD8H cluster indicated 
      that autophagy-related terms and pathways were significantly enriched. 
      Furthermore, we obtained 110 autophagy-related marker genes (ARMGs) in the CD8H 
      cluster through intersection analysis. GO and KEGG analyses further showed that 
      these ARMGs may regulate a variety of autophagy processes and be involved in the 
      onset and advancement of MDD. Finally, 10 key ARMGs were identified through PPI 
      analysis: RAB1A, GNAI3, VAMP7, RAB33B, MYC, LAMP2, RAB11A, HIF1A, KIF5B, and 
      PTEN. In the CUMS model, flow cytometric analysis confirmed the above findings. 
      qRT-PCR revealed significant decreases in the mRNA levels of Gnai3, Rab33b, 
      Lamp2, and Kif5b in the CUMS groups. Conclusion: In this study, MDD was divided 
      into two subtypes. We combined immune infiltrating CD8(+) T cells with 
      autophagy-related genes and screened a total of 10 ARMG genes. In particular, 
      RAB1A, GNAI3, RAB33B, LAMP2, and KIF5B were first reported in MDD. These genes 
      may offer new hope for the clinical diagnosis of MDD.

AB  - Several behavioral interventions, based on social enrichment and observational 
      learning are applied in treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the 
      mechanism of such modulatory effect and the safety of applied methods on 
      individuals involved in social support need further investigation. We took 
      advantage of known differences between inbred mouse strains to reveal the effect 
      of social enrichment on behavior and neurobiology of animals with different 
      behavioral phenotypes. C57BL/6 and DBA/2 female mice displaying multiple 
      differences in cognitive, social, and emotional behavior were group-housed either 
      in same-strain or in mixed-strain conditions. Comprehensive behavioral 
      phenotyping and analysis of expression of several plasticity- and stress-related 
      genes were done to measure the reciprocal effects of social interaction between 
      the strains. Contrary to our expectation, mixed housing did not change the 
      behavior of DBA/2 mice. Nevertheless, the level of serum corticosterone and the 
      expression of glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 in the brain were increased in mixed 
      housed DBA/2 as compared with those of separately housed DBA/2 mice. In contrast, 
      socially active C57BL/6 animals were more sensitive to the mixed housing, 
      displaying several signs of stress: alterations in learning, social, and 
      anxiety-like behavior and anhedonia. These behavioral impairments were 
      accompanied by the elevated serum corticosterone and the reduced expression of 
      Nr3c1, as well as the elevated Bdnf levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Our 
      results demonstrate the importance of social factors in modulation of both 
      behavior and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms in stress response, and 
      draw attention to the potential negative impact of social interventions for 
      individuals involved in social support.

TI  - Behavioral and Transcriptomic Fingerprints of an Enriched Environment in Horses

AB  - The use of environmental enrichment (EE) has grown in popularity over decades, 
      particularly because EE is known to promote cognitive functions and well-being. 
      Nonetheless, little is known about how EE may affect personality and gene 
      expression. To address this question in a domestic animal, 10-month-old horses 
      were maintained in a controlled environment or EE for 12 weeks. The control 
      horses (n = 9) lived in individual stalls on wood shaving bedding. They were 
      turned out to individual paddocks three times a week and were fed three times a 
      day with pellets or hay. EE-treated horses (n = 10) were housed in large 
      individual stalls on straw bedding 7 hours per day and spent the remainder of the 
      time together at pasture. They were fed three times a day with flavored pellets, 
      hay, or fruits and were exposed daily to various objects, odors, and music. The 
      EE modified three dimensions of personality: fearfulness, reactivity to humans, 
      and sensory sensitivity. Some of these changes persisted >3 months after 
      treatment. These changes are suggestive of a more positive perception of the 
      environment and a higher level of curiosity in EE-treated horses, explaining 
      partly why these horses showed better learning performance in a Go/No-Go task. 
      Reduced expression of stress indicators indicated that the EE also improved 
      well-being. Finally, whole-blood transcriptomic analysis showed that in addition 
      to an effect on the cortisol level, the EE induced the expression of genes 
      involved in cell growth and proliferation, while the control treatment activated 
      genes related to apoptosis. Changes in both behavior and gene expression may 
      constitute a psychobiological signature of the effects of enrichment and result 
      in improved well-being. This study illustrates how the environment interacts with 
      genetic information in shaping the individual at both the behavioral and 
      molecular levels.

TI  - Early life and adult stress promote sex dependent changes in hypothalamic miRNAs 
      and environmental enrichment prevents stress-induced miRNA and gene expression 
      changes in rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hypothalamus plays a key role in the stress response. While early 
      life stress (ELS) increases susceptibility to psychiatric disorders including 
      major depressive disorder (MDD), acute stress during adulthood can also 
      precipitate MDD after ELS. AIM: Here, we tested the expression of miRNAs 
      following ELS and susceptibility to depression-like behavior and whether sex or 
      acute stress exacerbates this response. We also tested whether environmental 
      enrichment (Enr) promotes early life and adult behavioral stress resilience and 
      its effect on hypothalamic miRNA and gene expression. Following rat maternal 
      separation (MS) as an ELS model, Enr from weaning through adulthood, and 
      restraint (RS) as acute adult stress, we tested both animal behavior and miRNA 
      expression in the hypothalamus. Target genes and their enrichment and ontology 
      were analyzed using bioinformatic tools. Target gene expression changes were 
      tested using qPCR, and miRNA promoter methylation was studied using 
      methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation qPCR. RESULTS: MS, Enr, RS, and sex altered 
      hypothalamic miRNAs, including several previously reported in MS literature: 
      miRs-29, - 124, - 132, - 144, - 504. Sex had a significant effect on the greatest 
      number of miRNAs. Also, Enr reversed downregulation of miR-29b-1-5p and -301b-3p 
      in MS. qPCR showed that MAPK6 and MMP19, targets of miR-301b-3p, were upregulated 
      in MS and reversed by Enr. Additionally, miR-219a was hypermethylated in MS 
      coinciding with decreased miR-219a expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that 
      sex plays a critical role in the hypothalamic miRNA response to both ELS and 
      acute stress, with males expressing greater changes following postnatal stress. 
      Moreover, enrichment significantly altered behavior as well as hypothalamic miRNA 
      expression and their gene targets. Because of its role as the initiator of the 
      autonomic stress response and connection to hedonic and motivational behavior, 
      the hypothalamic miRNA landscape may significantly alter both the short and 
      long-term behavioral response to stress.

AB  - Severe and prolonged stress is the main environmental factor that precipitates 
      depression, anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions. On the other hand, exposure to 
      environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to induce progressive plasticity in 
      the brain and improve learning and memory in various neurological and psychiatric 
      disorders. It is not known whether exposure to enriched environment could 
      ameliorate chronic immobilisation stress-induced cognitive deficits and altered 
      molecular markers. Hence, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the effect of 
      enriched environment on chronic immobilisation stress (CIS) associated changes in 
      spatial learning and memory, behavioural measures of anxiety, depression and 
      molecular markers as well as structural alterations. Male Wistar rats were 
      subjected to chronic immobilisation stress for 2h/day/10days followed by 2weeks 
      of exposure to EE. CIS resulted in weight loss, anhedonia, increased immobility, 
      spatial learning and memory impairment, enhanced anxiety, and reduced expression 
      of BDNF, VEGF, GFAP and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in discrete brain regions. 
      Interestingly, stressed rats exposed to enrichment ameliorated behavioural 
      depression, spatial learning and memory impairment and reduced anxiety behaviour. 
      In addition, EE restored BDNF, VEGF, GFAP and GR expression and normalized 
      hypotrophy of dentate gyrus and hippocampus in CIS rats. In contrast, EE did not 
      restore hypertrophy of the amygdalar complex. Thus, EE ameliorates stress-induced 
      cognitive deficits by modulating the neurotrophic factors, astrocytes and 
      glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and amygdala.

TI  - Environmental enrichment enhances autophagy signaling in the rat hippocampus.
PG  - 113-23
AB  - The findings that antidepressive treatments increase hippocampal neurotrophins 
      have led researchers to emphasize the importance of neurogenesis, formation of 
      new dendrites, and survival of neurons in the brain. However, it is difficult to 
      maintain neural plasticity just by enriching the environment to facilitate 
      formation of new networks. Neural plasticity also requires a degradation process 
      that clears off unnecessary and undesirable components. We have recently reported 
      an increase in autophagy signaling (wherein the cell digests components of 
      itself) that has the potential of enhancing neuronal and synaptic plasticity 
      after multiple sessions of electroconvulsive seizure treatment. The present study 
      revealed an increase in autophagy signaling in the rat hippocampus following 2 
      weeks of environmental enrichment (EE), a procedure known to elicit 
      antidepressive and anxiolytic behavioral changes in various animal paradigms. 
      Western blot analysis showed an increase in hippocampal expression of 
      microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), which is lipidated from 
      LC3-I, in rats in the EE group. The effectiveness of the 2-week EE housing 
      condition was validated by anxiolytic effects observed in the elevated plus maze 
      test, enhanced habituation in the open field test, and elevation of hippocampal 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. In addition, we showed that the EE 
      housing condition ameliorated numbing/avoidance behaviors, but not hypervigilant 
      behaviors, in an animal model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is 
      the first report to show that EE can increase autophagy signaling and improve 
      numbing/avoidance behaviors in an animal model of PTSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ample evidence indicates that chronic adolescence stress 
      is associated with an increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders in 
      adulthood. Given the importance of the effective therapeutic ways to overcome 
      adolescent stress-related deficits, the present study investigated the effects of 
      Spirulina platensis (SP), environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary exercise 
      (EX) and their combination on anxiety or depression-like behaviors, oxidative 
      stress, and alterations of BDNF and 5HT-3 receptors in the prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) induced by adolescent stress in adult female rats. METHODS: During the 
      adolescent period (PNDs30-40), rats were subjected to restraint stress. Then, the 
      animals were subjected to SP treatment (200 mg/kg/day), EX, EE, and the combined 
      treatments (SP+EX, and SP+EE) for 15 days between PNDs41-55. Subsequently, 
      anxiety or depression-like behaviors, BDNF levels, oxidative stress markers and 
      mRNA expression of BDNF and 5HT(3) in the PFC were assessed. RESULTS: Stressed 
      rats demonstrated enhanced anxiety levels and depression-like behaviors in 
      adulthood. Regarding the oxidative stress markers, stressed rats exhibited 
      significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, 
      higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and superoxide 
      dismutase) and significantly lower total antioxidant reactivity capacity in the 
      PFC. Additionally, adolescent stress significantly increased 5HT3 receptor mRNA 
      expression and decreased BDNF content and its mRNA expression in the PFC. 
      Treatments with SP, EX, EE, and the combined interventions alleviated these 
      deficits. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that appropriate interventions during 
      the adolescent period can protect against adolescent stress-induced behavioral, 
      and biochemical defects and oxidative stress damage in adulthood.

AB  - Although studies provide insights into the neurobiology of stress and depression, 
      the exact molecular mechanisms underlying their pathologies remain largely 
      unknown. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in brain functions and 
      behavior. A potential link between lncRNA and psychiatric disorders has been 
      proposed. However, it remains undetermined whether IncRNA regulation, in the 
      brain, contributes to stress or depression pathologies. In this study, we used a 
      valid animal model of depression-like symptoms; namely learned helplessness, 
      RNA-seq, Gene Ontology and co-expression network analyses to profile the 
      expression pattern of lncRNA and mRNA in the hippocampus of mice. We identified 
      6346 differentially expressed transcripts. Among them, 340 lncRNAs and 3559 
      protein coding mRNAs were differentially expressed in helpless mice in comparison 
      with control and/or non-helpless mice (inescapable stress resilient mice). Gene 
      Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses indicated that induction of helplessness 
      altered expression of mRNAs enriched in fundamental biological functions 
      implicated in stress/depression neurobiology such as synaptic, metabolic, cell 
      survival and proliferation, developmental and chromatin modification functions. 
      To explore the possible regulatory roles of the altered lncRNAs, we constructed 
      co-expression networks composed of the lncRNAs and mRNAs. Among our 
      differentially expressed lncRNAs, 17% showed significant correlation with genes. 
      Functional co-expression analysis linked the identified lncRNAs to several 
      cellular mechanisms implicated in stress/depression neurobiology. Importantly, 
      57% of the identified regulatory lncRNAs significantly correlated with 18 
      different synapse-related functions. Thus, the current study identifies for the 
      first time distinct groups of lncRNAs regulated by induction of learned 
      helplessness in the mouse brain. Our results suggest that lncRNA-directed 
      regulatory mechanisms might contribute to stress-induced pathologies; in 
      particular, to inescapable stress-induced synaptic modifications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disorder that is 
      traditionally stratified based on clinical signs and symptoms. Recent imaging and 
      molecular biomarker innovations provide unprecedented opportunities for improved 
      TBI precision medicine, incorporating patho-anatomical and molecular mechanisms. 
      Complete integration of these diverse data for TBI diagnosis and patient 
      stratification remains an unmet challenge. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Transforming 
      Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot 
      multicenter study enrolled 586 acute TBI patients and collected diverse common 
      data elements (TBI-CDEs) across the study population, including imaging, 
      genetics, and clinical outcomes. We then applied topology-based data-driven 
      discovery to identify natural subgroups of patients, based on the TBI-CDEs 
      collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 1) A machine learning tool known as 
      topological data analysis (TDA) would reveal data-driven patterns in patient 
      outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of recovery, and 2) TDA-identified 
      biomarkers would significantly predict patient outcome recovery after TBI using 
      more traditional methods of univariate statistical tests. TDA algorithms 
      organized and mapped the data of TBI patients in multidimensional space, 
      identifying a subset of mild TBI patients with a specific multivariate phenotype 
      associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 months after injury. Further 
      analyses revealed that this patient subset had high rates of post-traumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD), and enrichment in several distinct genetic polymorphisms 
      associated with cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (PARP1), and in 
      striatal dopamine processing (ANKK1, COMT, DRD2). CONCLUSIONS: TDA identified a 
      unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome after mild TBI 
      that were significantly predicted by the presence of specific genetic 
      polymorphisms. Machine learning methods such as TDA may provide a robust method 
      for patient stratification and treatment planning targeting identified biomarkers 
      in future clinical trials in TBI patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Unilateral brain injury to pregnant rats induces asymmetric neurological deficits 
      in the offspring.
PG  - 3621-3633
LID - 10.1111/ejn.15243 [doi]
AB  - Effects of environmental factors may be transmitted to the following generation, 
      and cause neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and 
      posttraumatic stress disorder in the offspring. Enhanced synaptic plasticity 
      induced by environmental enrichment may be also transmitted. We here test the 
      hypothesis that the effects of brain injury in pregnant animals may produce 
      neurological deficits in the offspring. Unilateral brain injury (UBI) by ablation 
      of the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex in pregnant rats resulted in the development 
      of hindlimb postural asymmetry (HL-PA), and impairment of balance and 
      coordination in beam walking test in the offspring. The offspring of rats with 
      the left UBI exhibited HL-PA before and after spinal cord transection with the 
      contralesional (i.e., right) hindlimb flexion. The right UBI caused the offspring 
      to develop HL-PA that however was cryptic and not-lateralized; it was evident 
      only after spinalization, and was characterized by similar occurrence of the 
      ipsi- and contralesional hindlimb flexion. The HL-PA persisted after 
      spinalization suggesting that the asymmetry was encoded in lumbar spinal 
      neurocircuits that control hindlimb muscles. Balance and coordination were 
      affected by the right UBI but not the left UBI. Thus, the effects of a unilateral 
      brain lesion in pregnant animals may be intergenerationally transmitted, and this 
      process may depend on the side of brain injury. The results suggest the existence 
      of left-right side-specific mechanisms that mediate transmission of the 
      lateralized effects of brain trauma from mother to fetus.

AB  - Dietary supplementation with the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid 
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to have a beneficial effect on reducing 
      the symptoms associated with several neuropsychiatric conditions including 
      anxiety and depression. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain 
      largely unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that the vast repertoire of 
      commensal bacteria within the gut plays a critical role in regulating various 
      biological processes in the brain and may contribute to neuropsychiatric disease 
      risk. The present study determined the contribution of DHA on anxiety and 
      depressive-like behaviors through modulation of the gut microbiota in a paradigm 
      of social isolation. Adult male and female mice were subjected to social 
      isolation for 28days and then placed either on a control diet or a diet 
      supplemented with 0.1% or 1.0% DHA. Fecal pellets were collected both 24h and 
      7days following the introduction of the new diets. Behavioral testing revealed 
      that male mice fed a DHA diet, regardless of dose, exhibited reduced anxiety and 
      depressive-like behaviors compared to control fed mice while no differences were 
      observed in female mice. As the microbiota-brain-axis has been recently 
      implicated in behavior, composition of microbial communities were analyzed to 
      examine if these sex-specific effects of DHA may be associated with changes in 
      the gut microbiota (GM). Clear sex differences were observed with males and 
      females showing distinct microbial compositions prior to DHA supplementation. The 
      introduction of DHA into the diet also induced sex-specific interactions on the 
      GM with the fatty acid producing a significant effect on the microbial profiles 
      in males but not in females. Interestingly, levels of Allobaculum and 
      Ruminococcus were found to significantly correlate with the behavioral changes 
      observed in the male mice. Predictive metagenome analysis using PICRUSt was 
      performed on the fecal samples collected from males and identified enrichment in 
      functional KEGG pathway terms relevant to processes such as the biosynthesis of 
      unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant metabolism. These results indicate that 
      DHA alters commensal community composition and produces beneficial effects on 
      anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in a sex-specific manner. The present study 
      provides insight into the mechanistic role that gut microbes may play in the 
      regulation of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and how dietary intervention 
      can modulate these effects.

AB  - Previous research documented positive associations between cognitively 
      stimulating work and levels of cognitive performance, while longitudinal 
      associations are less clear. We used 20-year longitudinal data from the 
      Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development and Aging (ILSE) to 
      examine the role of perceived work environment (autonomy, innovation, social 
      integration, and stress) and work activities derived from an occupational 
      database (related to information, to people, and manual activities) for 
      trajectories of cognitive abilities (processing speed, fluid and crystallized 
      intelligence). We used data from 374 participants in the ILSE midlife cohort 
      (born 1950-52) who were working at baseline and had valid observations on work 
      characteristics and control variables including education, gender, region (former 
      East vs. West Germany), and personal income (mean age at baseline = 44 years, SD 
      = 1, 44% women). Cognitively stimulating perceived work environments (higher 
      levels of autonomy and innovation), higher levels of work activities related to 
      information and people, and lower levels of manual activity at baseline were 
      related to higher initial levels of cognitive ability. Higher work stress was 
      related to higher baseline fluid ability. These associations were largely not 
      independent of control variables. Higher social integration at work was related 
      to less steep increase in crystallized intelligence and higher work stress was 
      related to less decline in processing speed. In sum, our findings were more in 
      line with selection rather than with enrichment effects, with the caveat that our 
      findings rely on work variables taken at baseline. We discuss potential 
      mechanisms underlying these findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

TI  - The genomic basis of mood instability: identification of 46 loci in 363,705 UK 
      Biobank participants, genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders, and 
      association with gene expression and function.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychiatric phenotypes have tended to 
      focus on categorical diagnoses, but to understand the biology of mental illness 
      it may be more useful to study traits which cut across traditional boundaries. 
      Here, we report the results of a GWAS of mood instability as a trait in a large 
      population cohort (UK Biobank, n = 363,705). We also assess the clinical and 
      biological relevance of the findings, including whether genetic associations show 
      enrichment for nervous system pathways. Forty six unique loci associated with 
      mood instability were identified with a SNP heritability estimate of 9%. Linkage 
      Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSR) analyses identified genetic correlations 
      with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), Schizophrenia, 
      anxiety, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Gene-level and gene set 
      analyses identified 244 significant genes and 6 enriched gene sets. Tissue 
      expression analysis of the SNP-level data found enrichment in multiple brain 
      regions, and eQTL analyses highlighted an inversion on chromosome 17 plus two 
      brain-specific eQTLs. In addition, we used a Phenotype Linkage Network (PLN) 
      analysis and community analysis to assess for enrichment of nervous system gene 
      sets using mouse orthologue databases. The PLN analysis found enrichment in 
      nervous system PLNs for a community containing serotonin and melatonin receptors. 
      In summary, this work has identified novel loci, tissues and gene sets 
      contributing to mood instability. These findings may be relevant for the 
      identification of novel trans-diagnostic drug targets and could help to inform 
      future stratified medicine innovations in mental health.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the impact of an enriched environment in a 
      previously established stress model of isolation during early development that 
      induces high alcohol (ethanol) self-administration. The study was conducted with 
      male and female C57BL/6J mice housed in isolation or in groups that were either 
      provided or withheld enrichment during adolescence. The impact of these housing 
      conditions was assessed during adulthood by measuring weight gain, quantifying 
      voluntary ethanol intake, measuring plasma corticosterone levels, and assessing 
      anxiety-like behavior. Results showed that, regardless of sex, mice that were 
      single-housed during adolescence showed a significant increase in voluntary 
      ethanol intake, which was not observed in isolated mice that were provided with 
      nesting material during adolescence (compared to group-housed non-enriched 
      control group). Basal corticosterone was not affected by housing, enrichment 
      conditions, or sex. Corticosterone levels did not relate to levels of voluntary 
      ethanol intake. However, corticosterone levels were higher after three weeks of 
      ethanol intake. Surprisingly, mice that were group-housed during adolescence 
      showed higher levels of anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark test. Overall, 
      these results indicate that housing conditions during a critical developmental 
      period can significantly modulate voluntary ethanol intake later in life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term success of ex-situ conservation programmes depends on 
      species-appropriate husbandry and enrichment practices complemented by an 
      accurate welfare assessment protocol. Zoos and conservation breeding programmes 
      should employ a bottom-up approach to account for intraspecific variations in 
      measures of animal welfare. We studied 35 (14:21) captive Asiatic lions in 
      Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Junagadh, India to understand the implications of 
      individual variations on welfare measures. We categorized the subjects based on 
      personality traits (bold or shy), rearing history (wild-rescued or 
      captive-raised), sex, and social-grouping. We explored the association of these 
      categorical variables on welfare indices such as behavioural diversity, latency 
      to approach novel objects, enclosure usage and aberrant repetitive behaviours. 
      Further, we assessed the inter-relationships between different behavioural 
      measures of welfare. RESULTS: Our results show that intraspecific variations 
      based on rearing-history and personality traits are significantly associated with 
      the welfare states of captive Asiatic lions. Asiatic lions with bold personality 
      traits (M = 0.50, SD = 0.12, N = 21) and those raised in captivity 
      (M = 0.47, SD = 0.12, N = 16) used enclosure space more homogenously compared to 
      shy (M = 0.71, SD = 0.15, N = 14) and wild-rescued (M = 0.67, SD = 0.15, N = 19) 
      animals. Behaviour diversity was significantly higher in captive-raised 
      (M = 1.26, SD = 0.3, N = 16) and bold (M = 1.23, SD = 0.26, N = 21) subjects 
      compared to wild-rescued (M = 0.83, SD = 0.35, N = 19) and shy 
      (M = 0.73, SD = 0.34, N = 14) individuals. Aberrant repetitive behaviours 
      (stereotypy) were significantly lower in bold (M = 7.01, SD = 4, N = 21) and 
      captive-raised (M = 7.74, SD = 5.3) individuals compared to wild-rescued 
      (M = 13.12, SD = 6.25, N = 19) and shy (M = 16.13, SD = 5.4, N = 16) lions. Sex 
      and social-grouping of subjects did not show significant associations with 
      behavioural welfare indices. Interestingly, behaviour diversity was reliably 
      predicted by the enclosure usage patterns and aberrant repetitive behaviours 
      displayed by subjects. DISCUSSION: Our findings underline the importance of 
      individual-centric, behaviour-based, and multi-dimensional welfare assessment 
      approaches in ex-situ conservation programmes. The results suggest that 
      behavioural welfare indices complemented with individual variations can explain 
      inter-individual differences in behavioural welfare measure outcomes of Asiatic 
      lions. These findings also provide zoo managers with a non-invasive tool to 
      reliably assess and improve husbandry practices for Asiatic lions. Understanding 
      the unique welfare requirement of individuals in captivity will be crucial for 
      the survival of the species.

TI  - Early-life short-term environmental enrichment counteracts the effects of stress 
      on anxiety-like behavior, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nuclear

AB  - Early life is a decisive stage for the development of physiological and 
      psychological characteristics of an individual. Any stress or disruption of 
      healthy development at this stage has serious long-lasting consequences for the 
      remaining life. Unfortunately, early life stress is a common occurrence in humans 
      and other animals. In this context, we investigated if the provision of 
      environmental enrichment during the pre-weaning phase of rat pups and dams could 
      alter the consequences of early-life maternal-separation stress. Pre-weaning 
      enrichment rescued the effects of maternal separation on the excess secretion of 
      adrenal stress hormones and anxiety-like behavior during adulthood. Enrichment 
      also reduced the effect of stress on the spine density of basolateral amygdala 
      neurons, a brain region critical for stress-induced facilitation of emotional 
      behaviors. Pre-weaning enrichment, provided during early-life, blunted the 
      effects of maternal separation stress on decreased intra-nuclear translocation of 
      glucocorticoid receptors within the amygdala neurons when tested later in 
      adulthood. Early-life, pre-weaning environmental enrichment also increased the 
      amount of brain-derived neurotrophic factor within adult basolateral amygdala. 
      Our observations showed that environmental manipulation during early formative 
      years could be utilized to build lifelong resilience to stress. Complex 
      naturalistic housing and sensory enrichment is, thus, an useful buffer against an 
      impoverished and stressful childhood.

AB  - Moderate levels of anxiety enable individual animals to cope with stressors 
      through avoidance, and could be an adaptive trait. However, repeated stress 
      exacerbates anxiety to pathologically high levels. Dendritic remodeling in the 
      basolateral amygdala is proposed to mediate potentiation of anxiety after stress. 
      Similarly, modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor is thought to be 
      important for the behavioral effects of stress. In the present study, we 
      investigate if relatively short periods of environmental enrichment in adulthood 
      can confer resilience against stress-induced anxiety and concomitant changes in 
      neuronal arborisation and brain derived neurotrophic factor within basolateral 
      amygdala. Two weeks of environmental enrichment countermanded the propensity of 
      increased anxiety following chronic immobilization stress. Environmental 
      enrichment concurrently reduced dendritic branching and spine density of 
      projection neurons of the basolateral amygdala. Moreover, stress increased 
      abundance of BDNF mRNA in the basolateral amygdala in agreement with the 
      dendritic hypertrophy post-stress and role of BDNF in promoting dendritic 
      arborisation. In contrast, environmental enrichment prevented stress-induced rise 
      in the BDNF mRNA abundance. Gain in body weights and adrenal weights remained 
      unaffected by exposure to environmental enrichment. These observations suggest 
      that a short period of environmental enrichment can provide resilience against 
      maladaptive effects of stress on hormonal, neuronal and molecular mediators of 
      anxiogenesis.

TI  - Network pharmacology study on the mechanism of gastrodin reversing depressive 
      symptoms in traumatically stressed rats.
LID - 10.2174/1386207325666220928143206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a typical outcome of the repair of posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to explore the mechanism by which gastrodin 
      (GAS) reverses depressive symptoms in traumatically stressed rats based on 
      network pharmacology and neuropharmacology experiments. METHODS: GAS-related 
      targets were predicted by SwissTargetPrediction; depression-related targets were 
      collected from GeneCards and therapeutic target database (TTD); protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network was constructed with its action mechanism being 
      predicted by gene ontology (GO) analysis and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and 
      genomes (KEGG) enrichment. The animal model of PTSD was replicated by single 
      prolonged stress (SPS). The antidepressant effect of GAS was investigated by the 
      forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The levels of tyrosine 
      hydroxylase (TH) and corticotropin releasing factor type I receptor (CRF1) in 
      locus ceruleus (LC) and the expression of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in 
      the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and central amygdala (CeA) 
      were measured by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: GAS significantly shortened the 
      tail suspension and swimming immobility in SPS rats in TST and FST experiments (p 
      < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The network analysis showed that the critical antidepressant 
      targets of GAS were 86 targets such as GAPDH, CASP3 MMP9, HRAS, DPP4, and TH, 
      which were significantly enriched in the pathways such as pathways neuroactive 
      ligand receptor interaction. High doses of GAS could significantly reduce the 
      level of TH and CRF in CEA in the brain of rats with depressive symptoms (p < 
      0.01) and at the same time, lower the expression of CRF in PVN (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: The effect of GAS on depressive symptoms in SPS rats may be closely 
      related to its reduction of CRF expression in PVN and CeA and inhibition of 
      neuron (NE) synthesis in LC.

TI  - Abnormal response to chronic social defeat stress and fear extinction in a mouse 
      model of cholinergic dysregulation.
LID - rs.3.rs-2492514 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2492514/v1 [doi]
AB  - Cholinergic signaling is critical for an individual to react appropriately and 
      adaptably to salient stimuli while navigating a complex environment. The 
      cholinergic neurotransmitter system drives attention to salient stimuli, such as 
      stressors, and aids in orchestrating the proper neural and behavioral response. 
      Fine-tuned regulation of the cholinergic system has been linked to appropriate 
      stress responses and subsequent mood regulation while dysregulation has been 
      implicated in mood disorders. Among the multiple layers of regulation are 
      cholinergic protein modulators. Here, we use validated models of 
      experiential-based affective disorders to investigate differences in responses to 
      stress in a genetic mouse model of cholinergic dysregulation based on the loss of 
      protein modulator. The lynx2 nicotinic receptor modulatory protein provides 
      negative cholinergic regulation within the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, 
      and other brain regions. We discovered here that lynx2 knockout (KO) mice 
      demonstrate an inability to update behavior with an inability to extinguish 
      learned fear during a fear extinction test. We also observed, under an increased 
      stress load following exposure to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm, 
      there was a unified resilience phenotype in lynx2KO mice, as opposed to the 
      wild-type cohort which was split between resilience and susceptible phenotypes. 
      Furthermore, we provide evidence for the functional role of α7 nicotinic receptor 
      subtypes by phenotypic rescue with MLA or crossing with an α7 null mutant mouse 
      (e.g. lynx2/α7 double KO mice). We demonstrate a direct physical interaction 
      between lynx2 and α7 nAChR by co-immunoprecipitation of complexes from mouse BLA 
      extracts. The genetic predisposition to heightened basal anxiety-like behavior 
      and altered cholinergic signaling impairs individual behavior responses 
      stressors. Together, these data indicate that the effects of social stress can be 
      influenced by baseline genetic factors involved in anxiety regulation.

AB  - Environmental factors play a key role in the etiology of depression. The rodent 
      forced swim test (FST) is commonly used as a preclinical model of depression, 
      with increases in escape-directed behavior reflecting antidepressant effects, and 
      increases in immobility reflecting behavioral despair. Environmental enrichment 
      leads to serotonergic alterations in rats, but it is unknown whether these 
      alterations may influence the efficacy of common antidepressants. Male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were reared in enriched (EC), standard (SC), or isolated (IC) 
      conditions. Following the rearing period, fluoxetine (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) was 
      administered 23.5 hrs, 5 hrs, and 1 hr before locomotor and FST measures. 
      Following locomotor testing and FST exposure, rats were weighed to assess 
      fluoxetine-, FST-, and environmental condition-induced moderations in weight 
      gain. Results revealed an antidepressant effect of environmental enrichment and a 
      depressant effect of isolation. Regardless of significant fluoxetine effects on 
      locomotor activity, fluoxetine generally decreased swimming and increased 
      immobility in all three environmental conditions, with IC-fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) 
      rats and EC-fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) rats swimming less than vehicle counterparts. 
      Subchronic 20 mg/kg fluoxetine also induced significant weight loss, and 
      differential rearing appeared to moderate weight gain following FST stress. These 
      results suggest that differential rearing has the ability to alter FST behaviors, 
      fluoxetine efficacy, and post-stressor well-being. Moreover, 20 mg/kg fluoxetine, 
      administered subchronically, may lead to atypical effects of those commonly 
      observed in the FST, highlighting the importance and impact of both environmental 
      condition and dosing regimen in common animal models of depression.

AB  - Psychological stress and affective disorders are clinically associated with 
      hypertension and vascular disease, but the biological links between the 
      conditions have not been fully explored. To examine this relationship, we used 
      chronic social defeat (CSD) stress, which produces anxiety-like and 
      depressive-like behavioral declines in susceptible mice. In such mice, CSD also 
      produces cerebrovascular microbleeds in scattered locations. Here, we showed 
      further evidence of vascular pathology and blood-brain barrier breakdown by 
      visualizing plasma immunoglobulins and erythrocytes within the parenchyma and 
      perivascular spaces of CSD brains. To further characterize the impact of stress 
      on the cerebrovasculature, brain endothelial cells (bECs) were isolated, and 
      global gene expression profiles were generated. Bioinformatic analysis of 
      CSD-induced transcriptional changes in bECs showed enrichment in pathways that 
      delineate the vascular response to injury. These pathways followed a temporal 
      sequence of inflammation, oxidative stress, growth factor signaling, and wound 
      healing (i.e., platelet aggregation, hemostasis, fibrinogen deposition, and 
      angiogenesis). Immunohistochemical staining for markers of fibrinogen deposition 
      and angiogenesis confirmed the existence of the markers at the sites of vascular 
      disruptions. Recovery after CSD cessation was marked by recruitment of leukocytes 
      perhaps participating in vascular repair. The data suggest that co-morbidity of 
      affective disorders and vascular diseases may be attributed in part to a common 
      link in altered endothelial cell function.

AB  - Rearing young rodents in socially isolated or environmentally enriched conditions 
      has been shown to affect numerous components of the dopamine system as well as 
      behavior. Methylphenidate (MPH), a commonly used dopaminergic agent, may affect 
      animals differently based on rearing environment. Here we examined the 
      interaction between environment and chronic MPH treatment at clinically relevant 
      doses, administered via osmotic minipump. Young Sprague Dawley rats (PND 21) were 
      assigned to environmentally enriched, pair-housed, or socially isolated rearing 
      conditions, and treated with either 0, 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day MPH for 3 weeks. At 
      the end of the treatment period, animals were tested for locomotor activity and 
      anxiety-like behavior. The densities of D1-like and D2-like receptors were 
      measured in the striatum using in vitro receptor autoradiography. Locomotor 
      activity and anxiety-like behavior were increased in isolated animals compared to 
      pair-housed and enriched animals. The density of D1-like receptors was greater in 
      isolated animals, but there were no differences between groups in D2-like 
      receptor density. Finally, there were no effects of MPH administration on any 
      reported measure. This study provides evidence for an effect of early rearing 
      environment on the dopamine system and behavior, and also suggests that MPH 
      administration may not have long-term consequences.

AB  - The persistence of anxiety and the deficit of fear memory extinction are both 
      phenomena related to the symptoms of a trauma-related disorder, such as 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recently we have shown that single acute 
      restraint stress (2 h) in rats induces a late anxiety-related behavior (observed 
      ten days after stress), whereas, in the present work, we found that the same 
      stress impaired fear extinction in animals conditioned ten days after stress. 
      Fourteen days of environmental enrichment (EE) prevented the deleterious effect 
      of stress on fear memory extinction. Additionally, we observed that EE prevented 
      the stress-induced increase in AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit phosphorylation in the 
      hippocampus, but not in the basolateral amygdala complex and the frontal cortex, 
      indicating a potential mechanism by which it exerts its protective effect against 
      the stress-induced behavioral outcome.

TI  - Environmental enrichment and a selective metabotropic glutamate receptor(2/3) 
      (mGluR(2/3)) agonist suppress amphetamine self-administration: Characterizing 
      baseline differences.

AB  - A challenge for developing effective treatments for substance use disorders 
      (SUDs) is understanding how environmental variables alter the efficacy of 
      therapeutics. Environmental enrichment (EC) enhances brain development and 
      protects against behaviors associated with drug abuse vulnerability when compared 
      to rats reared in isolation (IC) or standard conditions (SC). EC rearing enhances 
      the expression and function of metabotropic glutamate receptor(2/3) (mGlurR(2/3)) 
      and activating mGluR(2/3) reduces psychostimulant self-administration (SA). 
      However, the ability for mGluR(2/3) activation to suppress amphetamine (AMP) SA 
      in differentially reared rats is not determined. Therefore, we tested the 
      hypothesis EC reduces AMP (SA) by augmenting mGluR(2/3) function. At postnatal 
      day 21, male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to EC, IC, or SC environments for 
      30 days. Then, they acquired AMP SA and were moved to a progressive ratio (PR) 
      schedule of reinforcement. EC, IC, and SC rats were pretreated with LY379268 
      (vehicle, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg), a selective mGluR(2/3) agonist, before PR behavioral 
      sessions. Linear mixed effects analysis determined EC rats had reduced motivation 
      for AMP SA when compared to IC or SC rats and that LY379268 dose-dependently 
      suppressed AMP SA, but there was no evidence of an interaction. 
      Cumming/Gardner-Altman estimation plots illustrate that the 0.3 mg/kg dose 
      suppressed infusions in EC rats while the 1 mg/kg dose suppressed infusions in SC 
      rats. LY379268 was incapable of suppressing the motivation for AMP SA in IC rats. 
      Controlling for baseline differences in differentially reared rats remains a 
      challenge. Normalizing to a baseline introduced error which is illustrated in the 
      precision of the estimated effect size differences. The data indicate that 
      environmental enrichment enhances the ability of a selective mGluR(2/3) agonist 
      to suppress AMP SA and indicates the functional status of the mGluR(2/3) is 
      formed during development. Therefore, environmental history must be considered 
      when evaluating pharmacological therapeutics particularly those aimed at the 
      mGluR(2/3).

AB  - The hippocampus of rodents undergoes structural remodeling throughout adulthood, 
      including the addition of new neurons. Adult neurogenesis is sensitive to 
      environmental enrichment and stress. Microglia, the brain's resident immune 
      cells, are involved in adult neurogenesis by engulfing dying new neurons. While 
      previous studies using laboratory environmental enrichment have investigated 
      alterations in brain structure and function, they do not provide an adequate 
      reflection of living in the wild, in which stress and environmental instability 
      are common. Here, we compared mice living in standard laboratory settings to mice 
      living in outdoor enclosures to assess the complex interactions among 
      environment, gut infection, and hippocampal plasticity. We infected mice with 
      parasitic worms and studied their effects on adult neurogenesis, microglia, and 
      functions associated with the hippocampus, including cognition and anxiety 
      regulation. We found an increase in immature neuron numbers of mice living in 
      outdoor enclosures regardless of infection. While outdoor living prevented 
      increases in microglial reactivity induced by infection in both the dorsal and 
      ventral hippocampus, outdoor mice with infection had fewer microglia and 
      microglial processes in the ventral hippocampus. We observed no differences in 
      cognitive performance on the hippocampus-dependent object location task between 
      infected and uninfected mice living in either setting. However, we found that 
      infection caused an increase in anxiety-like behavior in the open field test but 
      only in outdoor mice. These findings suggest that living conditions, as well as 
      gut infection, interact to produce complex effects on brain structure and 
      function.

AB  - Deletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and upregulation of 
      indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) are associated with depression severity in 
      animals. The neurotransmitter hypothesis of depression at the transcriptomic 
      level can be tested using BDNF- and IDO1-knockout mouse models and RNA-seq. In 
      this study, BDNF(+/-), IDO1(-/-), and chronic ultra-mild stress (CUMS)-induced 
      depression mouse models and controls were developed, and the differentially 
      expressed genes were analyzed. Furthermore, the ceRNA package was used to search 
      the lncRNA2Target database for potential lncRNAs. Finally, a protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRINGdb. By comparing the 
      control and CUMS model groups, it was found that pathway enrichment analysis and 
      ceRNA network analysis revealed that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      were associated with protection of vulnerable neuronal circuits. In addition, we 
      found the enriched pathways were associated with nervous system development and 
      synapse organization when comparing the control and BDNF(+/-)model groups. When 
      replicating the neurotransmitter disruption features of clinical patients, such 
      comparisons revealed the considerable differences between CUMS and knockdown BDNF 
      models, and the BDNF(+/-)model may be superior to the classic CUMS model. The 
      data obtained in the present study implicated the potential DEGs and their 
      enriched pathway in three mouse models related to depression and the regulation 
      of the ceRNA network-mediated gene in the progression of depression. Together, 
      our findings may be crucial for uncovering the mechanisms underlying the 
      neurotransmitter hypothesis of depression in animals.

AB  - In order to determine the impact of the epigenetic response to traumatic stress 
      on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this study examined longitudinal 
      changes of genome-wide blood DNA methylation profiles in relation to the 
      development of PTSD symptoms in two prospective military cohorts (one discovery 
      and one replication data set). In the first cohort consisting of male Dutch 
      military servicemen (n=93), the emergence of PTSD symptoms over a deployment 
      period to a combat zone was significantly associated with alterations in DNA 
      methylation levels at 17 genomic positions and 12 genomic regions. Evidence for 
      mediation of the relation between combat trauma and PTSD symptoms by longitudinal 
      changes in DNA methylation was observed at several positions and regions. 
      Bioinformatic analyses of the reported associations identified significant 
      enrichment in several pathways relevant for symptoms of PTSD. Targeted analyses 
      of the significant findings from the discovery sample in an independent 
      prospective cohort of male US marines (n=98) replicated the observed relation 
      between decreases in DNA methylation levels and PTSD symptoms at genomic regions 
      in ZFP57, RNF39 and HIST1H2APS2. Together, our study pinpoints three novel 
      genomic regions where longitudinal decreases in DNA methylation across the period 
      of exposure to combat trauma marks susceptibility for PTSD.

      physiological systems, however, the exact mechanisms underlying pathological risk 
      are not fully understood. This knowledge is crucial in developing appropriate 
      therapeutic interventions. The prepubertal period is documented as a key 
      developmental period for the maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain 
      region involved in higher cognitive functions, including social function. In this 
      study, we performed RNA sequencing on the PFC of adult rats who had experienced 
      prepubertal stress (PPS) and controls to investigate the genome-wide consequences 
      of this stress. PPS alters social behaviour in adulthood, therefore we also 
      performed RNA sequencing on PPS and control rats following a social interaction 
      test to determine social activity-dependent gene changes. At a baseline state (1 
      week following a social interaction test), no genes were differentially expressed 
      in the PPS group. However, 1603 genes were differentially expressed in PPS rats 
      compared to controls following a social interaction. These genes were enriched in 
      biological pathways associated with cell signalling and axon myelination 
      dynamics. Cell enrichment analysis showed these genes were associated with 
      oligodendrocytes, and a comparison with an existing early-life stress sequencing 
      dataset showed that pathways linked to oligodendrocyte morphology are impacted in 
      a range of models of early-life stress in rodents. In conclusion, we identify 
      pathways, including those involved in axon myelination, that are differentially 
      activated in the adult in response to social stimulation following PPS. These 
      differential responses may contribute to vulnerability to psychiatric pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a disease that seriously threatens the quality of human 
      life. To explore the effect of gentiopicroside on depression, this study 
      investigated the therapeutic effect of gentiopicroside on corticosterone-induced 
      depressionin vivo and in vitro by using metabolomic methods. METHODS: A total of 
      36 rats were randomly assigned to three groups: a normal group, model group 
      (depression), and treatment group (depression + gentiopicroside). Corticosterone 
      was administrated to induce depression-like model rats. Morris water maze test 
      was used to validated the behavior performance. The hippocampus of rats was 
      obtained for metabolomic detection. Metabolites that were differentially 
      expressed between the groups were extracted for Heatmap, Go, and pathway 
      enrichment analyses. Finally, neuronal cells were cultured and examined to 
      validated the effect of gentiopicroside. RESULTS: Corticosterone injured rats 
      learning capacity, and decreased the levels of 5-HT, and reversed by 
      gentiopicroside delivery. Metabolites obtained from the hippocampus of rats in 
      the three groups were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA). Go and 
      pathway enrichment analyses revealed the involvement of sphingolipid metabolism 
      et al. Gentiopicroside could inhibit apoptosis caused by corticosterone, and also 
      decrease neuronal cell proliferation and BDNF levels in vitro. Arachidonic acid 
      (ARA) reversed the protective effect of gentiopicroside on neuronal cells. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that gentiopicroside reduces apoptosis and 
      increases the proliferation of hippocampus cells in depressed animals by 
      regulating metabolites. Moreover, our study provides a new basis for the clinical 
      treatment of depression and demonstrates the potential efficacy of 
      gentiopicroside in this area of pathology.

AB  - A novel online system including two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to 
      high-resolution mass spectrometry (2D-LC/MS) was developed and applied for 
      comprehensive phospholipid (PL) and sphingomyelin (SM) profiling of dorsal 
      hippocampus (DHPC), ventral (VHPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain regions in a 
      mouse model of anxiety disorder. In the first dimension, lipid classes were 
      distinguished by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), while the 
      second dimensional separation of individual PL and SM species was achieved by 
      reversed-phase (RP) chromatography. For the enrichment of lipid species in 
      diluted HILIC effluent, two RP trapping columns were used separately. The 
      developed fully-automated 2D method allowed the quantitative analysis of over 150 
      endogenous PL and SM species in mouse brain regions within 40min. The developed 
      method was applied in a pilot study, which aimed to find alteration of PL and SM 
      composition in a mouse model of anxiety disorder. In the case of 37 PL and SM 
      species, significant differences were observed between high anxiety-related 
      behavior (AX) and low anxiety-related behavior (nAX) mice. In mice having 
      elevated anxiety, the most typical trend was the downregulation of PL species, in 
      particular, in VHPC.

TI  - Histone Modifications in a Mouse Model of Early Adversities and Panic Disorder: 
      Role for Asic1 and Neurodevelopmental Genes.
PG  - 25131
LID - 10.1038/srep25131 [doi]
LID - 25131
AB  - Hyperventilation following transient, CO2-induced acidosis is ubiquitous in 
      mammals and heritable. In humans, respiratory and emotional hypersensitivity to 
      CO2 marks separation anxiety and panic disorders, and is enhanced by early-life 
      adversities. Mice exposed to the repeated cross-fostering paradigm (RCF) of 
      interference with maternal environment show heightened separation anxiety and 
      hyperventilation to 6% CO2-enriched air. Gene-environment interactions affect CO2 
      hypersensitivity in both humans and mice. We therefore hypothesised that 
      epigenetic modifications and increased expression of genes involved in 
      pH-detection could explain these relationships. Medullae oblongata of RCF- and 
      normally-reared female outbred mice were assessed by ChIP-seq for H3Ac, H3K4me3, 
      H3K27me3 histone modifications, and by SAGE for differential gene expression. 
      Integration of multiple experiments by network analysis revealed an active 
      component of 148 genes pointing to the mTOR signalling pathway and nociception. 
      Among these genes, Asic1 showed heightened mRNA expression, coherent with 
      RCF-mice's respiratory hypersensitivity to CO2 and altered nociception. 
      Functional enrichment and mRNA transcript analyses yielded a consistent picture 
      of enhancement for several genes affecting chemoception, neurodevelopment, and 
      emotionality. Particularly, results with Asic1 support recent human findings with 
      panic and CO2 responses, and provide new perspectives on how early adversities 
      and genes interplay to affect key components of panic and related disorders.

TI  - MicroRNA Regulates Early-Life Stress-Induced Depressive Behavior via Serotonin 
      Signaling in a Sex-Dependent Manner in the Prefrontal Cortex of Rats.
PG  - 180-189
LID - 10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.05.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The underlying neurobiology of early-life stress (ELS)-induced major 
      depressive disorder is not clearly understood. METHODS: In this study, we used 
      maternal separation (MS) as a rodent model of ELS and tested whether microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) target serotonin genes to regulate ELS-induced depression-like behavior 
      and whether this effect is sex dependent. We also examined whether environmental 
      enrichment prevents susceptibility to depression- and anxiety-like behavior 
      following MS and whether enrichment effects are mediated through serotonin genes 
      and their corresponding miRNAs. RESULTS: MS decreased sucrose preference, which 
      was reversed by enrichment. Males also exhibited greater changes in forced swim 
      climbing and escape latency tests only following enrichment. S lc6a4 and H tr1a 
      were upregulated in the frontal cortex following MS. In male MS rats, enrichment 
      slightly reversed H tr1a expression to levels similar to control rats. 
      miR-200a-3p and miR-322-5p, which target SLC6A4, were decreased by MS, but not 
      significantly. An HTR1A-targeting miRNA, miR-320-5p, was also downregulated by MS 
      and showed slight reversal by enrichment in male animals. miR-320-5p targeting of 
      H tr1a was validated in vitro using SHSY neuroblastoma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Altogether, this study implicates miRNA interaction with the serotonin pathway in 
      ELS-induced susceptibility to depression-related reward deficits. Furthermore, 
      because of its recovery by enrichment in males, miR-320 may represent a viable 
      sex-specific target for reward-related deficits in major depressive disorder.

AB  - Many investigations have indicated that prenatal stress (PS) causes 
      depressive-like disturbances in offspring rats. However, the underlying 
      pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. The prefrontal cortex 
      (PFC) has been shown to play a role in susceptibility to stress during fetal 
      development; thus, we focused our attention on differential protein 
      phosphorylation in this region of PS-S (susceptibility to PS) offspring rats. The 
      sucrose preference test was used to screen for susceptibility to PS. The validity 
      of the prenatally stressed model was verified by other common depression-like 
      behaviors. We used MS-based TMT quantitative proteomics in combination with the 
      phosphopeptide enrichment method to compare phosphoproteomic profiling in the PFC 
      of PS-S and control male offspring rats. In total, 3,418 phosphoproteins, 8,404 
      phosphopeptides, and 12,175 phosphosites were identified in this analysis. 
      According to the screening criteria, 902 phosphopeptides increased and 609 
      decreased in the PFC of the PS-S group compared to the control rats. Gene 
      ontology enrichment analysis indicated that the main enriched terms in the 
      cellular component category were "synapse part," "myelin sheath," "synapse," 
      "neuron part," and "axon." The phosphoproteins enriched in the molecular function 
      and biological process categories were mainly related to cytoskeleton- and 
      projection morphogenesis-associated proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analyses 
      identified 30 significant KEGG pathways; the top five pathways included salivary 
      secretion, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, pancreatic 
      secretion, and insulin secretion. Motifs such as ……_S_P…RR, ……S_PE……, ……_S_PV……, 
      ……_S_P.H……, and …S…_S_PT…. were the top five motifs enriched in phosphorylated 
      sites. PS may induce depressive-like behaviors in male offspring rats by 
      regulating the phosphorylation of proteins mainly related to synapses, myelin 
      sheaths, neurons, and the cytoskeleton. The phosphorylation of related proteins 
      may act as key pathogenic hits. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with 
      identifier PXD026563.

TI  - Structural environmental enrichment and the way it is offered influence cognitive 
      judgement bias and anxiety-like behaviours in zebrafish.
PG  - 563-577

AB  - Environmental enrichment in zebrafish generally reduces anxiety-related 
      behaviours, improves learning in maze trials and increases health and biological 
      fitness. However, certain types of enrichment or certain conditions induce the 
      opposite effects. Therefore, it is essential to study the characteristics of 
      environmental enrichment that modulate these effects. This study aims to 
      investigate if structural environmental enrichment and the way it is offered 
      influence cognitive judgement bias and anxiety-like behaviours in adult 
      zebrafish. The fish were assigned to six housing manipulations: constant barren, 
      constant enrichment, gradual gain of enrichment, gradual loss of enrichment, 
      sudden gain of enrichment and sudden loss of enrichment. We then transposed the 
      cognitive judgment bias paradigm, formerly used in studies on other animals to 
      measure the link between emotion and cognition, to objectively assess the impact 
      of these manipulations on the zebrafish's interpretation of ambiguous stimuli, 
      considering previous experiences and related emotional states. We used two 
      battery tests (light/dark and activity tests), which measured anxiety-related 
      behaviours to check if these tests covariate with cognitive bias results. The 
      fish with a sudden gain in enrichment showed a pessimistic bias (interpreted 
      ambiguous stimuli as negative). In addition, the fish that experienced a sudden 
      gain and a gradual loss in enrichment showed more anxiety-like behaviours than 
      the fish that experienced constant conditions or a gradual gain in enrichment. 
      The data provide some proof that structural environmental enrichment and the way 
      it is presented can alter zebrafish's cognitive bias and anxiety-like behaviours.

AB  - Environmental enrichment of laboratory animals influences brain plasticity, 
      stimulates neurogenesis, increases neurotrophic factor expression, and protects 
      against the effects of brain insult. However, these positive effects are not 
      constantly observed, probably because standardized procedures of environmental 
      enrichment are lacking. Therefore, we engineered an enriched cage (the Marlau™ 
      cage), which offers: (1) minimally stressful social interactions; (2) increased 
      voluntary exercise; (3) multiple entertaining activities; (4) cognitive 
      stimulation (maze exploration), and (5) novelty (maze configuration changed three 
      times a week). The maze, which separates food pellet and water bottle 
      compartments, guarantees cognitive stimulation for all animals. Compared to rats 
      raised in groups in conventional cages, rats housed in Marlau™ cages exhibited 
      increased cortical thickness, hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal levels of 
      transcripts encoding various genes involved in tissue plasticity and remodeling. 
      In addition, rats housed in Marlau™ cages exhibited better performances in 
      learning and memory, decreased anxiety-associated behaviors, and better recovery 
      of basal plasma corticosterone level after acute restraint stress. Marlau™ cages 
      also insure inter-experiment reproducibility in spatial learning and brain gene 
      expression assays. Finally, housing rats in Marlau™ cages after severe status 
      epilepticus at weaning prevents the cognitive impairment observed in rats 
      subjected to the same insult and then housed in conventional cages. By providing 
      a standardized enriched environment for rodents during housing, the Marlau™ cage 
      should facilitate the uniformity of environmental enrichment across laboratories.

TI  - Exposure to Patterned Auditory Stimuli during Acute Stress Prevents Despair-Like 
      Behavior in Adult Mice That Were Previously Housed in an Enriched Environment in 
      Combination with Auditory Stimuli.
PG  - 8205245

AB  - Several interventions have been shown to counteract the effects of stress that 
      may be related to improved neuroplasticity and neuronal activation. In this 
      sense, environmental enrichment (ENR) protects against acute stress and increases 
      neuroplasticity. It has been suggested that the use of patterned auditory stimuli 
      (PAS) may be beneficial in increasing the effectiveness of ENR on disorders 
      related to stress, such as depression and anxiety. Examples of PAS are classical 
      music compositions that have interesting effects at both clinical and preclinical 
      levels. Thus, we analyzed the effects of the exposure to PAS, represented in this 
      study by Mozart's compositions, during ENR housing for 35 days in adult male 
      Balb/C mice to evaluate depression-associated behavior using the forced-swim test 
      (FST) paradigm with an additional short exposure to PAS. We found that the ENR 
      mice that were exposed to PAS during both housing and behavioral task 
      (ENR + PAS/FST + PAS) show decreased immobility and the number of despair 
      episodes within a higher latency to show the first bout of immobility. 
      Additionally, we found increased neuronal activation evaluated by the 
      identification of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein- (Arc-) 
      labeled cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice exposed to PAS during 
      housing and in the absence or presence of PAS during FST. Moreover, we found 
      increased neuronal activation in the auditory cortex (AuCx) of mice exposed to 
      PAS during FST. Our study suggests that the exposure to PAS during an emotional 
      challenge decreases despair-like behavior in rodents that were previously housed 
      in an enriched environment in combination with auditory stimuli. Thus, our data 
      indicate that the role of the exposure to PAS as an intervention or in 
      combination with positive environment to aid in treating neuropsychiatric 
      disorders is worth pursuing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeated or continuous chronic psychological stress may induce 
      diverse neuropsychiatric disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms remain 
      unclear. In this study, we explored the expression profiles of long noncoding 
      RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs, along with their biological function and regulatory 
      network, in mice after repeated social defeat (RSD) stress to explore their 
      potential involvement in the development of anxiety-like behaviors. MAIN METHODS: 
      RNA-sequencing was used to screen all differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 
      mRNAs between the RSD and control groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for confirmation of the RNA-sequencing results. The 
      function of DE lncRNAs was predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway 
      analyses of target mRNAs. In addition, the functional regulatory network of the 
      target mRNAs was constructed to reveal potential relationships between lncRNAs 
      and their target genes with bioinformatics approaches. KEY FINDINGS: In mice 
      experiencing RSD, 373 and 454 lncRNAs, along with 1142 and 654, mRNAs were 
      significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The detailed 
      regulatory network included 126 eligible lncRNA-mRNA pairs. Among them, 14 genes 
      such as Arhgef1, Chchd2, Fam107a, Dlg1, Nova2, Dpf1, and Shank3 involved in 
      neurite growth, neural development, and synaptic plasticity were direct targets 
      of the DE lncRNAs. qRT-PCR of four of the DE lncRNAs and mRNAs confirmed the 
      reliability of RNA-sequencing. GO clustering analyses showed that the top 
      enriched biological process, cellular component, and molecular function terms 
      were synaptic transmission, neuron spine, and glutamate receptor binding, 
      respectively. Further, the top three significant enriched pathways were synaptic 
      adhesion-like molecule (SALM) protein interactions at the synapses, trafficking 
      of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, as well 
      as glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors, and synaptic plasticity. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Hundreds of lncRNAs and mRNAs are dysregulated after RSD, and many 
      of these lncRNAs might participate in the development of anxiety-like behaviors 
      via multiple complex mechanisms such as target regulation. Available informatics 
      evidence highlighted the likely role of synapse dysfunction and abnormal synaptic 
      neurotransmission in these behaviors. Thus, our findings provide potential 
      candidate biomarkers or intervention targets for chronic psychological 
      stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders.

TI  - Attachment Style Moderates Polygenic Risk for Posttraumatic Stress in United 
      States Military Veterans: Results From the National Health and Resilience in 
      Veterans Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from genome-wide association 
      studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may inform risk for this 
      disorder. To date, however, no known study has examined whether social 
      environmental factors such as attachment style may moderate the relation between 
      PRS and PTSD. METHODS: We evaluated main and interactive effects of PRS and 
      attachment style on PTSD symptoms in a nationally representative sample of 
      trauma-exposed European-American U.S. military veterans (N = 2030). PRS was 
      derived from a genome-wide association study of PTSD re-experiencing symptoms 
      (N = 146,660) in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Using one-sample Mendelian 
      randomization with data from the UK Biobank (N = 115,099), we evaluated the 
      effects of re-experiencing PRS and attachment style on PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: 
      Higher re-experiencing PRS and secure attachment style were independently 
      associated with PTSD symptoms. A significant PRS-by-attachment style interaction 
      was also observed (β = -.11, p = .006), with a positive association between 
      re-experiencing PRS and PTSD symptoms observed only among veterans with an 
      insecure attachment style. One-sample Mendelian randomization analyses suggested 
      that the association between PTSD symptoms and attachment style is bidirectional. 
      PRS enrichment analyses revealed a significant interaction between attachment 
      style and a variant mapping to the IGSF11 gene (rs151177743, p = 2.1 × 10(-7)), 
      which is implicated in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission and 
      plasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Attachment style may moderate polygenic risk for PTSD 
      symptoms, and a novel locus implicated in synaptic transmission and plasticity 
      may serve as a possible biological mediator of this association. These findings 
      may help inform interpersonally oriented treatments for PTSD for individuals with 
      high polygenic risk for this disorder.

TI  - Histone Lysine Demethylase JMJD2D/KDM4D and Family Members Mediate Effects of 
      Chronic Social Defeat Stress on Mouse Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Mood 
      Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci10110833 [doi]
LID - 833
AB  - Depression, anxiety and related mood disorders are major psychiatric illnesses 
      worldwide, and chronic stress appears to be one of the primary underlying causes. 
      Therapeutics to treat these debilitating disorders without a relapse are limited 
      due to the incomplete molecular understanding of their etiopathology. In addition 
      to the well-studied genetic component, research in the past two decades has 
      implicated diverse epigenetic mechanisms in mediating the negative effects of 
      chronic stressful events on neural circuits. This includes the cognitive 
      circuitry, where the dynamic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis gets 
      affected in depression and related affective disorders. Most of these epigenetic 
      studies have focused on the impact of acetylation/deacetylation and methylation 
      of several histone lysine residues on neural gene expression. However, there is a 
      dearth of investigation into the role of demethylation of these lysine residues 
      in chronic stress-induced changes in neurogenesis that results in altered 
      behaviour. Here, using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm to induce 
      depression and anxiety in C57BL/6 mice and ex vivo DG neural stem/progenitor cell 
      (NSCs/NPCs) culture we show the role of the members of the JMJD2/KDM4 family of 
      histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) in mediating stress-induced changes in DG 
      neurogenesis and mood disorders. The study suggests a critical role of JMJD2D in 
      DG neurogenesis. Altered enrichment of JMJD2D on the promoters of Id2 (inhibitor 
      of differentiation 2) and Sox2 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 2) was observed 
      during proliferation and differentiation of NSCs/NPCs obtained from the DG. This 
      would affect the demethylation of repressive epigenetic mark H3K9, thus 
      activating or repressing these and possibly other genes involved in regulating 
      proliferation and differentiation of DG NSCs/NPCs. Treatment of the NSCs/NPCs 
      culture with Dimethyloxallyl Glycine (DMOG), an inhibitor of JMJDs, led to 
      attenuation in their proliferation capacity. Additionally, systemic 
      administration of DMOG in mice for 10 days induced depression-like and 
      anxiety-like phenotype without any stress exposure.

TI  - Relationship between academic performance, psychological well-being, and coping 
      strategies in medical students.
PG  - 144-52
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Academic performance is a product of the complex environment that 
      surrounds the student, shaped by aspects such as intensity of study, motivation 
      and context of relationships, which affect the academic achievement of 
      individuals. There may be other psychological or emotional factors, such as 
      anxiety, level of psychological well-being, and behavior strategies for effective 
      adaptation to concrete environment demands and their associated emotional stress. 
      OBJECTIVES: This research study aims at determining the level of psychological 
      well-being and coping strategies in students of the Basic Common Cycle of studies 
      leading to an MD degree in the School of Medicine of the National University of 
      Córdoba, Argentina. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is an observational study based 
      on a "Questionnaire on determiners of academic performance", that was answered by 
      374 students. Data was processed using statistical bivariate analysis (p< 0.05) 
      and multiple correspondence factorial analysis. RESULTS: Students with "VG/G 
      (Very Good/Good) performance" show high levels of satisfaction and well-being use 
      direct coping strategies which lead them to "cope with problematic situations" by 
      means of "problem solving". Students with "R/I (Regular/Insufficient) academic 
      performance" declare "dissatisfaction with most aspects of their personalities", 
      feel unable to give a satisfactory response to environment demands, and assume 
      "avoidance behaviors" as coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Student academic 
      performance is associated with psychological well-being, feeling of satisfaction 
      with achievements, and coping with stressful situations.

      Stress.
PG  - 37814
LID - 10.1038/srep37814 [doi]
LID - 37814
AB  - Ancestral stress can program stress sensitivity and health trajectories across 
      multiple generations. While ancestral stress is uncontrollable to the filial 
      generations, it is critical to identify therapies that overcome transgenerational 
      programming. Here we report that prenatal stress in rats generates a 
      transgenerationally heritable endocrine and epigenetic footprint and elevated 
      stress sensitivity which can be alleviated by beneficial experiences in later 
      life. Ancestral stress led to downregulated glucocorticoid receptor and 
      prefrontal cortex neuronal densities along with precocious development of 
      anxiety-like behaviours. Environmental enrichment (EE) during adolescence 
      mitigated endocrine and neuronal markers of stress and improved miR-182 
      expression linked to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 
      (NT-3) regulation in stressed lineages. Thus, EE may serve as a powerful 
      intervention for adverse transgenerational programming through microRNA-mediated 
      regulation of BDNF and NT-3 pathways. The identification of microRNAs that 
      mediate the actions of EE highlights new therapeutic strategies for mental health 
      conditions and psychiatric disease.

AB  - The subgranular zone of the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus contains a pool of 
      neural stem cells that continuously divide and differentiate into functional 
      granule cells. It has been shown that production of new hippocampal neurons is 
      necessary for amelioration of stress-induced behavioral changes by 
      antidepressants in animal models of depression. The survival of newly born 
      hippocampal neurons is decreased by chronic psychosocial stress and increased by 
      exposure to enriched environments. These observations suggest the existence of a 
      link between hippocampal neurogenesis, stress-induced behavioral changes, and the 
      beneficial effects of enriched environment. To show causality, we subjected 
      transgenic mice with conditionally suppressed neurogenesis to psychosocial stress 
      followed by environmental enrichment. First, we showed that repeated social 
      defeat coupled with chronic exposure to an aggressor produces robust and 
      quantifiable indices of submissive and depressive-like behaviors; second, 
      subsequent exposure to an enriched environment led to extinction of the 
      submissive phenotype, while animals exposed to an impoverished environment 
      retained the submissive phenotype; and third, enrichment was not effective in 
      reversing the submissive and depressive-like behaviors in transgenic mice lacking 
      neurogenesis. Our data show two main findings. First, living in an enriched 
      environment is highly effective in extinguishing submissive behavioral traits 
      developed during chronic social stress, and second, these effects are critically 
      dependent on adult neurogenesis, indicating that beneficial behavioral 
      adaptations are dependent on intact adult neurogenesis.

TI  - Early-Life Stress Induces Depression-Like Behavior and Synaptic-Plasticity 
      Changes in a Maternal Separation Rat Model: Gender Difference and Metabolomics 
      Study.

AB  - More than 300 million people suffer from depressive disorders globally. People 
      under early-life stress (ELS) are reportedly vulnerable to depression in their 
      adulthood, and synaptic plasticity can be the molecular mechanism underlying such 
      depression. Herein, we simulated ELS by using a maternal separation (MS) model 
      and evaluated the behavior of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in adulthood through 
      behavioral examination, including sucrose preference, forced swimming, and 
      open-field tests. The behavior tests showed that SD rats in the MS group were 
      more susceptible to depression- and anxiety-like behaviors than did the non-MS 
      (NMS) group. Nissl staining analysis indicated a significant reduction in the 
      number of neurons at the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, including the CA1, 
      CA2, CA3, and DG regions of SD rats in the MS group. Immunohistochemistry results 
      showed that the percentages of synaptophysin-positive area in the prefrontal 
      cortex and hippocampus (including the CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG regions) slice of the 
      MS group significantly decreased compared with those of the NMS group. Western 
      blot analysis was used to assess synaptic-plasticity protein markers, including 
      postsynaptic density 95, synaptophysin, and growth-associated binding protein 43 
      protein expression in the cortex and hippocampus. Results showed that the 
      expression levels of these three proteins in the MS group were significantly 
      lower than those in the NMS group. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed no significant 
      differences in the peak areas of sex hormones and their metabolites, including 
      estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione, estrone, estriol, and 
      5β-dihydrotestosterone. Through the application of nontargeted metabolomics to 
      the overall analysis of differential metabolites, pathway-enrichment results 
      showed the importance of arginine and proline metabolism; pantothenate and CoA 
      biosyntheses; glutathione metabolism; and the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and 
      tryptophan biosynthesis pathways. In summary, the MS model caused adult SD rats 
      to be susceptible to depression, which may regulate synaptic plasticity through 
      arginine and proline metabolism; pantothenate and CoA biosyntheses; glutathione 
      metabolism; and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosyntheses.

TI  - Further validation of the affective bias test for predicting antidepressant and 
      pro-depressant risk: effects of pharmacological and social manipulations in male 
      and female rats.
PG  - 3105-3116
LID - 10.1007/s00213-017-4687-5 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Affective biases are hypothesised to contribute to the cause and 
      treatment of mood disorders. We have previously found that affective biases, 
      associated with learning and memory, are observed following acute treatments with 
      a range of antidepressant and pro-depressant manipulations. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to test if similar biases are observed in male and female Sprague Dawley 
      (SD) rats. We also test whether the stress hormone, corticosterone, induces a 
      negative bias in the affective bias test (ABT) consistent with its putative role 
      in the development of depression. We then use a meta-analysis to compare our 
      findings with data published for the Lister Hooded rats. METHODS: The ABT uses a 
      within-subject study design where animals learn to associate distinct digging 
      substrates, encountered on different days, with the same value food reward. 
      Exposure to one substrate is paired with a treatment manipulation (drug or 
      environmental) and the other with a control condition. A preference test is used 
      to test if the treatment has induced a positive or negative bias. RESULTS: 
      Consistent with previous data, both male and female SD rats exhibit similar 
      positive affective biases following treatment with the antidepressant, 
      venlafaxine, and social play and negative affective biases following FG 7142 
      (benzodiazepine inverse agonist) and social stress. Acute treatment with 
      corticosterone induced a negative bias. CONCLUSIONS: These data add to the 
      translational validity of the ABT and suggest that corticosterone can induce a 
      negative affective bias following acute treatment, an effect which may contribute 
      to its long-term effects on mood.

TI  - Environmental enrichment induces behavioral recovery and enhanced hippocampal

PG  - e11943
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0011943 [doi]
LID - e11943
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be considered the result of 
      a failure to recover after a traumatic experience. Here we studied possible 
      protective and therapeutic aspects of environmental enrichment (with and without 
      a running wheel) in Sprague Dawley rats exposed to an inescapable foot shock 
      procedure (IFS). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: IFS induced long-lasting 
      contextual and non-contextual anxiety, modeling some aspects of PTSD. Even 10 
      weeks after IFS the rats showed reduced locomotion in an open field. The 
      antidepressants imipramine and escitalopram did not improve anxiogenic behavior 
      following IFS. Also the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sodium butyrate did 
      not alleviate the IFS induced immobility. While environmental enrichment (EE) 
      starting two weeks before IFS did not protect the animals from the behavioral 
      effects of the shocks, exposure to EE either immediately after the shock or one 
      week later induced complete recovery three weeks after IFS. In the next set of 
      experiments a running wheel was added to the EE to enable voluntary exercise 
      (EE/VE). This also led to reduced anxiety. Importantly, this behavioral recovery 
      was not due to a loss of memory for the traumatic experience. The behavioral 
      recovery correlated with an increase in cell proliferation in hippocampus, a 
      decrease in the tissue levels of noradrenalin and increased turnover of 5-HT in 
      prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This animal study 
      shows the importance of (physical) exercise in the treatment of psychiatric 
      diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder and points out the possible 
      role of EE in studying the mechanism of recovery from anxiety disorders.

TI  - Environmental enrichment counters cocaine abstinence-induced stress and brain 
      reactivity to cocaine cues but fails to prevent the incubation effect.
PG  - 365-77

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) during a period of forced abstinence attenuates 
      incentive motivational effects of cocaine-paired stimuli. Here we examined 
      whether EE during forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration would 
      prevent time-dependent increases in cue-elicited cocaine-seeking behavior (i.e. 
      the incubation effect). Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine, which was 
      paired with light/tone cues, for 15 days while living in isolated conditions 
      (IC). Controls received yoked saline infusions. Subsequently, rats were assigned 
      to live in either continued IC or EE for either 1 or 21 days of forced abstinence 
      prior to a test for cocaine-seeking behavior. During testing, responding resulted 
      only in presentation of the light/tone cues. Contrary to our prediction, 
      cocaine-seeking behavior increased over time regardless of living condition 
      during abstinence; however, EE attenuated cocaine-seeking behavior relative to IC 
      regardless of length of abstinence. Brains were harvested and trunk blood was 
      collected immediately after the 60-minute test and later assayed. Results 
      indicated that short-term EE elevated hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor and reduced plasma corticosterone compared with IC. Furthermore, 21 days 
      of EE during forced abstinence prevented increases in the cue-elicited amygdala 
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase expression that was observed 
      in IC rats. These findings suggest that EE attenuates incentive motivational 
      effects of cocaine cues through a mechanism other than preventing the incubation 
      effect, perhaps involving reduction of stress and neural activity in response to 
      cocaine-paired cues during acute withdrawal.

AB  - The negative impacts of social isolation and loneliness on health are well 
      documented. However, little is known about their possible biological 
      determinants. In up to 452,302 UK Biobank study participants, we perform 
      genome-wide association study analyses for loneliness and regular participation 
      in social activities. We identify 15 genomic loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 
      loneliness, and demonstrate a likely causal association between adiposity and 
      increased susceptibility to loneliness and depressive symptoms. Further loci were 
      identified for regular attendance at a sports club or gym (N = 6 loci), pub or 
      social club (N = 13) or religious group (N = 18). Across these traits there was 
      strong enrichment for genes expressed in brain regions that control emotional 
      expression and behaviour. We demonstrate aetiological mechanisms specific to each 
      trait, in addition to identifying loci that are pleiotropic across multiple 
      complex traits. Further study of these traits may identify novel modifiable risk 
      factors associated with social withdrawal and isolation.

TI  - The neurogenic effects of an enriched environment and its protection against the

AB  - Because stress may underlie the presence of depressive episodes, strategies to 
      produce protection against or to reverse the effects of stress on neuroplasticity 
      and behavior are relevant. Preclinical studies showed that exposure to stimuli, 
      such as physical activity and environmental enrichment (ENR), produce beneficial 
      effects against stress causing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. 
      Additionally, ENR induces positive effects on neuroplasticity, neurochemistry and 
      behavior at any age of rodents tested. Here, we analyzed whether ENR exposure 
      prevents the development of depressive-like behavior produced by unpredictable, 
      chronic mild stress (CMS) exposure as well as changes in hippocampal neurogenesis 
      in a six-month-old female Balb/C mice, strain that shows low baseline levels of 
      hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice were assigned to one of four groups: (1) normal 
      housing-normal housing (NH-NH), (2) NH-CMS, (3) ENR-NH, or (4) ENR-CMS. The 
      animals were exposed over 46 days to ENR or NH and subsequently to NH or CMS for 
      4 weeks. ENR induces long-term effects protecting against CMS induction of 
      anhedonia and hopelessness behaviors. Independent of housing conditions, ENR 
      increased the number of proliferative cells (Ki67), and CMS decreased the number 
      of proliferative cells. ENR increased the newborn cells (BrdU) and mature 
      phenotypes of neurons; these effects were not changed by CMS exposure. Similarly, 
      the number of doublecortin-positive cells was not affected by CMS in ENR mice, 
      which showed more cells with complex dendrite arborizations. Our study suggests 
      that ENR induces protection against the effects of CMS on behavior and 
      neuroplasticity in six-month-old Balb/C mice.

TI  - Enriched early life experiences reduce adult anxiety-like behavior in rats: a 
      role for insulin-like growth factor 1.
PG  - 11715-23
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3541-12.2013 [doi]
AB  - Early life experiences can affect brain development, contributing to shape 
      interindividual differences in stress vulnerability and anxiety-like behavior. In 
      rodents, high levels of maternal care have long-lasting positive effects on the 
      behavior of the offspring and stress response; post-weaning rearing in an 
      enriched environment (EE) or massage counteract the negative effects of maternal 
      separation or prenatal stressors. We recently found that insulin-like growth 
      factor 1 (IGF-1) is a key mediator of early EE or massage on brain development. 
      Whether early enrichment of experience can induce long-lasting effects on 
      anxiety-like behavior and whether IGF-1 is involved in these effects is not 
      known. We assessed anxiety-like behavior by means of the elevated plus maze in 
      control adult rats and in adult rats subjected to early EE or to massage. We 
      found that both EE and massage reduced adult anxiety-like behavior. Early IGF-1 
      systemic injections in rat pups reared in standard condition mimic the effects of 
      EE and massage, reducing anxiety-like behavior in the adult; blocking early IGF-1 
      action in massaged and EE animals prevents massage and EE effects. In EE and 
      IGF-1-treated animals, we assessed the hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid 
      receptors (GRs) at postnatal day 12 (P12) and P60, finding a significantly higher 
      GR expression at P60 for both treatments. These results suggest that IGF-1 could 
      be involved in mediating the long-lasting effects of early life experiences on 
      vulnerability/resilience to stress in adults.

AB  - While the efficacy of pharmacological interventions to treat depression has been 
      well-studied in animal models, much less work has been done to shed light on how 
      changes in the immediate environment can impact behaviour. Furthermore, most 
      studies have focused on male rodents despite the prevalence of mood disorders in 
      women. In this study, 36 Wistar Kyoto (validated animal model of depression) and 
      36 Wistar (control) female rats were used to examine the effects of environmental 
      manipulation on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours. Animals were assigned to 
      one of three groups: standard (3 rats/cage), enriched (6 rats/cage plus physical 
      enrichment), and isolation (1 rat/cage) housing. The elevated plus maze (EPM) and 
      forced swim test (FST) were conducted prior to, and four weeks after 
      environmental assignment to measure anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviours, 
      respectively. Sucrose preference assessed anhedonia both before and after 
      environmental assignment. Weight was measured every week to monitor weight-gain 
      over time. Post-environment sucrose preference was significantly increased in 
      animals in enriched housing as compared to those in isolated housing in both 
      strains. While there were significant differences between strains in measures of 
      open arm duration in the EPM and immobility in the FST, there appeared to be no 
      differences between environmental groups. The results of this study highlight the 
      importance of environmental factors in the expression of anhedonia. Enrichment 
      appears to reduce anhedonia while isolation increases anhedonia. These effects 
      should be studied further to assess whether longer periods of social and physical 
      enrichment alleviate other symptoms of depression.

      deficits including increased drug addiction risk. Previous studies have shown 
      that rearing environment plays a significant role in impacting addiction risk. In 
      the present study, we investigated if environmental enrichment during development 
      could be effective in lowering the PE-induced increase in addiction risk. To 
      simulate heavy drinking during pregnancy in humans, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats 
      received ethanol (6 g/kg/day) or vehicle through intragastric gavage on gestation 
      days 8-20. After weaning, the offspring were reared in either an enriched 
      environment (EE) including neonatal handling and complex housing or an 
      impoverished environment (IE) consisting of barren, single housing. Adult male 
      offspring were then tested for locomotion, performance on the elevated plus maze, 
      and amphetamine self-administration under a progressive ratio reinforcement 
      schedule. Overall, EE rats, compared to IE rats, showed reduced locomotor 
      activity in a novel environment and lower levels of anxiety, irrespective of 
      prenatal treatments. Prenatal ethanol exposure increased amphetamine 
      self-administration at both doses tested (0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg/infusion) and in 
      each case EE, relative to IE, reversed this effect. These findings suggest that 
      postnatal environmental complexity plays a determining role in addiction risk 
      after PE.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric disease following 
      exposure to a severe traumatic event or physiological stress, which is 
      characterized by anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. 
      However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons 
      that are susceptible to oxidative stress are a subset of inhibitory GABAergic 
      neurons regulating the excitability of pyramidal neurons, while dysfunction of PV 
      interneurons is casually linked to many mental disorders including PTSD. We 
      therefore hypothesized that environmental enrichment (EE), a method of enhanced 
      cognitive, sensory and motor stimulation, can reverse the behavioral impairments 
      by normalizing PV interneurons in a rat model of PTSD induced by inescapable foot 
      shocks (IFS). Behavioral changes were determined by the open field, elevated plus 
      maze, fear conditioning, and Morris water maze tests. The levels of nicotinamide 
      adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2), NOX4, PV, glutamic 
      acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD-67), and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in the 
      hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were determined. Our results showed that in 
      this PTSD model, rats displayed the anxiety-like behavior, enhanced fear learning 
      behavior, and hippocampus- dependent spatial memory deficit, which were 
      accompanied by the up-regulation of NOX2, 8-OH-dG, and down-regulation of PV and 
      GAD-67. Notably, EE reversed all these abnormalities. These results suggest that 
      restoration of PV interneurons by inhibiting oxidative stress in the hippocampus 
      and prefrontal cortex might represent a mechanism through which EE reverses the 
      behavioral impairments in a rat model of PTSD induced by IFS.

AB  - Until recently, there were few rodent models available to study the interaction 
      of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug taking. Like PTSD, single 
      prolonged stress (SPS) produces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      dysfunction and alters psychostimulant self-administration. Other stressors, such 
      as isolation stress, also alter psychostimulant self-administration. However, it 
      is currently unknown if isolation housing combined with SPS can alter the 
      acquisition or maintenance of cocaine self-administration. The current study 
      applied modified SPS (modSPS; two hours restraint immediately followed by cold 
      swim stress) to rats raised in an isolation condition (Iso), enrichment condition 
      (Enr), or standard condition (Std) to measure changes in cocaine 
      self-administration and HPA markers. Regardless of rearing condition, rats 
      exposed to modSPS had greater corticosterone (CORT) release and reduced cocaine 
      self-administration during initial acquisition compared to non-stressed controls. 
      In addition, during initial acquisition, rats that received both Iso rearing and 
      modSPS showed a more rapid increase in cocaine self-administration across 
      sessions compared to Enr and Std rats exposed to modSPS. Following initial 
      acquisition, a dose response analysis showed that Iso rats were overall most 
      sensitive to changes in cocaine unit dose; however, modSPS had no effect on the 
      cocaine dose response curve. Further, there was no effect of either modSPS or 
      differential rearing on expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in 
      hypothalamus, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, or nucleus accumbens. By using 
      modSPS in combination with Iso housing, this study identified unique 
      contributions of each stressor to acquisition of cocaine self-administration.

TI  - Targeted Epigenetic Remodeling of the Cdk5 Gene in Nucleus Accumbens Regulates 
      Cocaine- and Stress-Evoked Behavior.
PG  - 4690-7
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0013-16.2016 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have implicated epigenetic remodeling in brain reward regions 
      following psychostimulant or stress exposure. It has only recently become 
      possible to target a given type of epigenetic remodeling to a single gene of 
      interest, and to probe the functional relevance of such regulation to 
      neuropsychiatric disease. We sought to examine the role of histone modifications 
      at the murine Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) locus, given growing evidence of 
      Cdk5 expression in nucleus accumbens (NAc) influencing reward-related behaviors. 
      Viral-mediated delivery of engineered zinc finger proteins (ZFP) targeted histone 
      H3 lysine 9/14 acetylation (H3K9/14ac), a transcriptionally active mark, or 
      histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), which is associated with 
      transcriptional repression, specifically to the Cdk5 locus in NAc in vivo We 
      found that Cdk5-ZFP transcription factors are sufficient to bidirectionally 
      regulate Cdk5 gene expression via enrichment of their respective histone 
      modifications. We examined the behavioral consequences of this epigenetic 
      remodeling and found that Cdk5-targeted H3K9/14ac increased cocaine-induced 
      locomotor behavior, as well as resilience to social stress. Conversely, 
      Cdk5-targeted H3K9me2 attenuated both cocaine-induced locomotor behavior and 
      conditioned place preference, but had no effect on stress-induced social 
      avoidance behavior. The current study provides evidence for the causal role of 
      Cdk5 epigenetic remodeling in NAc in Cdk5 gene expression and in the control of 
      reward and stress responses. Moreover, these data are especially compelling given 
      that previous work demonstrated opposite behavioral phenotypes compared with 
      those reported here upon Cdk5 overexpression or knockdown, demonstrating the 
      importance of targeted epigenetic remodeling tools for studying more subtle 
      molecular changes that contribute to neuropsychiatric disease. SIGNIFICANCE 
      STATEMENT: Addiction and depression are highly heritable diseases, yet it has 
      been difficult to identify gene sequence variations that underlie this 
      heritability. Gene regulation via epigenetic remodeling is an additional 
      mechanism contributing to the neurobiological basis of drug and stress exposure. 
      In particular, epigenetic regulation of the Cdk5 gene alters responses to cocaine 
      and stress in mouse and rat models. In this study, we used a novel technology, 
      zinc-finger engineered transcription factors, to remodel histone proteins 
      specifically at the Cdk5 gene. We found that this is sufficient to regulate the 
      expression of Cdk5 and results in altered behavioral responses to cocaine and 
      social stress. These data provide compelling evidence of the significance of 
      epigenetic regulation in the neurobiological basis of reward- and stress-related 
      neuropsychiatric disease.

AB  - Our prior research has shown that environmental enrichment (i.e. rats reared in 
      an environment with novel objects, social contact with conspecifics) produces a 
      protective antidepressant-like phenotype in rats and decreases neurobiological 
      effects of acute psychological stress. Although CREB activity has been identified 
      as a major player, the downstream molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. 
      Thus, the current study investigates proteomic differences in the accumbens of 
      rats raised in an enriched condition (EC) versus those raised in an isolated 
      control condition (IC) under basal conditions and after 30 min of acute restraint 
      stress. Results showed that under basal conditions, EC rats generally expressed 
      less mitochondria-related proteins, particularly those involved in TCA cycle and 
      electron transport compared to IC rats. After 30 min of acute stress, EC rats 
      displayed increased expression of energy metabolism enzymes (among others) while 
      IC rats exhibited decreased expression of similar proteins. Further, network and 
      pathway analyses also identified links to AKT signaling proteins, 14-3-3 family 
      proteins, heat-shock proteins, and ubiquitin-interacting proteins. The protein 
      ENO1 showed marked differential expression and regulation; EC rats expressed 
      higher levels under basal conditions that increased subsequent to stress, while 
      the basal IC expression was lower and decreased further still after stress. The 
      results of this study define differential protein expression in a protective rat 
      model for major depression and additionally identify a dynamic and coordinated 
      differential response to acute stress between the two groups. These results 
      provide new avenues for exploration of the molecular determinants of depression 
      and the response to acute stress.

AB  - Adjunct α2-adrenoceptor antagonism is a potential strategy to accelerate the 
      behavioral effects of antidepressants. Co-administration of the α2-adrenoceptor 
      antagonist yohimbine hastens the behavioral and neurogenic effects of the 
      antidepressant imipramine. We examined the transcriptional targets of short 
      duration (7days), combination treatment of yohimbine and imipramine (Y+I) within 
      the adult rat hippocampus. Using microarray and qPCR analysis we observed 
      functional enrichment of genes involved in intracellular signaling cascades, 
      plasma membrane, cellular metal ion homeostasis, multicellular stress responses 
      and neuropeptide signaling pathways in the Y+I transcriptome. We noted reduced 
      expression of the α2A-adrenoceptor (Adra2a), serotonin 5HT2C receptor (Htr2c) and 
      the somatostatin receptor 1 (Sstr1), which modulate antidepressant action. 
      Further, we noted a regulation of signaling pathway genes like inositol 
      monophosphatase 2 (Impa2), iodothyronine deiodinase 3 (Dio3), regulator of 
      G-protein signaling 4 (Rgs4), alkaline ceramidase 2 (Acer2), doublecortin-like 
      kinase 2 (Dclk2), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in 
      B-cells inhibitor, alpha (Nfkbia) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 
      (Sgk1), several of which are implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. 
      Comparative analysis revealed an overlap in the hippocampal regulation of Acer2, 
      Nfkbia, Sgk1 and Impa2 between Y+I treatment, the fast-acting electroconvulsive 
      seizure (ECS) paradigm, and the slow-onset chronic (21days) imipramine treatment. 
      Further, Y+I treatment enhanced the quiescent neural progenitor pool in the 
      hippocampal neurogenic niche similar to ECS, and distinct from chronic imipramine 
      treatment. Taken together, our results provide insight into the molecular and 
      cellular targets of short duration Y+I treatment, and identify potential leads 
      for the development of rapid-action antidepressants.

AB  - Developing reliable mouse models for social behaviour is challenging. Different 
      tests have been proposed, but most of them consist of rather artificial 
      confrontations of unfamiliar mice in novel arenas or are relying on social stress 
      induced by aggressive conspecifics. Natural social interaction in home cage in 
      laboratory has not been investigated well. IntelliCage is a fully automated 
      home-cage system, where activity of the group-housed mice can be monitored along 
      with various cognitive tasks. Here we report the behavioural profile of C57BL/6N 
      (B6) and BALB/c (BALB) female mice in IntelliCage when separated by strain, 
      followed by monitoring of activity and formation of 'home-base' after mixing two 
      strains. For that purpose, 3 cages were connected. Significant differences 
      between the strains were established in baseline behaviour in conventional tests 
      and in IntelliCage. The B6 mice showed reduced anxiety-like behaviour in open 
      field and light-dark box, slightly enhanced exploratory activity in IntelliCage 
      during initial adaptation and clearly distinct circadian activity. Mixing of two 
      strains resulted in reduction of body weight and anhedonia in B6 mice. In 
      addition, the B6 mice showed clear preference to previous home-cage, and formed a 
      new home-base faster than BALB mice. In contrast, BALB mice showed enhanced 
      activity and moving between the cages without showing any preference to previous 
      home-cage. It could be argued that social challenge caused changes in both 
      strains and different coping styles are responsible for behavioural 
      manifestations. Altogether, this approach could be useful in modelling and 
      validating mouse models for disorders with disturbed social behaviour.

TI  - Rapastinel (GLYX-13) has therapeutic potential for the treatment of

AB  - Rapastinel (GLYX-13) is a NMDA receptor modulator with glycine-site partial 
      agonist properties. It is a robust cognitive enhancer and shows rapid and 
      long-lasting antidepressant properties in both animal models and in humans. 
      Contextual fear extinction (CFE) in rodents has been well characterized and used 
      extensively as a model to study the neurobiological mechanisms of post-traumatic 
      stress disorder (PTSD). Since CFE is NMDA receptor modulated and neural circuitry 
      in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) regulates both depression and PTSD, 
      studies were undertaken to examine the effects of rapastinel for its therapeutic 
      potential in PTSD and to use rapastinel as a tool to study its underlying 
      glutamatergic mechanisms. A 21-day chronic mild unpredictable stress (CUS) rat 
      model was used to model depression and PTSD. The effects of CUS alone compared to 
      No CUS controls, and the effects of rapastinel (3 mg/kg IV) on CUS-treated 
      animals were examined. The effect of rapastinel was first assessed using 
      CUS-treated rats in three depression models, Porsolt, sucrose preference, and 
      novelty-induced hypophagia tests, and found to produce a complete reversal of the 
      depressive-like state in each model. Rapastinel was then assessed in a 
      MPFC-dependent positive emotional learning paradigm and in CFE and again a 
      reversal of the impairments induced by CUS treatment was observed. Both synaptic 
      plasticity and metaplasticity, as measured by the induction of long-term 
      potentiation in rat MPFC slice preparations, was found to be markedly impaired in 
      CUS-treated animals. This impairment was reversed when CUS-treated rats were 
      administered rapastinel and tested 24 h later. Transcriptomic analysis of MPFC 
      mRNA expression in CUS-treated rats corroborated the link between rapastinel's 
      behavioral effects and synaptic plasticity. A marked enrichment in both the LTP 
      and LTD connectomes in rapastinel-treated CUS rats was observed compared to 
      CUS-treated controls. The effects of rapastinel on depression models, PEL, and 
      most importantly on CFE demonstrate the therapeutic potential of rapastinel for 
      the treatment of PTSD. Moreover, rapastinel appears to elicit its therapeutic 
      effects through a NMDA receptor-mediated, LTP-like, metaplasticity process in the 
      MPFC.

TI  - Environmental enrichment confers stress resiliency to social defeat through an 
      infralimbic cortex-dependent neuroanatomical pathway.
PG  - 6159-73

AB  - Enriched environmental (EE) housing dampens stress-induced alterations in 
      neurobiological systems, promotes adaptability, and extinguishes submissive 
      behavioral traits developed during social defeat stress (SD). In the present 
      study, we hypothesized that enrichment before SD can confer stress resiliency 
      and, furthermore, that neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is 
      requisite for this resiliency. To test these hypotheses, mice were housed in EE, 
      standard (SE), or impoverished (IE) housing and then exposed to SD. EE conferred 
      resilience to SD as measured in several behavioral tasks. EE-housed mice 
      expressed elevated FosB/ΔFosB immunostaining in areas associated with emotional 
      regulation and reward processing, i.e., infralimbic, prelimbic, and anterior 
      cingulate cortices, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, and this expression was 
      mostly preserved in mice receiving EE followed by SD. In contrast, in SE- or 
      IE-housed animals, SD increased maladaptive behaviors and greatly reduced 
      FosB/ΔFosB staining in the forebrain. We tested the putative involvement of the 
      PFC in mediating resilience by lesioning individual regions of the PFC either 
      before or after EE housing and then exposing the mice to SD. We found that 
      discrete lesions of the infralimbic but not prelimbic or cingulate cortex made 
      before but not after EE abolished the behavioral resiliency to stress afforded by 
      EE and attenuated FosB/ΔFosB expression in the accumbens and amygdala while 
      increasing it in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. These data suggest 
      that pathological ventromedial PFC outputs to downstream limbic targets could 
      predispose an individual to anxiety disorders in stressful situations, whereas 
      enhanced ventromedial PFC outputs could convey stress resilience.

TI  - Lack of fear response in mice (Mus musculus) exposed to human urine odor.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - A goal of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals is to improve 
      animal welfare by minimizing sources of fear, anxiety, and stress. As a result, 
      it includes recommendations on overcrowding, frequency of cage changes, 
      enrichment, and group housing. However, human odorants are a potential but 
      unexplored source of fear, anxiety, and stress. Although mice have been 
      maintained for decades for animal research, whether mice perceive humans as 
      predators is unknown. If so, this would necessitate changes in animal care and 
      use procedures to minimize this source of chronic fear, anxiety, and stress. 
      Odorants from predator urine are well known to elicit strong fear responses in 
      mice, leading to modification of animal behavior and elevated levels of stress. 
      To begin asking whether human odors influence mouse behavior, we tested the 
      effect of human urine odor on fear response in mice. We assessed mouse behavior 
      by using a modified shuttle cage to record various parameters of mouse exposure 
      to odorants. We found that mice displayed fear responses to 
      2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, a synthetic analog of red fox feces, but no fear 
      response to DMSO, the diluent for 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline. In contrast, mice 
      exposed to human urine samples showed no significant fear response.

TI  - Anticonvulsant and Neuroprotective Effects of Dexmedetomidine on 
      Pilocarpine-Induced Status Epilepticus in Rats Using a Metabolomics Approach.
PG  - 2066-2078
LID - 10.12659/MSM.912283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Status epilepticus (SE) is the most extreme form of seizure. It is a 
      medical and neurological emergency that requires prompt and appropriate treatment 
      and early neuroprotection. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is mainly used for its sedative, 
      analgesic, anxiolytic, and neuroprotective effects with light respiratory 
      depression. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively analyze the 
      metabolic events associated with anticonvulsion and neuroprotection of DEX on 
      pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus rats by LC-MS/MS-based on metabolomics 
      methods combined with histopathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this research, rats 
      were divided into 3 groups: a normal group, an SE group, and an SE+DEX group. 
      Hippocampus of rats from each group were collected for further LC-MS/MS-based 
      metabolomic analysis. We collected brains for HE staining and Nissl staining. 
      Multivariate analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed. RESULTS 
      Results of metabolic profiles of the hippocampus tissues of rats proved that 
      dexmedetomidine relieved rats suffering from the status epilepticus by restoring 
      the damaged neuromodulatory metabolism and neurotransmitters, reducing the 
      disturbance in energy, improving oxidative stress, and alleviating nucleic acid 
      metabolism and amino acid in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus rats. 
      CONCLUSIONS This integral metabolomics research provides an extremely effective 
      method to access the therapeutic effects of DEX. This research will further 
      development of new treats for status epilepticus and provide new insights into 
      the anticonvulsive and neuroprotective effects of DEX on status epilepticus.

AB  - Emotion dysregulation has been implicated as a risk factor for many psychiatric 
      conditions. Therefore, examining genetic risk associated with emotion 
      dysregulation could help inform cross-disorder risk more generally. A genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS) of emotion dysregulation using single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) array technology was conducted in a highly traumatized, 
      minority, urban sample (N = 2600, males = 774). Post-hoc analyses examined 
      associations between SNPs identified in the GWAS and current depression, 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and history of suicide attempt. Methylation 
      quantitative trait loci were identified and gene set enrichment analyses were 
      used to broadly determine biological processes involved with these SNPs. Among 
      males, SNP rs6602398, located within the interleukin receptor 2A gene, IL2RA, was 
      significantly associated with emotion dysregulation (p = 1.1 × 10(-8)). Logistic 
      regression analyses revealed this SNP was significantly associated with 
      depression (Exp(B) = 2.67, p < 0.001) and PTSD (Exp(B) = 2.07, p < 0.01). This 
      SNP was associated with differential DNA methylation (p < 0.05) suggesting it may 
      be functionally active. Finally, through gene set enrichment analyses, ten 
      psychiatric disease pathways (adjusted p < 0.01) and the calcium signaling 
      pathway (adjusted p = 0.008) were significantly associated with emotion 
      dysregulation. We found initial evidence for an association between emotion 
      dysregulation and genetic risk loci that have already been implicated in medical 
      disorders that have high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. Our results 
      provide further evidence that emotion dysregulation can be understood as a 
      potential psychiatric cross-disorder risk factor, and that sex differences across 
      these phenotypes may be critical. Continued research into genetic and biological 
      risk associated with emotion dysregulation is needed.

AB  - In previous studies we employed multiple behavior assays, including propensity to 
      feed, simulated trawl capture and escape response, to prove the presence of bold 
      and shy personality (BP,SP) in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). However, 
      the molecular mechanism of the different personality has not been elucidated. In 
      this study, firstly, we found that the SP flounder had lower red blood cell count 
      (RBC) and haemoglobin concentration (HBG) than BP flounder. Secondly, the 
      transcriptomic profiles of the hindbrain in flounder with distinct personality 
      were compared. A total of 144 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, 
      including 70 up-regulated and 74 down-regulated genes in SP flounder compared 
      with BP flounder. Genes involved in hypoxia stress were detected in SP flounder, 
      accompanied with down-regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis. In addition, genes 
      related with calcium signaling pathway, including endothelin, b-Fos, c-Fos and 
      c-Jun were up-regulated in SP flounder. Furthermore, personality-related genes 
      including UI, CCK, c-Fos showed significantly higher level in SP flounder than in 
      BP flounder. GO enrichment analysis indicated that the GO categories "the tight 
      junction pathway" and "lipid transport or localization pathway" were enriched in 
      SP flounder, suggesting that the central nervous system homeostasis would be 
      compromised. Thirdly, using a simple and scalable DNA methylation profiling 
      method (MethylRAD), which allows for methylation analysis for DEGs in RNA-seq, we 
      found that only part of gene expression was negatively associated with promoter 
      methylation. Altogether, our study will not only lay a foundation for further 
      studies on animal personality but also facilitate the selective breeding of olive 
      flounder in aquaculture.

      Serotonergic and Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-Ergic System in Indian Field Mouse (Mus

AB  - Exposure to a predator elicits an innate fear response and mimics several 
      behavioral disorders related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 
      protective role of an enriched condition (EC) against psychogenic stressors in 
      various animal models has been well documented. However, this condition has not 
      been tested in field mice in the context of PTSD. In this study, we show that 
      field mice (Mus booduga) housed under EC exhibit predominantly proactive and less 
      reactive behavior compared with mice housed under standard conditions (SC) during 
      exposure to their natural predator (field rat Rattus rattus). Furthermore, we 
      observed that EC mice displayed less anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus 
      maze (EPM) and light/dark-box after exposure to the predator (7 hrs/7 days). In 
      EC mice, predator exposure elevated the level of serotonin (5-Hydroxytrypamine, 
      [5-HT]) in the amygdala as part of the coping response. Subsequently, the 
      serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5-HT1A receptor were up-regulated significantly, 
      but the same did not occur in the 5-HT2C receptor, which is associated with the 
      activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKII) and a transcription 
      factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Our results show that 
      predator exposure induced the activation of CaMKII/CREB, which is accompanied 
      with increased levels of histone acetylation (H3, H4) and decreased histone 
      deacetylases (HDAC1, 2). Subsequently, in the amygdala, the transcription of 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 
      receptor were up-regulated, whereas the Y2 receptor was down-regulated. 
      Therefore, EC facilitated a coping response against a fear associated cue in a 
      PTSD animal model and reduced anxiety by differentially activating serotonergic 
      and NPY-ergic systems.

AB  - Adult women are twice as likely as men to suffer from affective and anxiety 
      disorders, although the mechanisms underlying heightened female stress 
      susceptibility are incompletely understood. Recent findings in mouse Nucleus 
      Accumbens (NAc) suggest a role for DNA methylation-driven sex differences in 
      genome-wide transcriptional profiles. However, the role of another epigenetic 
      process-microRNA (miR) regulation-has yet to be explored. We exposed male and 
      female mice to Subchronic Variable Stress (SCVS), a stress paradigm that produces 
      depression-like behavior in female, but not male, mice, and performed next 
      generation mRNA and miR sequencing on NAc tissue. We applied a combination of 
      differential expression, miR-mRNA network and functional enrichment analyses to 
      characterize the transcriptional and post-transcriptional landscape of sex 
      differences in NAc stress response. We find that male and female mice exhibit 
      largely non-overlapping miR and mRNA profiles following SCVS. The two sexes also 
      show enrichment of different molecular pathways and functions. Collectively, our 
      results suggest that males and females mount fundamentally different 
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional responses to SCVS and engage 
      sex-specific molecular processes following stress. These findings have 
      implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of stress-related disorders in 
      women.

AB  - Fructose consumption, which promotes insulin resistance, hypertension, and 
      dyslipidemia, has increased by over 25% since the 1970s. In addition to metabolic 
      dysregulation, fructose ingestion stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis leading to elevations in glucocorticoids. Adolescents are the greatest 
      consumers of fructose, and adolescence is a critical period for maturation of the 
      HPA axis. Repeated consumption of high levels of fructose during adolescence has 
      the potential to promote long-term dysregulation of the stress response. 
      Therefore, we determined the extent to which consumption of a diet high in 
      fructose affected behavior, serum corticosterone, and hypothalamic gene 
      expression using a whole-transcriptomics approach. In addition, we examined the 
      potential of a high-fructose diet to interact with exposure to chronic adolescent 
      stress. Male Wistar rats fed the periadolescent high-fructose diet showed 
      increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and depressive-like 
      behavior in the forced swim test in adulthood, irrespective of stress history. 
      Periadolescent fructose-fed rats also exhibited elevated basal corticosterone 
      concentrations relative to their chow-fed peers. These behavioral and hormonal 
      responses to the high-fructose diet did not occur in rats fed fructose during 
      adulthood only. Finally, rats fed the high-fructose diet throughout development 
      underwent marked hypothalamic transcript expression remodeling, with 966 genes 
      (5.6%) significantly altered and a pronounced enrichment of significantly altered 
      transcripts in several pathways relating to regulation of the HPA axis. 
      Collectively, the data presented herein indicate that diet, specifically one high 
      in fructose, has the potential to alter behavior, HPA axis function, and the 
      hypothalamic transcriptome in male rats.

      Effect on cat odor exposition and GABAergic interneurons.

AB  - The use of more ethological animal models to study the neurobiology of anxiety 
      has increased in recent years. We assessed the effect of an environmental 
      enrichment (EE) protocol (24h/day over a period of two months) on anxiety-related 
      behaviors when aged Wistar rats (21months old) were confronted with cat odor 
      stimuli. Owing to the relationship between GABAergic interneurons and the 
      anxiety-related neuronal network, we examined changes in the expression of 
      Parvalbumin (PV) and 67kDa form of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-67) 
      immunoreactive cells in different brain regions involved in stress response. 
      Behavioral results revealed that enriched rats traveled further and made more 
      grooming behaviors during the habituation session. In the cat odor session, they 
      traveled longer distances and they showed more active interaction with the odor 
      stimuli and less time in freezing behavior. Zone analysis revealed that the 
      enriched group spent more time in the intermediate zone according to the 
      proximity of the predator odor. Regarding the neurobiological data, the EE 
      increased the expression of PV-positive cells in some medial prefrontal regions 
      (cingulate (Cg) and prelimbic (PL) cortices), whereas the GAD-67 expression in 
      the basolateral amygdala was reduced in the enriched group. Our results suggest 
      that EE is able to reduce anxiety-like behaviors in aged animals even when 
      ethologically relevant stimuli are used. Moreover, GABAergic interneurons could 
      be involved in mediating this resilient behavior.

AB  - Life-threatening experiences can result in the development of post-traumatic 
      stress disorder. We have developed an animal model for post-traumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) using a shuttle box in rats. In this paradigm, the rats were 
      exposed to inescapable foot-shock stress (IS) in a shuttle box, and then an 
      avoidance/escape task was performed in the same box 2 weeks after IS. A previous 
      study using this paradigm revealed that environmental enrichment (EE) ameliorated 
      avoidance/numbing-like behaviors, but not hyperarousal-like behaviors, and EE 
      also elevated hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. 
      However, the differential effects of EE components, i.e., running wheel (RW) or 
      toy rotation, on PTSD-like behaviors has remained unclear. In this experiment, we 
      demonstrated that RW, toy rotation, and EE (containing RW and toy rotation) 
      ameliorated avoidance/numbing-like behaviors, induced learning of avoidance 
      responses, and improved depressive-like behaviors in traumatized rats. The RW 
      increased the hippocampal mRNA expression of neurotrophic factors, especially 
      BDNF and glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor. Toy rotation influenced FK506 
      binding protein 5 mRNA expression, which is believed to be a regulator of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis system, in the hippocampus and 
      amygdala. This is the first report to elucidate the differential mechanistic 
      effects of RW and toy rotation. The former appears to exert its effects via 
      neurotrophic factors, while the latter exerts its effects via the HPA axis. 
      Further studies will lead to a better understanding of the influence of 
      environmental factors on PTSD.

TI  - The differential impact of social defeat on mice living in isolation or groups in 
      an enriched environment: plasma corticosterone and monoamine variations.
PG  - 351-63
LID - 10.1017/S1461145712000120 [doi]
AB  - Social defeat in mice is a potent stressor that promotes the development of 
      depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours, as well as variations of neuroendocrine 
      and brain neurotransmitter activity. Although environmental enrichment may 
      protect against some of the adverse behavioural and biological effects of social 
      defeat, it seems that, among male group-housed mice maintained in an enriched 
      environment (EE), aggressive behaviours may be more readily instigated, thus 
      promoting distress and exacerbating psychopathological features. Thus, although 
      an EE can potentially have numerous beneficial effects, these may depend on the 
      general conditions in which mice were raised. It was observed in the current 
      investigations that EE group-housed BALB/cByJ mice displayed increased 
      anxiety-like behaviours compared to their counterparts maintained in a standard 
      environment (SE). Furthermore, in response to social defeat, EE group-housed male 
      mice exhibited decreased weight gain, exaggerated corticosterone elevations and 
      altered hippocampal norepinephrine utilization compared to their SE counterparts. 
      These effects were not apparent in the individually housed EE mice and, in fact, 
      enrichment among these mice appeared to buffer against serotonin changes induced 
      by social defeat. It is possible that some potentially beneficial effects of 
      enrichment were precluded among group-housed mice, possibly owing to social 
      disturbances that might occur in these conditions. In fact, even if social 
      interaction is an essential feature of enrichment, it seems that some of the 
      positive effects of this housing condition might be optimal when mice are housed 
      individually, particularly with regard to buffering the effects of social defeat.

AB  - The present study was designed to systematically assess the control experience 
      routinely used in our laboratory as part of studies on predator odour stress. 
      Specifically, we examined effects of the physical and social components of this 
      control experience on measures of anxiety-like behaviour in adolescent rats. 
      Adolescent animals are at increased susceptibility to environmental perturbations 
      and have been used for such studies much less often. Long-Evans rats of both 
      sexes were subjected to physical stimulation (Exposed or Unexposed) and social 
      stimulation (Single-Housed or Pair-Housed), resulting in four groups. Exposed 
      rats received six 30-min exposures to an enclosed arena containing an unscented 
      piece of cat collar occurring between adolescence and early adulthood, while 
      Unexposed remained in the home cage. Groups of Exposed and Unexposed animals were 
      housed singly (Single-Housed) from early adolescence to early adulthood or 
      Pair-Housed during this time. Experimental procedures began in adolescence and 
      involved repeated assessment of startle amplitude (measure of anxiety-like 
      behaviour) and prepulse inhibition (PPI; a measure of sensorimotor gating) to 
      gauge the short-term impact of social and/or physical stimulation. All animals 
      were re-paired in adulthood prior to a final startle/PPI session to assess if 
      isolation limited to adolescence could impose long-term effects that were not 
      reversible. We also measured anxiety-like behaviour in adulthood using an 
      extended open field test (EOFT; addition of novel objects to the open field on 
      later days), and the elevated plus maze task (EPM), as well as a sucrose 
      preference test (SPT) to measure anhedonia. An absence of social or physical 
      stimulation resulted in increased startle amplitude and some measures of 
      anxiety-like behaviour in the EOFT, but a reduction in such anxiety-like 
      behaviour in the EPM task. These results suggest common neural substrates for the 
      physical and social experiences. Performance in the SPT was unaltered by any 
      experimental treatments. Sensorimotor gating, as measured by PPI, was increased 
      in the absence of physical stimulation with no short-term effect of isolation, or 
      of re-pairing. These results indicate the importance of considering individual 
      components of the rearing environment of rats, while showing the need to use 
      multiple assays of anxiety-like behaviour.

AB  - Exposure to stress and prolonged exposure to alcohol leads to neuronal damages in 
      several brain regions, being the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) one of the most 
      affected. These changes presumably reduce the ability of the organism to cope 
      with these stimuli and may underlie a series of maladaptive behaviours among 
      which include drug addiction and withdrawal. Drug-addicted individuals show a 
      pattern of behavior similar to patients with lesions of the mPFC. This impairment 
      in the decision-making could be one of the mechanisms responsible for the 
      transition from the casual to compulsive drug use. The environmental enrichment 
      (EE) has a protective effect on the neural and cognitive impairments induced by 
      psychoactive drugs, including ethyl alcohol. The present study aims to determine 
      the influence of withdrawal from intermittent long-term alcohol exposure on 
      alcohol preference, emotional reactivity and neural aspects of early isolated or 
      grouped reared rats kept under standard or complex environments and the influence 
      of social isolation on these measures, as well. Our results point out new 
      insights on this matter showing that the EE can attenuate the adverse effects of 
      withdrawal and social isolation on rat's behavior. This effect is probably due to 
      its protective action on the mPFC integrity, including the cingulate area 1 
      (Cg1), and the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic cortex (IL), what could account 
      for the absence of changes in the emotional reactivity in EE alcohol withdrawal 
      rats. We argue that morphological changes at these cortical levels can afford the 
      emotional, cognitive and behavioural dysregulations verified following withdrawal 
      from chronic alcohol intake.

AB  - AIMS: To clarify the role of the gut-brain axis in depression. MAIN METHODS: We 
      used the iTRAQ technique to identify differential proteins in the intestine of 
      the rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression. 
      Significant differential proteins were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) functional 
      annotations and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Key proteins were validated at 
      the mRNA and protein levels. The levels of cytokines in the intestine, serum and 
      hypothalamus were examined by ELISA. HPLC-UV was used to detect the levels of 
      amino acids. KEY FINDINGS: In the rat intestine, 349 differential proteins (209 
      downregulated, 140 upregulated) were identified. GO analysis indicated that 
      "protein complex assembly" was the first-ranked biological process. SNARE complex 
      components, including SNAP23, VAMP3 and VAMP8, were increased at the mRNA levels, 
      while only VAMP3 and VAMP8 were also upregulated at the protein level. TNFα, IL6 
      and IL1β were upregulated in the CUMS rat intestine, while TNFα was decreased in 
      the serum and hypothalamus. IL1β was decreased in the serum. "Protein digestion 
      and absorption" was the most significantly enriched KEGG pathway, involving 5 
      differential proteins: SLC9A3, ANPEP, LAT1, ASCT2 and B(0)AT1. Glutamine, glycine 
      and aspartic acid were perturbed in the CUMS rat intestine. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      findings suggest that CUMS enhances the adaptive immune response in the intestine 
      through ER-phagosome pathway mediated by SNARE complex and disturb absorption of 
      amino acids. It advances our understanding of the role of gut-brain axis in 
      depression and provides a potential therapeutic target for the disease.

TI  - Predicting how individuals approach enrichment: regulatory focus in cotton-top 
      tamarins (Sanguinus oedipus).
PG  - 427-35
LID - 10.1002/zoo.21075 [doi]
AB  - Evidence is mounting that personality is associated with health and well-being in 
      humans and other animals. In a step towards increasing our understanding of this 
      link, we applied regulatory focus theory, a motivational perspective from social 
      psychology, to the behavior of zoo-housed cotton top tamarins. We tested whether 
      regulatory focus "personality," that is stable differences in whether an 
      individual is motivated by gains versus safety, would 1) produce individual 
      differences in behavior and 2) predict how individuals interact with enrichment. 
      First, we characterized individuals with respect to several key behaviors: eating 
      in the open, hiding, and time spent near the front of the exhibit. The monkeys 
      were consistent in their behavioral tendencies across the 6-month study, allowing 
      regulatory focus classification. One monkey showed evidence of being a 
      promotion-individual, that is, more motivated by gains than safety. One monkey 
      showed evidence of being a prevention-individual, that is, more motivated by 
      safety than gains. The other monkeys were stable in their behavior and showed 
      evidence of being intermediate-individuals, that is, they favored neither gains 
      nor safety. Using these characterizations, we predicted distinct patterns of 
      individual-object interactions with enrichment. For example, we predicted that a 
      promotion-individual (favoring gains over safety) would approach potential gains 
      faster than a prevention-individual (favoring safety over gains). 
      Counter-intuitively, however, we also predicted that a promotion-individual would 
      approach non-gains slower than a prevention-individual concerned with safety. We 
      found support for our predictions, which suggests that regulatory focus theory 
      could be a useful tool for understanding how and why individuals interact with 
      environmental enrichment.

TI  - Transcriptomics in Interferon-α-Treated Patients Identifies Inflammation-, 
      Neuroplasticity- and Oxidative Stress-Related Signatures as Predictors and 
      Correlates of Depression.
PG  - 2502-11
LID - 10.1038/npp.2016.50 [doi]
AB  - Owing to the unique opportunity to assess individuals before and after they 
      develop depression within a short timeframe, interferon-α (IFN-α) treatment for 
      chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an ideal model to identify molecular 
      mechanisms relevant to major depression, especially in the context of enhanced 
      inflammation. Fifty-eight patients were assessed prospectively, at baseline and 
      monthly over 24 weeks of IFN-α treatment. New-onset cases of depression were 
      determined using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). 
      Whole-blood transcriptomic analyses were conducted to investigate the following: 
      (1) baseline gene expression differences associated with future development of 
      IFN-α-induced depression, before IFN-α, and (2) longitudinal gene expression 
      changes from baseline to weeks 4 or 24 of IFN-α treatment, separately in those 
      who did and did not develop depression. Transcriptomics data were analyzed using 
      Partek Genomics Suite (1.4-fold, FDR adjusted p⩽0.05) and Ingenuity Pathway 
      Analysis Software. Twenty patients (34%) developed IFN-α-induced depression. At 
      baseline, 73 genes were differentially expressed in patients who later developed 
      depression compared with those who did not. After 4 weeks of IFN-α treatment, 592 
      genes were modulated in the whole sample, representing primarily IFN-α-responsive 
      genes. Substantially more genes were modulated only in patients who developed 
      depression (n=506, compared with n=70 in patients who did not), with enrichment 
      in inflammation-, neuroplasticity- and oxidative stress-related pathways. A 
      similar picture was observed at week 24. Our data indicate that patients who 
      develop IFN-α-induced depression have an increased biological sensitivity to 
      IFN-α, as shown by larger gene expression changes, and specific signatures both 
      as predictors and as correlates.

TI  - Egg enrichment with n-3 fatty acids in farmed hens in sub-optimum temperature: A 
      cold-temperament additive mix alleviates adverse effects of stress on performance 
      and health.
PG  - 1333-1344
LID - 10.1111/jpn.13659 [doi]
AB  - At some stage, laying hen farming is likely to be subjected to sub-optimum 
      temperatures (SOTem) due to climate change. While egg enrichment with n-3 fatty 
      acids is a common practice in the poultry industry, in SOTem it has been less 
      investigated. This study tested the effects of egg enrichment through extruded 
      flaxseed (FLX) (180 g/kg) alone or along with hulled-soaked barley (H-SB) 
      (170 g/kg), namely FLBA, with and without a cold-temperament additive mix (CTA) 
      (25 g/kg: 5 g/kg flixweed (Descurainia sophia), 10 g/kg dried herb-extraction 
      residues from pussy willow (Salix aegyptiaca) and 10 g/kg dried lemon (Citrus 
      limon) residue) in two temperatures (20°C and SOTem: 27°C) on egg performance, 
      yolk fatty acids, lipid components, blood biochemistry, serological enzymes, 
      antioxidant and immune system of Hy-Line W-36 53-week-old for 9 weeks. Two 
      hundred seventy layers were randomly distributed to nine treatments, resulting in 
      six replicates with five hens. Hens fed flaxseed diets, regardless of temperature 
      or CTA, had higher levels of n-3 fatty acids in yolks than others. Temperature 
      negatively influenced feed intake and egg production. FLX + H27 and FLBA + H27 
      groups outperformed the other groups regarding cholesterol in yolk (10.1, 
      10.3 mg/g yolk), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (5.19, 4.93 mg/g yolk), total 
      protein (FLX + H27: 6.82 mg/dl), HDL in the blood (FLBA + H27:83.8 mg/dl), 
      superoxide dismutase (FLBA + H27:90.4 U/ml), glutathione reductase (FLBA + H27: 
      1042.1 U/ml), glutathione peroxidase (FLX + H27: 1149.7 U/ml) and catalase 
      (FLBA + H27: 12.5 U/ml). Total antibody, immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M 
      after 42 days were significantly higher in chicks fed CTA-added diets (p < 0.05). 
      Replacing corn and soya bean meal with H-SB did not negatively change the 
      above-mentioned factors. Our findings collectively suggest that egg enrichment 
      with n-3 fatty acids through dietary FLBA + H27 (180 g/kg flaxseed, 170 g/kg 
      H-SB, and 25 g/kg CTA) in SOtem is suggested without any adverse impacts.

TI  - Long Term Physiologic and Behavioural Effects of Housing Density and 
      Environmental Resource Provision for Adult Male and Female Sprague Dawley Rats.
LID - 10.3390/ani7060044 [doi]

AB  - There is considerable interest in refining laboratory rodent environments to 
      promote animal well-being, as well as research reproducibility. Few studies have 
      evaluated the long term impact of enhancing rodent environments with resources 
      and additional cagemates. To that end, male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats 
      were housed singly (n = 8/sex), in pairs (n = 16/sex), or in groups of four (n = 
      16/sex) for five months. Single and paired rats were housed in standard cages 
      with a nylon chew toy, while group-housed rats were kept in double-wide cages 
      with two PVC shelters and a nylon chew toy and were provided with food enrichment 
      three times weekly. Animal behaviour, tests of anxiety (open field, elevated plus 
      maze, and thermal nociception), and aspects of animal physiology (fecal corticoid 
      levels, body weight, weekly food consumption, organ weights, and cerebral stress 
      signaling peptide and receptor mRNA levels) were measured. Significant 
      differences were noted, primarily in behavioural data, with sustained positive 
      social interactions and engagement with environmental resources noted throughout 
      the study. These results suggest that modest enhancements in the environment of 
      both male and female SD rats may be beneficial to their well-being, while 
      introducing minimal variation in other aspects of behavioural or physiologic 
      responses.

TI  - Keeping brains young with making music.
PG  - 297-305
LID - 10.1007/s00429-017-1491-2 [doi]
AB  - Music-making is a widespread leisure and professional activity that has garnered 
      interest over the years due to its effect on brain and cognitive development and 
      its potential as a rehabilitative and restorative therapy of brain dysfunctions. 
      We investigated whether music-making has a potential age-protecting effect on the 
      brain. For this, we studied anatomical magnetic resonance images obtained from 
      three matched groups of subjects who differed in their lifetime dose of 
      music-making activities (i.e., professional musicians, amateur musicians, and 
      non-musicians). For each subject, we calculated a so-called BrainAGE score which 
      corresponds to the discrepancy (in years) between chronological age and the "age 
      of the brain", with negative values reflecting an age-decelerating brain and 
      positive values an age-accelerating brain, respectively. The index of "brain age" 
      was estimated using a machine-learning algorithm that was trained in a large 
      independent sample to identify anatomical correlates of brain-aging. Compared to 
      non-musicians, musicians overall had lower BrainAGE scores, with amateur 
      musicians having the lowest scores suggesting that music-making has an 
      age-decelerating effect on the brain. Unlike the amateur musicians, the 
      professional musicians showed a positive correlation between their BrainAGE 
      scores and years of music-making, possibly indicating that engaging more 
      intensely in just one otherwise enriching activity might not be as beneficial 
      than if the activity is one of several that an amateur musician engages in. 
      Intense music-making activities at a professional level could also lead to 
      stress-related interferences and a less enriched environment than that of amateur 
      musicians, possibly somewhat diminishing the otherwise positive effect of 
      music-making.

TI  - Behavioral differences among domestic cats in the response to cat-attracting 
      plants and their volatile compounds reveal a potential distinct mechanism of 
      action for actinidine.
PG  - 192
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01369-1 [doi]
LID - 192
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been known for centuries that cats respond euphorically to 
      Nepeta cataria (catnip). Recently, we have shown that Lonicera tatarica (Tatarian 
      honeysuckle), Actinidia polygama (silver vine), and Valeriana officinalis 
      (valerian) can also elicit this "catnip response". The aim of this study was to 
      learn if the behavior seen in response to these plants is similar to the response 
      to catnip. Furthermore, we studied if these responses are fixed or if there are 
      differences between cats. While nepetalactone was identified decades ago as the 
      molecule responsible for the "catnip response", we know that this volatile is 
      found almost exclusively in catnip. Therefore, we also aimed to identify other 
      compounds in these alternative plants that can elicit the blissful behavior in 
      cats. Bioassays with 6 cats were performed in a low-stress environment, where 5 
      plants and 13 single compounds were each tested for at least 100 and 17 h, 
      respectively. All responses were video recorded and BORIS software was used to 
      analyze the cats' behavior. RESULTS: Both response duration and behavior differed 
      significantly between the cats. While individual cats had preferences for 
      particular plants, the behavior of individual cats was consistent among all 
      plants. About half a dozen lactones similar in structure to nepetalactone were 
      able to elicit the "catnip response", as were the structurally more distinct 
      molecules actinidine and dihydroactinidiolide. Most cats did not respond to 
      actinidine, whereas those who did, responded longer to this volatile than any of 
      the other secondary plant metabolites, and different behavior was observed. 
      Interestingly, dihydroactinidiolide was also found in excretions and secretions 
      of the red fox, making this the first report of a compound produced by a mammal 
      that can elicit the "catnip response". A range of different cat-attracting 
      compounds was detected by chemical analysis of plant materials but differences in 
      cat behavior could not be directly related to differences in chemical composition 
      of the plants. Together with results of, among others, habituation / 
      dishabituation experiments, this indicates that additional cat-attracting 
      compounds may be present in the plant materials that remain to be discovered. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that both the personality of 
      the cat and genetic variation in the genes encoding olfactory receptors may play 
      a role in how cats respond to cat-attracting plants. Furthermore, the data 
      suggest a potential distinct mechanism of action for actinidine.

TI  - Anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects of environmental enrichment seem to be

      raphe.

AB  - In a previous study, we showed that exposure of rats to a one-week environmental 
      enrichment (EE) protocol decreases elevated T-maze (ETM) avoidance responses, an 
      anxiolytic-like effect, without altering escape reactions, in clinical terms 
      related to panic disorder. These anxiolytic-like effects were followed by 
      decreased delta FosB-immunoreactivity (delta FosB-ir) in the cingulate cortex, 
      dorsolateral and intermediate lateral septum, hippocampus (cornus of Ammon), 
      anterior and dorsomedial hypothalamus, medial and basolateral amygdala and 
      ventral region of the dorsal raphe nucleus. The purpose of the present study was 
      to further investigate behavioral and neurophysiological alterations induced by 
      EE exposure. For that, in a first experiment we verified if increasing the time 
      of exposure to the same EE protocol used in our previous study (from one to two 
      weeks) altered male Wistar rats' ETM escape responses. All animals were tested in 
      an open field, immediately after the ETM, for locomotor activity assessment. 
      Since anxiety and panic-related reactions have been associated to the functioning 
      of specific subnuclei of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), we also evaluated delta 
      FosB-ir in serotonergic cells of DR regions. At last, we analyzed plasma 
      corticosterone levels in animals submitted to EE and to standard housing. Results 
      showed that a two-week exposure to EE decreases both ETM avoidance and escape 
      reactions, inducing anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects, respectively. There 
      was also a significant decrease in the number of double staining neurons in the 
      midrostral region of the dorsal subnucleus of the dorsal raphe. No changes in 
      corticosterone levels, however, were observed. These results contribute to a 
      better understanding of the effects of EE on anxiety and panic-related responses.

TI  - Environmental enrichment upregulates micro-RNA-183 and alters 
      acetylcholinesterase splice variants to reduce anxiety-like behavior in the 
      little Indian field mouse (Mus booduga).
PG  - 426-35
LID - 10.1002/jnr.23165 [doi]
AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) has an influential role in reducing behavioral 
      reactivity to stress. We previously observed that EE reduces the anxiety-like 
      behavior in the field mouse Mus booduga accompanied by a reduction in the 
      expression of molecules involved in the stress pathway. In this study, we 
      demonstrate the effect of different housing condition on regulation of 
      micro-RNA-183-SC35-mediated splicing of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adult male 
      M. booduga were captured from an agricultural field and housed under nonenriched 
      standard conditions (SC) for 7 days and considered as directly from the wild 
      (DW). On day 8, individuals were randomly assigned to three groups; DW, SC, and 
      EE. The DW group's anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated plus maze 
      (EPM) and open field test (OFT). The SC and EE groups were transferred to their 
      respective conditions and housed for another 30 days. The mice housed in EE 
      showed less anxiety-like behavior on EPM and in OFT compared with DW and SC mice. 
      Interestingly, miR-183 expression was increased following exposure to EPM in EE 
      mice but not in SC mice. Subsequently, the upregulated miR-183 expression 
      suppresses the SC35 expression and shifting of splicing from AChE-S (synaptic) to 
      AChE-R (read-through) form, whereas standard housing condition downregulate 
      miR-183 and induces the splicing of AChE. The upregulated AChE-R form possibly 
      terminates ACh transmission, which is reflected in the level of anxiety-like 
      behavior. Overall, the present study suggests that EE effectively regulates the 
      miR-183 pathway to reduce anxiety-like behavior.

TI  - Early social enrichment provided by communal nest increases resilience to 
      depression-like behavior more in female than in male mice.
PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2010.06.030 [doi]
AB  - Early experiences produce persistent changes in behavior and brain function. 
      Being reared in a communal nest (CN), consisting of a single nest where three 
      mouse mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior from birth 
      to weaning, provides an highly stimulating social environment to the developing 
      pup since both mother-offspring and peer-to-peer interactions are markedly 
      increased. Here we show that being reared in a CN affects adult behavior of CD-1 
      mice in a gender-dependent fashion, with reduced depression-like responses in 
      females and increased anxiety-like behavior in males. In particular, CN females 
      showed higher sucrose preference at baseline condition, drinking more sweet 
      solution compared to female mice reared in a standard laboratory condition (SN). 
      In the isolation test, both SN and CN females showed a reduction in sucrose 
      preference after exposure to isolation stress. However, after 24h, only CN 
      females significantly recovered. Finally, in the forced swim test, compared to 
      SN, CN females spent longer time floating, a behavioral response that in the CN 
      model has been inversely associated with display of endophenotypes of depression. 
      With regard to the emotional response, CN males displayed an increased 
      anxiety-like behavior in comparison to SN, spending less time in the open arms 
      and displaying reduced head-dippings in the elevated plus-maze test. No 
      difference was found in females. Overall, our findings show that gender and early 
      experiences interact in modulating adult behavior. In particular, we show that 
      early experiences modified developmental trajectories shaping adult 
      endophenotypes of depression more markedly in females than in males.

TI  - A resource perspective on the work-home interface: the work-home resources model.
PG  - 545-56
LID - 10.1037/a0027974 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this article is to provide a theoretical framework explaining 
      positive and negative work-home processes integrally. Using insights from 
      conservation of resources theory, we explain how personal resources (e.g., time, 
      energy, and mood) link demanding and resourceful aspects of one domain to 
      outcomes in the other domain. The resulting work-home resources (W-HR) model 
      describes work-home conflict as a process whereby demands in one domain deplete 
      personal resources and impede accomplishments in the other domain. Enrichment is 
      described as a process of resource accumulation: Work and home resources increase 
      personal resources. Those personal resources, in turn, can be utilized to improve 
      home and work outcomes. Moreover, our resource approach to the work-home 
      interface allows us to address two other issues that have thus far lacked a solid 
      theoretical foundation. The W-HR model also explains how conditional factors such 
      as personality and culture may influence the occurrence of work-home conflict and 
      enrichment. Furthermore, the model allows us to examine how work-home conflict 
      and enrichment develop over time. Finally, the model provides useful insights for 
      other psychology subdisciplines, such as gender studies and developmental 
      psychology.

TI  - Relationship Between Chronic Stress and Heart Rate Over Time Modulated by Gender 
      in a Cohort of Office Workers: Cross-Sectional Study Using Wearable Technologies.
PG  - e18253
LID - 10.2196/18253 [doi]
LID - e18253
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is increasing in prevalence and is associated with 
      several physical and mental disorders. Although it is proven that acute stress 
      changes physiology, much less is known about the relationship between physiology 
      and long-term stress. Continuous measurement of vital signs in daily life and 
      chronic stress detection algorithms could serve this purpose. For this, it is 
      paramount to model the effects of chronic stress on human physiology and include 
      other cofounders, such as demographics, enabling the enrichment of a 
      population-wide approach with individual variations. OBJECTIVE: The main 
      objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of chronic stress on 
      heart rate (HR) over time while correcting for weekdays versus weekends and to 
      test a possible modulation effect by gender and age in a healthy cohort. METHODS: 
      Throughout 2016 and 2017, healthy employees of technology companies were asked to 
      participate in a 5-day observation stress study. They were required to wear two 
      wearables, of which one included an electrocardiogram sensor. The derived HR was 
      averaged per hour and served as an output for a mixed design model including a 
      trigonometric fit over time with four harmonics (periods of 24, 12, 8, and 6 
      hours), gender, age, whether it was a workday or weekend day, and a chronic 
      stress score derived from the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) as predictors. 
      RESULTS: The study included 328 subjects, of which 142 were female and 186 were 
      male participants, with a mean age of 38.9 (SD 10.2) years and a mean PSS score 
      of 13.7 (SD 6.0). As main effects, gender (χ(2)(1)=24.02, P<.001); the hour of 
      the day (χ(2)(1)=73.22, P<.001); the circadian harmonic (χ(2)(2)=284.4, P<.001); 
      and the harmonic over 12 hours (χ(2)(2)=242.1, P<.001), over 8 hours 
      (χ(2)(2)=23.78, P<.001), and over 6 hours (χ(2)(2)=82.96, P<.001) had a 
      significant effect on HR. Two three-way interaction effects were found. The 
      interaction of age, whether it was a workday or weekend day, and the circadian 
      harmonic over time were significantly correlated with HR (χ(2)(2)=7.13, P=.03), 
      as well as the interaction of gender, PSS score, and the circadian harmonic over 
      time (χ(2)(2)=7.59, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: The results show a relationship between 
      HR and the three-way interaction of chronic stress, gender, and the circadian 
      harmonic. The modulation by gender might be related to evolution-based energy 
      utilization strategies, as suggested in related literature studies. More 
      research, including daily cortisol assessment, longer recordings, and a wider 
      population, should be performed to confirm this interpretation. This would enable 
      the development of more complete and personalized models of chronic stress.

TI  - Responding for a conditioned reinforcer or unconditioned sensory reinforcer in 
      mice: interactions with environmental enrichment, social isolation, and monoamine 
      reuptake inhibitors.
PG  - 983-93
LID - 10.1007/s00213-015-4178-5 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Environmental factors influence the etiology of many psychiatric 
      disorders. Likewise, environmental factors can alter processes central to 
      motivation. Therefore, motivational deficits present in many disorders may be 
      influenced by early life environmental conditions. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether 
      housing animals in different environmental conditions influenced the ability of 
      sensory stimuli to acquire incentive value and whether elevated monoamine 
      activity altered responsing for these stimuli. METHODS: Isolation-housed (IH), 
      pair-housed (PH), and environmentally enriched (EE) male C57BL/6N mice were 
      examined in tests of responding for a conditioned reinforcer (CRf) or an 
      unconditioned sensory reinforcer (USRf). The CRf was previously paired with 
      saccharin delivery through Pavlovian conditioning, while the USRf was not 
      conditioned with a reward. Following baseline tests of responding for the CRf or 
      USRf, the effects of elevated monoamine activity were examined. RESULTS: At 
      baseline, PH and EE mice responded similarly for the CRf or USRf. IH mice 
      responded more for the CRf but exhibited slower acquisition of responding for the 
      USRf. Administration of citalopram, a serotonin transporter blocker, or 
      atomoxetine, a norepinephrine transporter blocker, decreased responding for the 
      CRf and USRf in all groups. The dopamine transporter blocker GBR 12909 generally 
      increased responding for the CRf and USRf, but further analysis revealed enhanced 
      responding for both reinforcers only in EE mice. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline incentive 
      motivation is strongly influenced by the social component of housing conditions. 
      Furthermore, environmental enrichment increased the sensitivity to elevated 
      dopamine activity, while acute elevations in serotonin and norepinephrine inhibit 
      incentive motivation irrespective of housing condition.

TI  - A laboratory exercise for a college-level, introductory neuroscience course 
      demonstrating effects of housing environment on anxiety and psychostimulant 
      sensitivity.
PG  - A26-32
AB  - In this paper we describe a lab exercise developed for the Introduction to 
      Neuroscience course at Williams College. One of a series of five labs, this 
      exercise demonstrated several key principles of behavioral neuroscience. In this 
      lab, students explored the effects of post-weaning housing environment on 
      anxiety-like behavior and psychostimulant sensitivity in rodents. The exercise 
      was intended to emphasize the importance and utility of animal models in 
      neuroscience research and to give students hands-on experience with behavioral 
      neuroscience research techniques. Students tested rats reared in social isolation 
      or environmental enrichment for anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus maze, 
      and for spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity in the open field. 
      They were then asked to analyze pooled class data and prepare a short lab report. 
      Overall, student performance was excellent. This exercise emerged as a class 
      favorite on course evaluations. Interestingly, the first time this exercise was 
      conducted, the effects of environmental enrichment on anxiety-like behaviors and 
      psychostimulant sensitivity were not consistent with those published in previous 
      studies. Key methodological issues that may account for this discrepancy and 
      contribute to successful implementation by other programs are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early life social adversity can influence stress response mechanisms 
      and is associated with anxious behaviour and reductions in callosal area later in 
      life. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between perceptions of parental 
      bonding in childhood/adolescence, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      response, and callosal structural integrity in adult victims of severe urban 
      violence with and without PTSD. METHODS: Seventy-one individuals with PTSD and 62 
      without the disorder were assessed with the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). 
      The prednisolone suppression test was administered to assess cortisol levels, and 
      magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the total area of the corpus 
      callosum (CC), as well as the areas of callosal subregions. RESULTS: The PBI 
      items related to the perception of 'not having a controlling mother' (OR 4.84; 
      95%CI [2.26-10.3]; p=0.01), 'having a caring father' (OR 2.46; 95'%CI 
      [1.18-5.12]; p=0.02), and 'not having controlling parents' (OR 2.70; 95%CI 
      [1.10-6.63]; p=0.04) were associated with a lower risk of PTSD. The PTSD group 
      showed a blunted response to the prednisolone suppression test, with lower 
      salivary cortisol levels upon waking up (p=0.03). Individuals with PTSD had 
      smaller total CC area than those without the disorder, but these differences were 
      not statistically significant (e-value =0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy parental 
      bonding, characterized by the perception of low parental control and high 
      affection, were associated with a lower risk of PTSD in adulthood, suggesting 
      that emotional enrichment and the encouragement of autonomy are protective 
      against PTSD in adulthood.

AB  - Decreased interest in pleasurable stimuli including social withdrawal and reduced 
      libido are some of the key symptomatic criteria for major depression, and thus 
      assays that measure social and sexual behavior in rodents may be highly 
      appropriate for modeling depressive states. Here we present a novel approach for 
      validating rodent models of depression by assessing male urine scent marking 
      (USM) made in consequence to a spot of urine from a proestrous female. USM is an 
      ethologically important form of sexual communication expressed by males to 
      attract females. The expression of this behavior is highly sensitive and adaptive 
      to environmental cues and social status. We hypothesized that male USM behavior 
      offers a naturalistic measure of social motivation that can be used to evaluate 
      hedonic behaviors relevant to the study of mood disorders. We demonstrated that 
      1) adult male mice displayed a strong preference for marking proestrous female 
      urine with a high degree of specificity, 2) exposure to chronic social defeat 
      profoundly decreased USM whereas exposure to environmental enrichment increased 
      USM, 3) the standard antidepressant fluoxetine reversed declines in USM induced 
      by social defeat, 4) USM behavior closely correlated with other hedonic measures, 
      and 5) USM scores in non-stressed mice predicted behavioral outcomes after defeat 
      exposure such that mice displaying high preference for marking female urine prior 
      to social defeat showed behavioral resiliency after social defeat. The findings 
      indicate that the USM test is a sensitive, validated measure of psychosocial 
      stress effects that has high predictive value for examination of stress 
      resiliency and vulnerability and their neurobiological substrates.

TI  - Differential effect of environment enrichment and social isolation on 
      depressive-like behavior, spontaneous activity and serotonin and norepinephrine 
      concentration in prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum.
PG  - 85-93
AB  - In order to determine the effect of postnatal environments on some behavioral and 
      neurochemical depressive-like parameters, male Sprague-Dawley rats were reared 
      from weaning in either social isolation, standard laboratory conditions, or 
      environmental enrichment. Open-field activity was assessed at postnatal days 37, 
      65, 93 and 107 and 1 h before the last open-field test, a forced-swimming test 
      was carried out. After behavioral tests, the monoamines concentrations were 
      analyzed in prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Relative to control and 
      isolation rearing, the environmental enrichment reduced open-field activity, led 
      to antidepressive-like effects and increased serotonin concentrations in the 
      prefrontal cortex. Social isolation, on the other hand, did not affect open-field 
      activity, but increased depressive-like behavior and reduced the amount of 
      norepinephrine in the ventral striatum. Those neurochemical changes induced by 
      rearing conditions correlated with the behavioral performance in the 
      forced-swimming test. Also, immobility behavior could be predicted by locomotor 
      activity even from the first week of housing. Overall, specific variations in 
      physical and social environment during early rearing lead to some behavioral and 
      neurochemical alterations which might be relevant for understanding the role that 
      neurodevelopmental and experiential factors could have in human depression.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental model which is believed to 
      counteract some of the effects induced by stressors, although few studies have 
      exposed rodents simultaneously to EE and stress. Our aim was to compare the 
      short- and long-term effects of different housing conditions in mice submitted to 
      chronic stress. 128 NMRI male mice arrived at our laboratory on postnatal day 
      (PND) 21. During Phase I (PND 28), animals were randomly assigned to four 
      experimental conditions: 1) EE+STRESS: mice housed in EE and submitted to social 
      stress (n=32); 2) EE+NO STRESS: mice housed in EE without stress (n=32); 3) 
      SE+STRESS: mice maintained in standard conditions (SE) and submitted to social 
      stress (n=32); and 4) SE+NO STRESS (n=32). At the end of Phase I (PND 77), one 
      cohort of 32 animals was used for behavioral assessment whereas another cohort of 
      32 was sacrificed for corticosterone analysis. Results indicated that EE animals 
      showed less body weight, higher water and food intake, diminished anxiety 
      response and decreased motor and exploratory behavior than SE mice. Mice exposed 
      to stress gained less body weight, showed higher food and fluid intake and 
      displayed decreased exploratory behavior than non-stressed mice. Furthermore, 
      EE+STRESS group displayed significantly higher corticosterone levels than EE+NO 
      STRESS group whereas EE+NO STRESS group showed lower levels than SE+NO STRESS. On 
      PND 83, Phase II of the study began. Animals (n=96) were assigned to two 
      different housing conditions: EE (n=48) and SE (n=48). On PND 112, corticosterone 
      analysis (n=32) and behavioral study (n=64) were done. The factor "Housing Phase 
      II" reached statistical significance. Results indicated that EE animals showed 
      lower body weight and higher fluid intake than SE group, as well as decreased 
      anxiety. No clear effects on motor and exploratory behavior or learning were 
      observed. When long-term effects were analyzed, results indicated that "Initial 
      Housing" condition was significant: animals allocated in EE during Phase I of the 
      study showed higher corticosterone levels, lower body weight and higher fluid 
      intake than SE mice. "Initial Stress" had significant long-term actions on food 
      intake and exploratory behavior: animals initially reared under stress conditions 
      displayed higher food intake and lower exploration levels on the hole-board test 
      than non-stressed mice. In the elevated plus-maze, there were significant 
      interactions between factors "Initial Housing" and "Initial Stress". These 
      factors did not reach statistical significance for motor activity or learning 
      task. We can conclude that both short- and long-term effects of housing 
      conditions are evident for corticosterone levels, body weight and fluid intake. 
      Social stress induced short-term effects on body weight, food and fluid intake 
      and exploratory behavior whereas long-acting effects were reflected on food 
      intake and exploratory behavior. Further studies are needed in order to explore 
      more in depth behavioral and physiological consequences of social stress and 
      environmental enrichment.

AB  - Our previous work has shown that male Sprague-Dawley rats reared in social 
      isolation, standard housing and environmental enrichment differ in their 
      spontaneous open-field activity and in some neurobehavioral depressive-like 
      parameters. Here, we extended this evidence by using a shorter postweaning 
      rearing period (1 month) and including additional evaluations. First, in order to 
      obtain a better characterization of the exploratory strategies among rearing 
      conditions we analyzed in detail the spontaneous activity at the first minute and 
      during the 10-min session. Second, we asked whether the changes in open-field 
      activity were related with basal anxiety levels in the elevated plus-maze. Third, 
      behavior in the forced-swimming test was analyzed and afterward, the tissue 
      levels of hippocampal norepinephrine and serotonin were assessed. The possible 
      relationship between neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behavior were explored 
      through correlation analyses. We found that rearing conditions (i) differed on 
      locomotor habituation and on sensory-motor exploration at the first minute and 
      during the 10-min session without modifying the plus-maze behavior; (ii) affected 
      differentially the grooming time, its sequential components, and the relationship 
      between grooming and locomotor parameters; (iii) modified forced-swimming 
      behavior and the hippocampal concentration of norepinephrine, serotonin, and its 
      turnover; and (iv) produced different correlation patterns between both 
      neurotransmitters and forced-swimming behaviors. Overall, environmental 
      enrichment accelerated open-field habituation and led to behavioral and 
      neurochemical antidepressant-like effects. In contract, isolation rearing 
      strongly impaired habituation and simple information processing, but showed 
      marginal effects on depressive-like behavior and on hippocampal neurochemistry. 
      The current results suggest that differential rearing is not only a useful 
      procedure to study behavioral plasticity or rigidity in response to early 
      experience, but also to modeling some developmental protective or risk factors 
      underlying depressive disorders.

AB  - Methods for understanding the neurocircuitry of ethologically relevant behaviors 
      have advanced substantially; however renovations to standard animal laboratory 
      housing, in the form of enhanced enrichment, have lagged behind. This is despite 
      evidence that environmental enrichment (EE) reduces stress, stereotypy, and 
      promotes healthy species typical behaviors. While many scientists express 
      interest for increased EE as a standard for animal caging systems, there are 
      concerns that its effects on brain, behavior, and cognition are not well 
      characterized. In the present study, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      housed for six weeks in either EE, Colony Nesting (CN), or Standard Housing (SD) 
      conditions. We show that adolescent exposure to environmental complexity changed 
      the dynamics of social interactions, sensory processing, and underlying basal 
      stress neurocircuitry, in a sex- and enrichment-type-dependent manner. 
      Specifically, EE and CN increased prosocial engagement and the social saliency of 
      male and female rats while the profile of hippocampal Crhr2 expression was 
      affected only in EE males. Hippocampal Crh was associated with anxiety-like 
      behavior in SD males - this did not extend to EE or CN groups, nor to females. 
      Observations such as these are an important consideration for the validity of 
      translational research investigating the neurocircuitry of stress resiliency, and 
      for understanding the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. Future work must focus 
      on characterizing how individual environmental enhancements (e.g. novelty, social 
      enrichment, physical activity) shape phenotypic differences, how they vary as a 
      function of species, strain and sex, and (if warranted) how to meaningfully 
      implement this knowledge into biomedical research designs.

AB  - Environmental stress is among the most important contributors to increased 
      susceptibility to develop psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and 
      post-traumatic stress disorder. While even acute stress alters gene expression, 
      the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. 
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a novel environmentally sensitive DNA 
      modification that is highly enriched in post-mitotic neurons and is associated 
      with active transcription of neuronal genes. Recently, we found a hippocampal 
      increase of 5hmC in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (Nr3c1) following acute 
      stress, warranting a deeper investigation of stress-related 5hmC levels. Here we 
      used an established chemical labeling and affinity purification method coupled 
      with high-throughput sequencing technology to generate the first genome-wide 
      profile of hippocampal 5hmC following exposure to acute restraint stress and a 
      one-hour recovery. This approach found a genome-wide disruption in 5hmC 
      associated with acute stress response, primarily in genic regions, and identified 
      known and potentially novel stress-related targets that have a significant 
      enrichment for neuronal ontological functions. Integration of these data with 
      hippocampal gene expression data from these same mice found stress-related 
      hydroxymethylation correlated to altered transcript levels and sequence motif 
      predictions indicated that 5hmC may function by mediating transcription factor 
      binding to these transcripts. Together, these data reveal an environmental impact 
      on this newly discovered epigenetic mark in the brain and represent a critical 
      step toward understanding stress-related epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene 
      expression and can lead to the development of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - RATIONALE: Early life adversity impacts reward-related behaviors, including 
      reward seeking for drugs of abuse. However, the effects of early stress on 
      natural rewards, such as food and social rewards, which have strong implications 
      for symptoms of psychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD), 
      are understudied. To fill this gap, we used the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) 
      procedure to assess the impact of early resource scarcity on motivational drive 
      for both food and social rewards in rats. METHODS: Male and female Long Evans 
      rats were reared in either an LBN environment, with limited nesting materials and 
      no enrichment, from their postnatal day 2-9 or control environment with ample 
      nesting materials and enrichment. As adults, they were tested for reward-seeking 
      behavior on progressive ratio operant tasks: food reward (sucrose) or social 
      reward (access to a same-sex/age conspecific). RESULTS: We observed sex 
      differences in the impact of LBN on motivation for natural rewards. In males, LBN 
      increased motivation for both a sucrose and social reward. In females, LBN 
      reduced motivation for sucrose but had no effect on social reward. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results suggest that the effects of LBN on motivation for natural rewards 
      are both sex- and reinforcer-dependent, with males and females showing 
      differential motivation for food and social rewards following early scarcity. Our 
      previous data revealed an LBN-driven reduction in motivation for morphine in 
      males and no effect in females, highlighting the reinforcer-dependent impact of 
      early resource scarcity on motivated behavior more widely.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Kennel facilities are commonly acknowledged as a stressful 
      environment for many domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). One therapeutic measure 
      used to reduce anxiety in dogs is dog appeasing pheromone (DAP), which has been 
      found effective in reducing stress-related behaviours in a number of contexts. 
      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: A pilot study was conducted to assess whether DAP would 
      reduce frequency of stress-related behaviours in a group of eight dogs housed for 
      teaching purposes in a long-term kennelling facility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Using video analysis, proportion of time spent in stress-related behaviours for 
      six dogs fitted with DAP collars, versus two control dogs (without collars), was 
      compared for the time before and during DAP exposure. RESULTS: No significant 
      differences were found either in the proportion of time spent in stress-related 
      behaviours in the baseline versus treatment periods or between the collared and 
      control dogs in the change in proportion of time they spent in any of the focal 
      behaviours in the baseline versus treatment periods. CONCLUSIONS: Possible 
      reasons for these findings include an actual lack of effect of DAP on dogs housed 
      in this long-term kennelling facility, an apparent lack of effect due to small 
      sample size in this pilot study and high behavioural variation among individual 
      dogs. Despite lack of a demonstrated effect of the DAP collars on these dogs, 
      attention brought by this study to the behavioural issues seen in some of the 
      dogs did have a positive impact, as it contributed to the development of an 
      active, coordinated behavioural wellness and enrichment programme for the colony.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are "master post-transcriptional regulators" of 
      gene expression. Here we investigate miRNAs involved in the incentive motivation 
      for cocaine elicited by exposure to cocaine-associated cues. METHODS: We 
      conducted NanoString nCounter analyses of microRNA expression in the nucleus 
      accumbens shell of male rats that had been tested for cue reactivity in a 
      previous study. These rats had been trained to self-administer cocaine while 
      living in isolate housing, then during a subsequent 21-day forced abstinence 
      period they either stayed under isolate housing or switched to environmental 
      enrichment (EE), as this EE intervention is known to decrease cocaine seeking. 
      This allowed us to create groups of "high" and "low" cocaine seekers using a 
      median split of cocaine-seeking behavior. RESULTS: Differential expression 
      analysis across high- and low-seekers identified 33 microRNAs that were 
      differentially expressed in the nucleus accumbens shell. Predicted mRNA targets 
      of these microRNAs are implicated in synaptic plasticity, neuronal signaling, and 
      neuroinflammation signaling, and many are known addiction-related genes. Of the 
      33 differentially-expressed microRNAs, 8 were specifically downregulated in the 
      low-seeking group and another set of 8 had expression levels that were 
      significantly correlated with cocaine-seeking behavior. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings not only confirm the involvement of previously identified microRNAs 
      (e.g., miR-212, miR-495) but also reveal novel microRNAs (e.g., miR-3557, 
      miR-377) that alter, or are altered by, processes associated with cocaine-seeking 
      behavior. Further research examining the mechanisms involved in these microRNA 
      changes and their effects on signaling may reveal novel therapeutic targets for 
      attenuating drug craving.

TI  - A translational rodent assay of affective biases in depression and antidepressant 
      therapy.
PG  - 1625-35
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.69 [doi]
AB  - The subjective measures used to study mood disorders in humans cannot be 
      replicated in animals; however, the increasing application of objective 
      neuropsychological methods provides opportunities to develop translational animal 
      tasks. Here we describe a novel behavioral approach, which has enabled us to 
      investigate similar affective biases in rodents. In our affective bias test 
      (ABT), rats encounter two independent positive experiences--the association 
      between food reward and specific digging substrate--during discrimination 
      learning sessions. These are performed on separate days under either neutral 
      conditions or during a pharmacological or affective state manipulation. Affective 
      bias is then quantified using a preference test where both previously rewarded 
      substrates are presented together and the rat's choices recorded. The absolute 
      value of the experience is kept consistent and all other factors are 
      counterbalanced so that any bias at recall can be attributed to treatment. 
      Replicating previous findings from studies in healthy volunteers, we observe 
      significant positive affective biases following acute treatment with typical 
      (fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine) and atypical 
      antidepressants (agomelatine, mirtazapine), and significant negative affective 
      biases following treatment with drugs associated with inducing negative affective 
      states in humans (FG7142, rimonabant, 13-cis retinoic acid). We also observed 
      that acute psychosocial stress and environmental enrichment induce significant 
      negative and positive affective biases, respectively, and provide evidence that 
      these affective biases involve memory consolidation. The positive and negative 
      affective biases induced in our test also mirror the antidepressant and 
      pro-depressant effects of these drugs in patients suggesting our test has both 
      translational and predictive validity. Our results suggest that cognitive 
      affective biases could contribute to drug- or stress-induced mood changes in 
      people and support the hypothesis that a cognitive neuropsychological mechanism 
      contributes to antidepressant drug efficacy.

TI  - Acute and long-term sex-dependent effects of social instability stress on 
      anxiety-like and social behaviours in Wistar rats.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical time of social learning in which both the quantity and 
      quality of social interactions shape adult behavior and social function. During 
      adolescence, social instability such as disrupting or limiting social 
      interactions can lead to negative life-long effects on mental health and 
      well-being in humans. Animal models on social instability are critically 
      important in understanding those underlying neurobiological mechanisms. However, 
      studies in rats using these models have produced partly inconsistent results and 
      can be difficult to generalize. Here we assessed in a sex and age consistent 
      manner the long-term behavioural consequences of social instability stress (SIS - 
      1-hr daily isolation and change in cage mate between postnatal day (PD30-45)) in 
      Wistar rats. Female and male rats underwent a battery of tests for anxiety-like, 
      exploratory, and social behaviour over five days beginning either in adolescence 
      (PD46) or in adulthood (PD70). Social instability led to reduced anxiety-like 
      behaviour in the elevated plus maze in both sexes in adolescence and in 
      adulthood. Social interactions were also reduced in rats that underwent SIS - an 
      effect that was independent of sex and age when tested. SIS improved social 
      recognition memory in both sexes whereas a sex-dependent effect was seen in the 
      social novelty preference test where male rats that underwent SIS spent more time 
      in social approach toward a novel peer than toward their cage mate. In 
      comparison, control male and female groups did not differ in this test, in time 
      spent with novel versus the cage mate. Thus, overall, social instability stress 
      in Wistar rats altered the behavioural repertoire, with enduring alterations in 
      social behaviour, enhanced exploratory behaviour, and reduced anxiety-like 
      behaviour. In conclusion, the social instability stress paradigm may better be 
      interpreted as a form of enrichment in Wistar rats than as a stressor.

TI  - Updating Animal Welfare Thinking: Moving beyond the "Five Freedoms" towards "A 
      Life Worth Living".
LID - 10.3390/ani6030021 [doi]
LID - 21
AB  - The Five Freedoms have had major impact on animal welfare thinking 
      internationally. However, despite clear initial statements that the words 
      'freedom from' should indicate 'as free as possible from', the Freedoms have come 
      to be represented as absolute or fundamental freedoms, even rights, by some 
      animal advocate and other groups. Moreover, a marked increase in scientific 
      understanding over the last two decades shows that the Freedoms do not capture 
      the more nuanced knowledge of the biological processes that is germane to 
      understanding animal welfare and which is now available to guide its management. 
      For example, the named negative experiences of thirst, hunger, discomfort and 
      pain, and others identified subsequently, including breathlessness, nausea, 
      dizziness, debility, weakness and sickness, can never be eliminated, merely 
      temporarily neutralised. Each one is a genetically embedded element that 
      motivates animals to behave in particular ways to obtain specific life-sustaining 
      resources, avoid or reduce physical harm or facilitate recovery from infection or 
      injury. Their undoubted negativity creates a necessary sense of urgency to 
      respond, without which animals would not survive. Also, the temporary 
      neutralisation of these survival-critical affects does not in and of itself 
      generate positive experience. This questions the commonly held assumption that 
      good animal welfare will result when these internally generated negative affects 
      are minimised. Animals may also experience other negative affects that include 
      anxiety, fear, panic, frustration, anger, helplessness, loneliness, boredom and 
      depression. These situation-related affects reflect animals' perceptions of their 
      external circumstances. Although they are elicited by threatening, cramped, 
      barren and/or isolated conditions, they can often be replaced by positive affects 
      when animals are kept with congenial others in spacious, stimulus-rich and safe 
      environments which provide opportunities for them to engage in behaviours they 
      find rewarding. These behaviours may include environment-focused exploration and 
      food acquisition activities as well as animal-to-animal interactive activities, 
      all of which can generate various forms of comfort, pleasure, interest, 
      confidence and a sense of control. Animal welfare management should aim to reduce 
      the intensity of survival-critical negative affects to tolerable levels that 
      nevertheless still elicit the required behaviours, and should also provide 
      opportunities for animals to behave in ways they find rewarding, noting that poor 
      management of survival-critical affects reduces animals' motivation to utilize 
      such rewarding opportunities. This biologically more accurate understanding 
      provides support for reviewing the adequacy of provisions in current codes of 
      welfare or practice in order to ensure that animals are given greater 
      opportunities to experience positive welfare states. The purpose is to help 
      animals to have lives worth living, which is not possible when the predominant 
      focus of such codes is on survival-critical measures. Finally, an updated 
      characterisation of animal welfare that incorporates this more accurate 
      understanding is presented.

TI  - Use of the RatLoft decreases pup mortality in lactating mice.
PG  - 370-8
LID - 10.1177/0023677215617388 [doi]
AB  - Lactating mice in laboratory conditions are thought to be under considerable 
      stress. Dams may manifest this stress through a decrease in milk yield and/or 
      increase in infanticide. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 
      access to an environmental enrichment device called the RatLoft on milk yield, 
      circulating serotonin, and pup mortality using both wild-type mice and mice 
      genetically deficient in tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1(-/-); the rate-limiting 
      enzyme in the non-neuronal serotonin synthesis pathway). Presence or absence of 
      the RatLoft did not affect milk yield or circulating serotonin concentrations 
      overall, but serotonin concentrations decreased throughout the 21-day lactation 
      period. Serotonin concentrations were increased in TPH1-deficient mice with 
      access to the RatLoft compared with those without the RatLoft on day 21. Pup 
      mortality tended to decrease for dams with access to the RatLoft as compared to 
      no RatLoft. Within the TPH1(-/-) groups, dams with access to the RatLoft tended 
      to kill less pups per dam than dams without the RatLoft. These results 
      demonstrate that access to the RatLoft during lactation decreases pup infanticide 
      by dams. This environmental enrichment may be particularly beneficial to 
      TPH1(-/-) dams that, in addition to decreased infanticide, had increased 
      serotonin concentrations, possibly indicating enhanced well-being. Use of the 
      RatLoft could prove beneficial to researchers working with lactating mouse models 
      to increase the number of pups weaned and positively impact the welfare of the 
      dam.

TI  - [Anti-depression targets and mechanism study of Kaixin San].
PG  - 472-480

AB  - This study identified the anti-depression targets of Kaixin San(KXS) in the brain 
      tissue with &quot;target fishing&quot; strategy, and explored the 
      target-associated pharmacological signaling pathways to reveal the 
      anti-depression molecular mechanism of KXS. The Balb/c mouse model of depression 
      was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress(CUMS) and the 
      anti-depression effect of KXS was evaluated by forced swimming test and sucrose 
      preference test. KXS active components were bonded to the benzophenone-modified 
      magnetic nanoparticles by photocrosslinking reaction for capturing target 
      proteins from cortex, thalamus and hippocampus of depressive mice. The target 
      proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass 
      spectrometry(LC-MS/MS). The enrichment analysis on signaling pathways was 
      performed by Cytoscape. The potential biological functions of targets were 
      verified by immunohistochemistry and Western blot assay. The results showed that 
      KXS significantly improved the behavioral indexes. There were 64, 91, and 44 
      potential targets of KXS identified in cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus, 
      respectively, according to the target identification experiment. The functions of 
      these targets were mainly associated with vasopressin-regulated water 
      reabsorption, salmonella infection, thyroid hormone synthesis, and other 
      signaling pathways. Besides, the results of immunohistochemistry and Western blot 
      showed that KXS up-regulated the expressions of argipressine(AVP) in the cortex, 
      heat shock protein 60(HSP60), cytochrome C oxidase 4(COX4), and 
      thyrotropin-releasing hormone(TRH) in the thalamus, and down-regulated the 
      expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and nuclear factor kappa B(NF-κB) 
      p65 in the thalamus. Therefore, KXS may exert anti-depression effect through 
      regulating vasopressin signaling pathway in the cortex and inflammation, energy 
      metabolism, and thyroid hormone signaling pathways in the thalamus, and the 
      effect of KXS on hippocampus is not significant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious condition that 
      emerges following trauma exposure and involves long-lasting psychological 
      suffering and health-issues. Uncovering critical genes and molecular networks is 
      essential to understanding the biology of the disorder. We performed a 
      genome-wide scan to identify transcriptome signatures of PTSD. METHODS: 
      Genome-wide peripheral blood transcriptomic data from 380 service personnel were 
      investigated. This included a discovery sample of 96 Australian Vietnam War 
      veterans and two independent pre and post-deployment replication samples of U.S. 
      Marines (N = 188 and N = 96). RESULTS: A total of 60 transcripts were 
      differentially expressed between veterans with and without PTSD, surviving 
      Bonferroni multiple testing correction. Genes within the cytokine-cytokine 
      receptor interaction, Jak-STAT signaling and Toll-like receptor signaling 
      pathways were enriched. For 49% of the genes, gene expression changes were also 
      accompanied by DNA methylation changes. Using replication data from two U.S. 
      Marine cohorts, we observed that of the differentially expressed genes, 71% genes 
      also showed significant gene expression changes between pre and post-deployment. 
      Weighted gene co-expression networks revealed two modules of genes associated 
      with PTSD. The first module (67 genes, p-value = 6e-4) was enriched for genes 
      within the 11p13 locus including BDNF. The second module (266 genes, 
      p-value = 0.01) was enriched for genes in 17q11 including SLC6A4, STAT5A and 
      STAT5B. CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel transcriptomic loci and biological 
      pathways for PTSD in service personnel. Network analysis revealed enrichment of 
      loci harboring key candidate genes in PTSD. These findings highlight the role of 
      transcriptional biomarkers in the molecular etiology of PTSD.

AB  - Mink are potentially ideal for investigating the functions of play: deleterious 
      effects of early social isolation suggest a crucial developmental role for play; 
      and huge numbers of highly playful juvenile subjects can be studied on farms. We 
      collected descriptive data on 186 pairs from 93 litters, half provided with 
      play-eliciting environmental enrichment objects in their home cages, to test 
      three hypotheses: (1) play frequency is subject to litter effects; (2) relative 
      playfulness is stable over time; (3) play sub-types share a single, common 
      motivational basis. We found weak litter effects that were driven by stronger 
      litter effects on general activity, and weakly stable individual differences in 
      both total and rough-and-tumble play. Experimentally increasing object play did 
      not inhibit rough-and-tumble play, showing these sub-types are not motivational 
      substitutes. Frequencies of these sub-types were also uncorrelated, and changed 
      differently with time of day and age, further supporting this conclusion.

TI  - Differential phosphoproteome regulation of nucleus accumbens in environmentally 
      enriched and isolated rats in response to acute stress.
PG  - e79893
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0079893 [doi]

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that stress contributes to the pathogenesis of major 
      depressive disorder which is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder and influences 
      over 10% of the world's population. Our previous studies revealed that rats 
      reared in an enriched environment display less depression-related behavior 
      compared to rats raised in an isolated environment, which implies that 
      environmental enrichment produces an antidepressant-like behavioral phenotype. 
      However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Protein 
      phosphorylation rapidly changes signaling pathway function and alters the 
      function of proteins associated with the stress-induced depressive disorder. 
      Thus, in this study, a phosphoproteomic approach was used to uncover differential 
      phosphoprotein regulation in rat nucleus accumbens between isolated (IC) and 
      enriched environmental conditions (EC) under basal conditions, and in response to 
      acute stress. We found 23 phosphoproteins were regulated in EC vs. IC rats under 
      basal conditions; 10 phosphoproteins regulated by stress in IC rats; and 15 
      regulated by stress in EC rats. Among all significantly regulated 
      phosphoproteins, 11 of them were represented in at least two conditions. The 
      regulated phosphoproteins represent signaling pathway proteins (including ERK2), 
      enzymes, transcriptional regulators, protein translation regulators, 
      transporters, chaperones and cytoskeletal proteins. These findings provide a 
      global view for further understanding the contribution of protein phosphorylation 
      in depression pathogenesis and antidepressant action.

      conditions, such as major depression. Though studies in animal models have 
      demonstrated that individuals reared in different conditions are differently 
      vulnerable to a stressor of a specific quality, no information is available as to 
      whether such vulnerability differs when facing stressors of different qualities. 
      To this purpose, we reared C57BL/6 male mice either in standard laboratory 
      rearing condition (SN) or in Communal Nest (CN) condition, the latter consisting 
      of a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share 
      care-giving behavior until weaning. We scored the amount of interactions with the 
      mother and with peers and found that CN is a form of social enrichment because 
      both these components are significantly increased. At adulthood, we exposed SN 
      and CN mice, for 4 weeks, to either a physical (forced swim) or a social stress 
      (social instability). Immediately before, at week 1 and at week 4 of the stress 
      procedure, corticosterone levels and the hedonic profile were measured. The 
      results show that CN mice are more resilient to social stress than SN mice since 
      they displayed no anhedonia and lower corticosterone levels. By contrast, both 
      experimental groups were similarly vulnerable to physical stress. Overall, our 
      results show that, in male mice, the adult vulnerability to stress changes 
      according to the quality of the stressor, as a function of early experiences. In 
      addition, the stressor to which CN mice are resilient is qualitatively similar to 
      the stimuli they have experienced early on, both concerning the social domain.

TI  - Environmental Enrichment Prevent the Juvenile Hypoxia-Induced Developmental Loss 
      of Parvalbumin-Immunoreactive Cells in the Prefrontal Cortex and Neurobehavioral 
      Alterations Through Inhibition of NADPH Oxidase-2-Derived Oxidative Stress.
PG  - 7341-7350
AB  - We compared the expression of phenotype of parvalbumin (PV)-immunoreactive cells 
      in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of juvenile rats reared in enriched environment 
      (EE) after daily intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposure to those reared in standard 
      environment (SE) and investigated the involvement of NADPH oxidase-2 
      (NOX2)-derived oxidative stress in the IH-induced neurodevelopmental and 
      neurobehavioral consequences in a juvenile rat model of obstructive sleep apnea. 
      Postnatal day 21 (P21) rats were exposed to IH or room air 8 h daily for 14 
      consecutive days. After the daily exposure, the rats were raised in SE or EE. In 
      the PFC of P34 rats, we determined the impact (i) of IH exposures on NOX2-derived 
      oxidative stress and PV immunoreactivity, (ii) of pharmacological NOX2 inhibition 
      on IH-induced oxidative stress and PV immunoreactivity, and (iii) of EE on the 
      IH-induced oxidative stress and PV immunoreactivity. Behavioral testing of 
      psychiatric anxiety was carried out consecutively in the open-field test and 
      elevated plus maze at P35 and P36. The results showed IH exposures increased NOX2 
      expression in the PFC of P34 rats, which was accompanied with elevation of NOX 
      activity and indirect markers of oxidative stress (4-HNE). IH exposures increased 
      4-HNE immunoreactivity in cortical PV cells, which was accompanied with reduction 
      of PV immunoreactivity. Treatment of IH rats with the antioxidant/NOX inhibitor 
      apocynin prevented the PV cells loss in the PFC and reversed the IH-induced 
      psychiatric anxiety. EE attenuated the NOX2-derived oxidative stress and reversed 
      the PV-immunoreactivity reduction in the PFC induced by IH. Our data suggest that 
      EE might prevent the juvenile hypoxia-induced developmental loss of PV cells in 
      the PFC and attenuate the neurobehavioral alterations through inhibition of 
      NOX2-derived oxidative stress.

AB  - Spreading depression (SD), the likely cause of migraine aura and perhaps 
      migraine, is triggered by widespread and unfettered neuronal hyperexcitability. 
      Migraine and the initiating hyperexcitability of seizure, which involve oxidative 
      stress (OS), are likely interrelated. Environmental enrichment (EE) decreases 
      seizure and can reduce migraine. EE's well-characterized neuroprotective effect 
      involves insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Accordingly, we asked if IGF-1 
      could mitigate the hyperexcitability that initiates SD using rat hippocampal 
      slice cultures. We demonstrate that IGF-1 significantly decreased SD 
      susceptibility and related OS. We mimicked OS of SD and observed that IGF-1 
      abolished hyperexcitability from OS. Application of an antioxidant significantly 
      decreased SD susceptibility and co-administration of an antioxidant with IGF-1 
      produced no additive effect, whereas an oxidizer significantly increased SD, and 
      this effect was abrogated by IGF-1. Moreover, IGF-1 significantly decreased 
      baseline OS, despite seemingly paradoxically increasing CA3 bursting. These 
      results suggest that IGF-1 increased endogenous antioxidants to levels sufficient 
      to buffer against the OS of SD. Insulin similarly mitigated SD susceptibility, 
      but required a far greater dose. Since brain IGF-1 increases with EE, and, like 
      insulin, independently functions as an EE mimetic, we suggest that EE mimetics 
      are a novel source of therapeutics for SD, and by extension, migraine.

AB  - Migraine is a common headache disorder characterized by unilateral, intense 
      headaches. In migraine with aura, the painful headache is preceded by focal 
      neurological symptoms that can be visual, sensory, or motor in nature. Spreading 
      depression (the most likely cause of migraine with aura and perhaps related 
      headache pain) results in increased neuronal excitability and related increases 
      in inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species. This in turn can 
      promote the transformation of low-frequency, episodic migraine into 
      higher-frequency and eventually chronic migraine. Though migraine affects 11% of 
      adults worldwide, with 3% experiencing chronic headache, existing therapies offer 
      only modest benefits. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which environmental 
      enrichment (i.e., volitionally increased intellectual, social, and physical 
      activity) mitigates spreading depression. In prior work, we have shown that 
      exposure to environmental enrichment reduces susceptibility to spreading 
      depression in rats. This protective effect is at least in part due to 
      environmental enrichment-mediated changes in the character of serum exosomes 
      produced by circulating immune cells. We went on to show that environmental 
      enrichment-mimetic exosomes can be produced by stimulating dendritic cells with 
      low levels of interferon gamma (a cytokine that is phasically increased during 
      environmental enrichment). Interferon gamma-stimulated dendritic cell exosomes 
      (IFNγ-DC-Exos) significantly improve myelination and reduce oxidative stress when 
      applied to hippocampal slice cultures. Here, we propose that they may also be 
      effective against spreading depression. We found that administration of 
      IFNγ-DC-Exos reduced susceptibility to spreading depression in vivo and in vitro, 
      suggesting that IFNγ-DC-Exos may be a potential therapeutic for migraine.

AB  - Environmental enrichment has been proven to have positive effects on both 
      behavioral and physiological phenotypes in rodent models of mental and 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we used mice lacking the µ-opioid 
      receptor gene (Oprm1 (-/-)), which has been shown to have deficits in social 
      competence and communication, to assess the hypothesis that early enrichment can 
      ameliorate sociability during development and adulthood. Due to the immaturity of 
      sensory-motor capabilities of young pups, we chose as environmental stimulation a 
      second lactating female, who provided extra maternal care and stimulation from 
      birth. The results show that double mothering normalized the abnormal response to 
      maternal separation in Oprm1 (-/-) pups and increased social motivation in 
      juveniles and adult knockout mice. Additionally, we observed that Oprm1 (-/-) 
      mice act as less attractive social partners than wild types, which suggests that 
      social motivation can be modulated by the stimulus employed. This experiment 
      supports previous findings suggesting that early social environmental stimulation 
      has profound and long-term beneficial effects, encouraging the use of 
      nonpharmacological interventions for the treatment of social defects in 
      neurodevelopmental diseases.

AB  - Childhood adversity is related to an increased risk for psychopathology in 
      adulthood. Altered regulation of stress response systems, as well as the changes 
      in stress-immune interplay have been suggested as potential mechanisms underlying 
      these long-term effects. We have previously shown altered transcriptional 
      responses to acute psychosocial stress in adults reporting the experience of 
      childhood adversity. Here, we extend these analyses using a network approach. We 
      performed a co-expression network analysis of genome-wide mRNA data derived from 
      isolated monocytes, sampled 3 h after stress exposure from healthy adults, who 
      experienced childhood adversity and a matched control group without adverse 
      childhood experiences. Thirteen co-expression modules were identified, of which 
      four modules were enriched for genes related to immune system function. Gene set 
      enrichment analysis showed differential module activity between the early 
      adversity and control group. In line with previous findings reporting a 
      pro-inflammatory bias following childhood adversity, one module included genes 
      associated with pro-inflammatory function (hub genes: IL6, TM4SF1, ADAMTS4, 
      CYR61, CCDC3), more strongly expressed in the early adversity group. Another 
      module downregulated in the early adversity group was related to platelet 
      activation and wound healing (hub genes: GP9, CMTM5, TUBB1, GNG11, PF4), and 
      resembled a co-expression module previously found over-expressed in 
      post-traumatic stress disorder resilient soldiers. These discovery analysis 
      results provide a system wide and more holistic understanding of gene expression 
      programs associated with childhood adversity. Furthermore, identified hub genes 
      can be used in directed hypothesis testing in future studies.

AB  - The continuous generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus exhibits 
      remarkable plasticity. Decreased neurogenesis is thought to underlie 
      depression-like behaviors, and increased neurogenesis is thought to occur 
      following antidepressant drug treatment. Studies on different strains of mice, 
      however, yielded contrasting results with regard to the link between behavioral 
      modifications induced by antidepressant drugs or environmental enrichment and 
      changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Therefore, we conducted a comparative 
      study on the inbred strains Balb/c and C57Bl/6 that differ substantially in 
      emotionality, stress reactivity, and behavioral responses to chronic 
      antidepressant drugs. Quantitative assessments of progenitor cell proliferation 
      and immature neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus revealed that, despite 
      significantly different basal proliferation rates between both strains, neither 
      strain exhibited changes in adult neurogenesis after exposure to early life 
      stress or adult chronic fluoxetine treatment. A stimulatory effect of fluoxetine 
      on adult hippocampal neurogenesis was only detected when treatment was initiated 
      during adolescence, and this effect was abolished in mice exposed to early life 
      stress, a prominent risk factor for developing adult-onset depression-like 
      behaviors. Thus, in both strains of mice neither adult fluoxetine treatment nor 
      adolescent fluoxetine treatment following early life stress exposure increased 
      the proliferation and early differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is used to promote natural behaviours in captive 
      animals and may hold promise as a form of pre-release training, a strategy for 
      improving coping skills of translocated birds. We investigated the use of EE to 
      enhance foraging and vigilance behaviours of captive Sporophila angolensis, which 
      may be related to post-release survival. We also evaluated whether consistent 
      individual behavioural differences affected birds' responses to EE. We submitted 
      19 captive seed-finches to three short-term challenges: tonic immobility (TI), 
      new environment (NE) and new object (NO) tests. TI behaviour is related to 
      fear/escape response to potential predators and novelty tests (NE and NO) assess 
      neophobia, which are ecologically relevant personality traits influencing the 
      shyness-boldness continuum. We noted a pronounced variability among the 
      individuals' personality traits, both in their fear and escape-related responses 
      in the TI test and along shy/bold z-scores in NE and NO tests. During a period of 
      enrichment, birds spent more time foraging and less time in vigilance states 
      compared with both control phases. Personality traits of the birds affected their 
      responses to enrichment with bolder birds spending more time foraging. The 
      EE-related decrease in vigilance was independent of the birds' personality 
      traits. Our findings highlight interactions between personality and rearing 
      environment that may impact post-release outcomes for translocated animals.

AB  - Early-life experiences, including parental care, affect cognitive performance 
      later in life. Being exposed to early-life maternal separation (MS) increases 
      susceptibility to stress-related psychopathology. Previous studies suggest that 
      MS could induce learning and memory impairments. Since enriched environment (EE) 
      provides more opportunities for exploration and social interaction, in the 
      present study we evaluated the effects of a short EE paradigm with a duration of 
      13 days on cognitive abilities of maternally separated rats (MS; 180 min/day, 
      postnatal day (PND) 1-21) during adolescence in four experimental groups: 
      Control, Control+EE, MS, and MS+EE. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were also measured in 
      experimental animals. We also studied the induction of long-term potentiation 
      (LTP) in the slices of hippocampal CA1 area. The behavioral and 
      electrophysiological assessments were started at PND 35. MS caused higher basal 
      CORT levels in plasma and impaired spatial learning, memory, and social 
      interaction. LTP induction was also impaired in MS rats and plasma BDNF levels 
      were reduced in these animals. MS also induced more anxiety-like behavior. Short 
      EE reduced plasma CORT levels had the potential to improve locomotor activity and 
      anxiety-like behavior in MS+EE rats and reversed MS-induced impairments of 
      spatial learning, memory, and social behavior. LTP induction and plasma BDNF 
      levels were also enhanced in MS+EE rats. We concluded that short EE might be 
      considered as a therapeutic strategy for promoting cognition.

TI  - Experience Recruits MSK1 to Expand the Dynamic Range of Synapses and Enhance 
      Cognition.
PG  - 4644-4660
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2765-19.2020 [doi]
AB  - Experience powerfully influences neuronal function and cognitive performance, but 
      the cellular and molecular events underlying the experience-dependent enhancement 
      of mental ability have remained elusive. In particular, the mechanisms that 
      couple the external environment to the genomic changes underpinning this 
      improvement are unknown. To address this, we have used male mice harboring an 
      inactivating mutation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), a 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-activated enzyme downstream of the 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that MSK1 is required 
      for the full extent of experience-induced improvement of spatial memory, for the 
      expansion of the dynamic range of synapses, exemplified by the enhancement of 
      hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), and for 
      the regulation of the majority of genes influenced by enrichment. In addition, 
      and unexpectedly, we show that experience is associated with an MSK1-dependent 
      downregulation of key MAPK and plasticity-related genes, notably of EGR1/Zif268 
      and Arc/Arg3.1, suggesting the establishment of a novel genomic landscape adapted 
      to experience. By coupling experience to homeostatic changes in gene expression 
      MSK1, represents a prime mechanism through which the external environment has an 
      enduring influence on gene expression, synaptic function, and 
      cognition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our everyday experiences strongly influence the 
      structure and function of the brain. Positive experiences encourage the growth 
      and development of the brain and support enhanced learning and memory and 
      resistance to mood disorders such as anxiety. While this has been known for many 
      years, how this occurs is not clear. Here, we show that many of the positive 
      aspects of experience depend on an enzyme called mitogen- and stress-activated 
      protein kinase 1 (MSK1). Using male mice with a mutation in MSK1, we show that 
      MSK1 is necessary for the majority of gene expression changes associated with 
      experience, extending the range over which the communication between neurons 
      occurs, and for both the persistence of memory and the ability to learn new task 
      rules.

TI  - Environmental enrichment during adolescence reverses the effects of prenatal 
      stress on play behaviour and HPA axis reactivity in rats.
PG  - 3367-74
AB  - Prenatal stress (PS) can produce profound and long-lasting perturbations of 
      individual adaptive capacities, which in turn can result in an increased 
      proneness to behavioural disorders. Indeed, in PS rats there is evidence of 
      impaired social play behaviour, disturbances in a variety of circadian rhythms, 
      enhanced anxiety and increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      reactivity. This study was designed to experimentally investigate the degree of 
      reversibility of PS-induced disturbances of social play and HPA reactivity by 
      assessing the effect of the enrichment of the physical environment on PS rats 
      during periadolescence. PS subjects showed a reduced expression of social play 
      behaviour and a prolonged corticosterone secretion in response to restraint 
      stress, but both these effects were markedly reversed following environmental 
      enrichment. Interestingly, the enrichment procedure increased social behaviour 
      but had no effect on corticosterone secretion in nonstressed animals, indicating 
      a differential impact of the postnatal environment as a function of prenatal 
      background. As a whole, results clearly indicate that rats prenatally exposed to 
      stress can benefit during periadolescence from the modulatory effects of an 
      enriched environment. Moreover, they confirm that PS may well represent a 
      suitable animal model for the design and testing of new therapeutic strategies 
      for behavioural disorders produced by early insults.

TI  - Ontogenetic Change in Behavioral Responses to Structural Enrichment From Fry to

AB  - Enrichment is widely used as a tool for studying how changes in environment 
      affect animal behavior. Here, we report an experimental study investigating if 
      behaviors shaped by stimuli from environmental enrichment depending on the stage 
      animals are exposed to enrichment. We used juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) 
      in their first autumn. This is a species commonly reared for conservation 
      purposes. Previous work has shown that environmental enrichment had no effect on 
      long-term survival when the fry stage (smaller than 70 mm) was released, but that 
      if late parr stages (larger than 70 mm) are released, enrichment is reported to 
      have a positive effect on smolt migration survival. Here, we explored the effect 
      of enrichment at two different stages of development. Both stages were reared and 
      treated for 7 weeks (fry at 11-18 weeks and parr at 24-31 weeks after hatching) 
      before tested for behavior. Responses known to be associated with exploratory 
      behavior, activity, and stress coping were quantified by testing 18-week-old fry 
      and 31-week-old parr in a six-chamber maze on 7 successive days after rearing in 
      structurally enriched (plastic plants and tubes) or plain impoverished rearing 
      environments. The data show that Atlantic salmon are sensitive to stimuli from 
      structural enrichment when they are parr, but not when in the fry stage. Parr 
      deprived of enrichment (control treatment) were reluctant to start exploring the 
      maze, and when they did, they spent a longer time frozen than enriched parr, 
      suggesting that deprivation of enrichment at this life can be stressful. Our data 
      suggest that structural enrichment could have the potential to improve welfare 
      for salmonids in captivity and for survival of released juvenile salmon if 
      structural enrichment is provided at the parr stage and the fish reared for 
      conservation are released at the parr stage.

AB  - Major depression (MD) is a debilitating mental health condition with peak 
      prevalence occurring early in life. Genome-wide examination of DNA methylation 
      (DNAm) offers an attractive complement to studies of allelic risk given it can 
      reflect the combined influence of genes and environment. The current study used 
      monozygotic twins to identify differentially and variably methylated regions of 
      the genome that distinguish twins with and without a lifetime history of 
      early-onset MD. The sample included 150 Caucasian monozygotic twins between the 
      ages of 15 and 20 (73% female; Mage = 17.52 SD = 1.28) who were assessed during a 
      developmental stage characterized by relatively distinct neurophysiological 
      changes. All twins were generally healthy and currently free of medications with 
      psychotropic effects. DNAm was measured in peripheral blood cells using the 
      Infinium Human BeadChip 450 K Array. MD associations with early-onset MD were 
      detected at 760 differentially and variably methylated probes/regions that mapped 
      to 428 genes. Genes and genomic regions involved neural circuitry formation, 
      projection, functioning, and plasticity. Gene enrichment analyses implicated 
      genes related to neuron structures and neurodevelopmental processes including 
      cell-cell adhesion genes (e.g., PCDHA genes). Genes previously implicated in mood 
      and psychiatric disorders as well as chronic stress (e.g., NRG3) also were 
      identified. DNAm regions associated with early-onset MD were found to overlap 
      genetic loci identified in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 
      meta-analysis of depression. Understanding the time course of epigenetic 
      influences during emerging adulthood may clarify developmental phases where 
      changes in the DNA methylome may modulate individual differences in MD risk.

TI  - Long-lasting modulation of the induction of LTD and LTP in rat hippocampal CA1 by 
      behavioural stress and environmental enrichment.
PG  - 261-72
AB  - Behavioural experience (e.g. chronic stress, environmental enrichment) can have 
      long-lasting effects on cognitive functions. Because activity-dependent 
      persistent changes in synaptic strength are believed to mediate memory processes 
      in brain areas such as hippocampus, we tested whether behaviour has also 
      long-lasting effects on synaptic plasticity by examining the induction of 
      long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in slices of 
      hippocampal CA1 obtained from rats either 7-9 months after social defeat 
      (behavioural stress) or 3-5 weeks after 5-week exposure to environmental 
      enrichment. Compared with age-matched controls, defeated rats showed markedly 
      reduced LTP. LTP was even completely impaired but LTD was enhanced in defeated 
      and, subsequently, individually housed (during the 7-9-month period after defeat) 
      rats. However, increasing stimulus intensity during 100-Hz stimulation resulted 
      in significant LTP. This suggests that the threshold for LTP induction is still 
      raised and that for LTD lowered several months after a short stressful 
      experience. Both LTD and LTP were enhanced in environmentally enriched rats, 3-5 
      weeks after enrichment, as compared with age-matched controls. Because enrichment 
      reduced paired-pulse facilitation, an increase in presynaptic release, 
      facilitating both LTD and LTP induction, might contribute to enhanced synaptic 
      changes. Consistently, enrichment reduced the number of 100-Hz stimuli required 
      for inducing LTP. But enrichment may also actually enhance the range of synaptic 
      modification. Repeated LTP and LTD induction produced larger synaptic changes in 
      enriched than in control rats. These data reveal that exposure to very different 
      behavioural experiences can produce long-lasting effects on the susceptibility to 
      synaptic plasticity, involving pre- and postsynaptic processes.

AB  - Chronic social defeat stress in mice significantly decreases subsequent social 
      interactions and induces other depression-like behaviors. Here we measured and 
      manipulated levels of acetylated histone H3 (acH3), a chromatin mark of 
      transcriptional activation, in the hippocampus and amygdala after ten continuous 
      days of social defeat stress in male C57/Bl6J mice. This form of social stress 
      causes a transient increase, followed by a persistent decrease, in the levels of 
      acH3 in hippocampus. By comparison, increased acH3 in amygdala was more robust 
      but also highly transient. The persistent decrease in acH3 in hippocampus may be 
      pathological, since it is reversed by chronic fluoxetine administration. 
      Consistent with this hypothesis, infusion of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
      inhibitor MS-275 (100 μM) into hippocampus reverses a defeat-induced deficit in 
      sucrose preference, although it does not restore social interaction behavior. 
      Next, different forms of social enrichment were examined with or without 
      hippocampal infusion of MS-275. After social stress, simple pair-housing with 
      another male C57, or female C57, mouse does not reverse social avoidance. 
      However, when HDAC inhibitors are infused into hippocampus during social housing 
      with another male, social avoidance is attenuated. Interestingly, social 
      avoidance is reversed when MS-275 is infused directly into amygdala. Together, 
      these findings further support the antidepressant potential of HDAC inhibitors, 
      and indicate that temporally overlapping environmental and molecular events are 
      required to optimally reverse specific stress-induced behavioral symptoms.

TI  - Malnutrition and brain function: experimental studies using the phenomenon of 
      cortical spreading depression.
PG  - 293-301
AB  - Depending on its intensity and duration, nutritional deficiency can disrupt the 
      structure and function of the nervous system of humans and other mammals, with 
      consequences more or less devastating for the whole organism, particularly in the 
      early postnatal life, when body growth is very rapid and the need for proteins, 
      calories and other nutrients is greatest. In this review, electrophysiological 
      data are presented regarding the use of the phenomenon of cortical spreading 
      depression (CSD) to study effects of malnutrition on the brain. Several 
      conditions of clinical importance and that are known to alter brain function are 
      shown also to influence CSD features in experimental animals. Some of these 
      conditions, (e.g., pharmacological manipulation of neurotransmitter systems, 
      dietary treatment with Lithium, acute hyperglycemia, hypothyroidism, aging and 
      environmental stimulation) decrease CSD susceptibility, while other conditions 
      increase it, as, for example, systemic reduction of extracellular chloride 
      levels, deprivation of REM-sleep, acute hypoglycemia, treatment with diazepam, 
      consumption of ethanol and malnutrition. Particular emphasis is laid on the 
      effect of early environmental enrichment on CSD in normal and malnourished 
      animals. Our results suggest that such effect is more evident in the malnourished 
      brain, as compared to the well-nourished one. The data also show that 
      malnutrition alters the brain responsivity to some CSD-facilitatory or inhibitory 
      agents. The underlying mechanisms to explain the observed effects are discussed.

TI  - Investigation of burnout syndrome and job-related risk factors in veterinary 
      technicians in specialty teaching hospitals: a multicenter cross-sectional study.
PG  - 18-27
LID - 10.1111/vec.12916 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate veterinary technician burnout and associations with 
      frequency of self-reported medical error, resilience, and depression and 
      job-related risk factors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study using an 
      anonymous survey conducted between November 2017 and June 2018. SETTING: Four 
      referral teaching hospitals in the United States and Canada. SUBJECTS: A total of 
      344 veterinary technicians were invited to participate. Response rate was 95%. 
      Overall 256 surveys were ultimately analyzed. INTERVENTIONS: Burnout, depression, 
      and resilience were measured using validated instruments. Respondents reported 
      perceptions of workload, working environment, and medical error frequency. 
      Associations between burnout and factors related to physical work environment, 
      workload and schedule, compensation package, interpersonal relationships, 
      intellectual enrichment, and exposure to ethical conflicts were analyzed. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Burnout, characterized by high emotional 
      exhaustion, depersonalization, and low sense of personal accomplishment was 
      common, and was positively associated with perceived medical errors, desire to 
      change career, and depression. Burnout levels on all 3 burnout subscales were 
      higher in this population than previously reported for a contemporaneous group of 
      trauma nurses working with human patients (P < 0.05). Burnout was negatively 
      associated with resilience. Respondents' feelings of fear or anxiety around 
      supervisor communications, perception that patient load was too high to allow for 
      excellent patient care, and perceived lack of available assistance during sudden 
      workload increases were all associated with burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout in 
      veterinary technicians is common and is associated with numerous undesirable 
      outcomes. Work-related interventions to reduce burnout should focus on improving 
      supervisor relationships and maintaining an appropriate patient:caregiver ratio.

TI  - Neonatal tactile stimulation reverses the effect of neonatal isolation on 
      open-field and anxiety-like behavior, and pain sensitivity in male and female 
      adult Sprague-Dawley rats.
PG  - 91-7
AB  - It is well known that early life events induce long-lasting psychophysiological 
      and psychobiological influences in later life. In rodent studies, environmental 
      enrichment after weaning prevents the adulthood behavioral and emotional 
      disturbances in response to early adversities. We compared the behavioral effect 
      of neonatal isolation (NI) with the effect of NI accompanied by tactile 
      stimulation (NTS) to determine whether NTS could reverse or prevent the effects 
      of NI on the adulthood behavioral and emotional responses to environmental 
      stimuli. In addition, we also examined the sex difference of the NTS effect. 
      Measurements of body weights, an open-field locomotor test, an elevated plus maze 
      test, a hot-plate test, and a contextual fear-conditioning test were performed on 
      postnatal day 60. As compared with rats subjected to NI, rats subjected to NTS 
      showed significantly higher activity and exploration in the open-field locomotor 
      test, lower anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test, and 
      significantly prolonged latencies in the hot-plate test, and this effect was 
      equal among males and females. In the contextual fear-conditioning test, whereas 
      NTS significantly reduced the enhanced freezing time due to NI in females, no 
      significant difference in the freezing time between NI and NTS was found in 
      males. These findings indicate that adequate tactile stimulation in early life 
      plays an important role in the prevention of disturbances in the behavioral and 
      emotional responses to environmental stimuli in adulthood induced by early 
      adverse experiences.

TI  - Selective breeding for divergence in novelty-seeking traits: heritability and 
      enrichment in spontaneous anxiety-related behaviors.
PG  - 697-712
AB  - Outbred Sprague-Dawley rats can be classified as high responders (HR) or low 
      responders (LR) based on their levels of exploratory locomotion in a novel 
      environment. While this novelty-seeking dimension was originally related to 
      differential vulnerability to substance abuse, behavioral, neuroendocrine and 
      gene expression studies suggest a fundamental difference in emotional reactivity 
      between these animals. Here, we report the first study to selectively breed rats 
      based on this novelty-seeking dimension. Response to novelty was clearly 
      heritable, with a > 2-fold difference in behavior seen after eight generations of 
      selection. Three tests of anxiety-like behavior consistently showed significantly 
      greater anxiety in LR-bred rats compared to HR-bred animals, and this difference 
      was diminished in the open field test by administration of the anxiolytic 
      benzodiazepine drug, chlordiazepoxide. Cross-fostering revealed that responses to 
      novelty were largely unaffected by maternal interactions, though there was an 
      effect on anxiety-like behavior. These selected lines will enable future research 
      on the interplay of genetic, environmental and developmental variables in 
      controlling drug seeking behavior, stress and emotional reactivity.

TI  - "Sparks that became a little light over time": A qualitative investigation of 
      musicking as a means of coping in adults with PTSD.
PG  - e0228050
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0228050 [doi]
LID - e0228050
AB  - This article investigates the experience of musicking (the performance of musical 
      activity) among people coping with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using 
      qualitative research methods, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews 
      with 10 male participants in a music project for people coping with PTSD induced 
      by war and terrorism. The project consists of individual music lessons once a 
      week and a musical enrichment group that meets once a month. Group meetings 
      include workshops and lectures by music professionals and artists, during which 
      participants are exposed to diverse musical content. Following an interpretive 
      phenomenological content analysis, we were able to identify two central themes 
      arising from the interviews: musicking as an intra-subjective experience and 
      musicking as mediator of inter-subjective relationships. A further analysis 
      revealed three superordinate themes: musicking as a secure place, musicking as a 
      dialectic experience, and musicking as a means for identity reconstruction 
      (bridging between past, present, and future). From this we concluded that for our 
      interviewees musicking is a secure place for their wounded self, which allows the 
      reconstruction of a coherent personal narrative while conducting a dialectic 
      encounter with the trauma and its symptoms via nonverbal language. Consequently, 
      we recommend musicking as a therapeutic tool for people coping with war-induced 
      PTSD from both intrapersonal and interpersonal perspectives.

TI  - Adolescent enrichment partially reverses the social isolation syndrome.
PG  - 103-15
AB  - Early environmental experience produces profound neural and behavioural effects. 
      For example, animals reared in isolation show increased anxiety, neophobia, and 
      poorer performance in learning and spatial memory tasks. We investigated whether 
      later enrichment reverses some or all of the deficits induced by isolation 
      rearing. Eighty-four male Long-Evans rats (21 days old) were reared under 
      different conditions: enriched (group housed with toys), isolated (one rat/cage), 
      standard (two rats/cage), isolated-enriched, enriched-isolated, 
      isolated-standard, or enriched-standard. In the latter four conditions, animals 
      were housed in the first environment until adolescence (66 days). Following the 
      90-day rearing period, all animals were assessed in a battery of behavioural 
      tests and cortical thickness was measured postmortem. Isolation rearing led to 
      significant differences in behavioural tests measuring anxiety, spatial learning, 
      and locomotor activity; switching the rearing condition partially reversed these 
      changes. Rearing condition did not affect pain thresholds in the tail flick test 
      or aversive associative learning in the conditioned taste aversion test. Enriched 
      rats had the thickest cortex; isolated rats the thinnest. None of the switch 
      groups differed significantly from standard-reared rats in this measure. Taken 
      together, these results provide novel and interesting information regarding the

TI  - Opposing manner of miR-455-3p against NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the cortex and 
      hippocampus of depressive rats under simulated complex space environment.
LID - 10.1111/jnc.15766 [doi]
AB  - Depression in astronauts is one of the consequences of space flight effects, 
      negatively impacting their work performances. Unfortunately, the underlying 
      molecular mechanisms in space flight-induced depression are still unknown; 
      however, various neuropsychiatric disorders reported that overexpressed 
      NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the brain triggers various pathological pathways, and 
      inhibiting NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex asserts antidepressant effects. Through our 
      in silico analysis, we found that epigenetic regulator miR-445-3p targets PSD-95 
      and is hypothesized to down-regulate NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex to prevent neuronal 
      damage associated with depression. Therefore, the present study is aimed to 
      determine the novel insight of the miR-455-3p against the NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS 
      complex in the neurobiology of space flight-induced depressive behavior. Using a 
      simulated space environment complex model (SCSE) for 21 days, we induced 
      depressive behavior in rats to analyze miR-455-3p expression and NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS 
      complex in the cortex and hippocampus of the SCSE depressed rats through qRT-PCR 
      and western blot analysis. Further, an in vitro microgravity model using rat 
      hippocampus cell lines (RHNC) was utilized to identify the independent role of 
      miR-455-3p on (1) NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex and TrKB-BDNF proteins, (2) oxidative 
      stress, (3) nitric oxide level, (4) inflammatory cytokines, (5) mitochondrial 
      biogenesis/ dynamics, and (6) cell survival. Our results showed that miR-455-3p 
      regulates NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the SCSE depressed rats in opposite ways, 
      with the cortex revealing a higher level of miR-455-3p and low-level 
      NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex and the hippocampus showing down-regulated miR-455-3p 
      and up-regulated NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex, indicating a region-specific change in 
      the miR-455-3p and NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex in the SCSE depressed rats. Further 
      RHNC results also confirmed down-regulated miR-455-3p and up-regulated 
      NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex expression, similar to the findings in the hippocampus 
      of SCSE rats, suggesting that microgravity influences miR-455-3p and associated 
      changes. Additional investigations revealed that miR-455-3p targets PSD-95 and 
      co-regulates NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex along with TrkB-BDNF signaling and exert 
      protective effects against NR2B-PSD-95-nNOS complex, oxidative stress, nitric 
      oxide, inflammatory cytokines, and mitochondrial defects, suggesting a valuable 
      biomarker for devising depressive disorders.

TI  - Gene expression analysis indicates reduced memory and cognitive functions in the 
      hippocampus and increase in synaptic reorganization in the frontal cortex 3 weeks 
      after MDMA administration in Dark Agouti rats.
PG  - 580

AB  - BACKGROUND: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy") is a widely used 
      entactogenic drug known to impair cognitive functions on the long-run. Both 
      hippocampal and frontal cortical regions have well established roles in behavior, 
      memory formation and other cognitive tasks and damage of these regions is 
      associated with altered behavior and cognitive functions frequently described in 
      otherwise healthy MDMA users. Meanwhile, in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
      patients seem to benefit from therapeutic application of the drug, where damage 
      in hippocampal cue extinction may play a role. The aim of this study was to 
      examine the hippocampus, frontal cortex and dorsal raphe of Dark Agouti rats with 
      gene expression arrays (Illumina RatRef bead arrays) looking for possible 
      mechanisms and new candidates contributing to the consequences of a single dose 
      of MDMA (15 mg/kg) 3 weeks earlier. RESULTS: The number of differentially 
      expressed genes in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and the dorsal raphe were 481, 
      155, and 15, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis of the microarray data 
      revealed reduced expression of 'memory' and 'cognition', 'dendrite development' 
      and 'regulation of synaptic plasticity' gene sets in the hippocampus, parallel to 
      the downregulation of CaMK II subunits, glutamate-, CB1 cannabinoid- and EphA4, 
      EphA5, EphA6 receptors. Downregulated gene sets in the frontal cortex were 
      related to protein synthesis, chromatin organization, transmembrane transport 
      processes, while 'dendrite development', 'regulation of synaptic plasticity' and 
      'positive regulation of synapse assembly' gene sets were upregulated besides 
      elevated levels of a CaMK II subunit and NMDA2B glutamate receptor. Changes in 
      the dorsal raphe region were mild and in most cases not significant. CONCLUSION: 
      The present data raise the possibility of new synapse formation / synaptic 
      reorganization in the frontal cortex 3 weeks after a single neurotoxic dose of 
      MDMA. In contrast, a prolonged depression of new neurite formation in the 
      hippocampus is proposed by downregulations of members in long-term potentiation 
      pathway and synaptic plasticity emphasizing the particular vulnerability of this 
      brain region and proposing a mechanism responsible for cognitive problems in 
      healthy individuals. At the same time, these results underpin benefits of MDMA in 
      PTSD, where the drug may help memory extinction.

AB  - Chronic stress is one of the predominant environmental risk factors for a number 
      of psychiatric disorders, particularly for major depression. Different hypotheses 
      have been formulated to address the interaction between early and adult chronic 
      stress in psychiatric disease vulnerability. The match/mismatch hypothesis of 
      psychiatric disease states that the early life environment shapes coping 
      strategies in a manner that enables individuals to optimally face similar 
      environments later in life. We tested this hypothesis in female Balb/c mice that 
      underwent either stress or enrichment early in life and were in adulthood further 
      subdivided in single or group housed, in order to provide aversive or positive 
      adult environments, respectively. We studied the effects of the environmental 
      manipulation on anxiety-like, depressive-like and sociability behaviors and gene 
      expression profiles. We show that continuous exposure to adverse environments 
      (matched condition) is not necessarily resulting in an opposite phenotype 
      compared to a continuous supportive environment (matched condition). Rather, 
      animals with mismatched environmental conditions behaved differently from animals 
      with matched environments on anxious, social and depressive like phenotypes. 
      These results further support the match/mismatch hypothesis and illustrate how 
      mild or moderate aversive conditions during development can shape an individual 
      to be optimally adapted to similar conditions later in life.

TI  - Enhanced cognitive activity--over and above social or physical activity--is 
      required to protect Alzheimer's mice against cognitive impairment, reduce Abeta 
      deposition, and increase synaptic immunoreactivity.
PG  - 277-94
AB  - Although social, physical, and cognitive activities have each been suggested to 
      reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), epidemiologic studies cannot 
      determine which activity or combination of activities is most important. To 
      address this question, mutant APP transgenic AD mice were reared long-term in one 
      of four housing conditions (impoverished, social, social+physical, or complete 
      enrichment) from 1(1/2) through 9 months of age. Thus, a stepwise layering of 
      social, physical, and enhanced cognitive activity was created. Behavioral 
      evaluation in a full battery of sensorimotor, anxiety, and cognitive tasks was 
      carried out during the final 5 weeks of housing. Only AD mice raised in complete 
      enrichment (i.e., enhanced cognitive activity) showed: (1) protection against 
      cognitive impairment, (2) decreased brain beta-amyloid deposition, and (3) 
      increased hippocampal synaptic immunoreactivity. The protection provided by 
      enhanced cognitive activity spanned multiple cognitive domains (working memory, 
      reference learning, and recognition/identification). Cognitive and 
      neurohistologic benefits of complete enrichment occurred without any changes in 
      blood cytokine or corticosterone levels, suggesting that enrichment-dependent 
      mechanisms do not involve changes in the inflammatory response or stress levels, 
      respectively. These results indicate that the enhanced cognitive activity of 
      complete enrichment is required for cognitive and neurologic benefit to AD 
      mice-physical and/or social activity are insufficient. Thus, our data suggest 
      that humans who emphasize a high lifelong level of cognitive activity (over and 
      above social and physical activities) will attain the maximal environmental 
      protection against AD.

TI  - Real-time imaging of amygdalar network dynamics in vitro reveals a 
      neurophysiological link to behavior in a mouse model of extremes in trait 
      anxiety.
PG  - 16262-7

AB  - In humans and numerous other mammalian species, individuals considerably vary in 
      their level of trait anxiety. This well known phenomenon is closely related to 
      the etiology of several psychiatric disorders, but its neurophysiological basis 
      remains poorly understood. Here, we applied voltage-sensitive dye imaging to 
      brain slices from animals of the high (HAB), normal (NAB), and low (LAB) trait 
      anxiety mouse model and investigated whether evoked neuronal activity 
      propagations from the lateral (LA) to the central (CeA) amygdala differ in their 
      relative strength among HAB, NAB, and LAB mice. For this purpose, we divided a 
      real-time measure of neuronal population activity in the CeA by a respective 
      measure obtained for the LA. This calculation yielded the metric "CeA/LA 
      activity." Our data clearly demonstrate a positive correlation between trait 
      anxiety levels evaluated by the elevated plus-maze test and CeA/LA activity. 
      Moreover, we found reduced CeA/LA activity in HAB mice, which responded with 
      decreased anxiety levels to an environmental enrichment and, inversely, detected 
      increased anxiety levels and CeA/LA activity in LAB mice that experienced chronic 
      mild stress. We did not observe differences in the spread of neuronal activity in 
      the motor and visual cortex among HAB, NAB, and LAB animals. Collectively, these 
      findings provide evidence that, in mammals, interindividual variability in trait 
      anxiety is causally linked to individual variations in the physiological 
      constitution of the LA-to-CeA circuitry that give rise to a differential 
      regulation of neuronal signal flow through this fundamental input-output network 
      of the amygdala.

AB  - We examined the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and gene 
      expression using whole blood samples from a cohort of trauma-exposed white 
      non-Hispanic male veterans (115 cases and 28 controls). 10,264 probes of genes 
      and gene transcripts were analyzed. We found 41 that were differentially 
      expressed in PTSD cases versus controls (multiple-testing corrected p<0.05). The 
      most significant was DSCAM, a neurological gene expressed widely in the 
      developing brain and in the amygdala and hippocampus of the adult brain. We then 
      examined the 41 differentially expressed genes in a meta-analysis using two 
      replication cohorts and found significant associations with PTSD for 7 of the 41 
      (p<0.05), one of which (ATP6AP1L) survived multiple-testing correction. There was 
      also broad evidence of overlap across the discovery and replication samples for 
      the entire set of genes implicated in the discovery data based on the direction 
      of effect and an enrichment of p<0.05 significant probes beyond what would be 
      expected under the null. Finally, we found that the set of differentially 
      expressed genes from the discovery sample was enriched for genes responsive to 
      glucocorticoid signaling with most showing reduced expression in PTSD cases 
      compared to controls.

TI  - Effects of environmental enrichment on behavioral responses to novelty, learning, 
      and memory, and the circadian rhythm in cortisol in growing pigs.
PG  - 571-8
AB  - Previously we showed that pigs reared in an enriched environment had higher 
      baseline salivary cortisol concentrations during the light period than pigs 
      reared under barren conditions. In the present experiment, it was investigated 
      whether these higher baseline salivary cortisol concentrations were a real 
      difference in cortisol concentration or merely represented a phase difference in 
      circadian rhythm. The effects of different cortisol concentrations on the 
      behavioral responses to novelty and learning and long-term memory in a maze test 
      were also studied in enriched and barren housed pigs. At 9 weeks of age enriched 
      and barren housed pigs did not differ in baseline salivary cortisol 
      concentrations nor in circadian rhythm, but at 22 weeks of age barren housed pigs 
      had a blunted circadian rhythm in salivary cortisol as compared to enriched 
      housed pigs. The differences in baseline salivary cortisol concentrations between 
      enriched- and barren-housed pigs are age-dependent, and become visible after 15 
      weeks of age. Enriched- and barren-housed piglets did not differ in time spent on 
      exploration in the novel environment test. Barren-housed pigs had an impaired 
      long-term memory in the maze test compared to enriched-housed pigs; however, no 
      differences in learning abilities between enriched- and barren-housed pigs were 
      found. Because blunted circadian cortisol rhythms are often recorded during 
      states of chronic stress in pigs and rats or during depression in humans, it is 
      suggested that the blunted circadian rhythm in cortisol in barren-housed pigs 
      similarily may reflect decreased welfare.

AB  - The mammalian brain has evolved in close synchrony with the natural environment; 
      consequently, trends toward disengagement from natural environments in today's 
      industrialized societies may compromise adaptive neural responses and lead to 
      psychiatric illness. Investigations of rodents housed in enriched environments 
      indicate enhanced neurobiological complexity; yet, the origin of these stimuli, 
      natural vs. manufactured, has not been sufficiently explored. In the current 
      study, groups of rats were exposed to one of three environments: (1) a standard 
      environment with only food and water, (2) an artificial-enriched environment with 
      manufactured stimuli and (3) a natural-enriched environment with natural stimuli. 
      Results indicated that, during the dark phase, natural-enriched animals exhibited 
      longer durations interacting with objects than the artificial-enriched group; 
      further, the natural-enriched group engaged in more social behavior than the 
      other two groups. Both enriched groups exhibited less anxiety in response to a 
      novel object but the natural-enriched rats exhibited less anxiety-typical 
      behavior in response to a predator odor than the other groups. Less fos 
      activation in the amygdala was observed in both enriched groups following a water 
      escape task whereas an increase in fos activation in the nucleus accumbens was 
      observed in the natural-enriched animals. Thus, the current findings indicate the 
      potential importance of exposure to complex environments, especially natural-like 
      habitats, in the maintenance of emotional health, perhaps providing a buffer 
      against the emergence of anxiogenic responses.

TI  - Genome-wide gene-environment interaction in depression: A systematic evaluation 
      of candidate genes: The childhood trauma working-group of PGC-MDD.
PG  - 40-49
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32593 [doi]
AB  - Gene by environment (GxE) interaction studies have investigated the influence of 
      a number of candidate genes and variants for major depressive disorder (MDD) on 
      the association between childhood trauma and MDD. Most of these studies are 
      hypothesis driven and investigate only a limited number of SNPs in relevant 
      pathways using differing methodological approaches. Here (1) we identified 27 
      genes and 268 SNPs previously associated with MDD or with GxE interaction in MDD 
      and (2) analyzed their impact on GxE in MDD using a common approach in 3944 
      subjects of European ancestry from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium who had 
      completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. (3) We subsequently used the 
      genome-wide SNP data for a genome-wide case-control GxE model and GxE case-only 
      analyses testing for an enrichment of associated SNPs. No genome-wide significant 
      hits and no consistency among the signals of the different analytic approaches 
      could be observed. This is the largest study for systematic GxE interaction 
      analysis in MDD in subjects of European ancestry to date. Most of the known 
      candidate genes/variants could not be supported. Thus, their impact on GxE 
      interaction in MDD may be questionable. Our results underscore the need for 
      larger samples, more extensive assessment of environmental exposures, and greater 
      efforts to investigate new methodological approaches in GxE models for MDD.

AB  - Developmental and social factors are known to play a crucial role in the 
      pathogenesis of affective disorders. Although it has been demonstrated that early 
      life aversive experiences can be a risk factor in the development of human 
      depression, most of the investigation in animals that try to model depression do 
      not include postnatal manipulations. Since housing represents a fundamental 
      ethological factor which modifies behavior and brain development, this study 
      aimed to investigate the impact of different social and structural housing 
      conditions on the development of a depressive-like syndrome in the behavioral 
      despair paradigm and an anxiety-like syndrome in the unconditioned anxiety 
      paradigm. The present study uses several multivariate analyses to study the 
      impact of housing conditions in animal models of depression and anxiety. In this 
      study, social isolation was able to reproduce the effects found in other animals 
      models based on stress, suggesting that only 2 months of social isolation are 
      enough to produce effects that can be useful as behavioral model of depression. 
      Moreover, environmental enrichment showed an antidepressive and anxiolytic like 
      effect in animal models of depression and anxiety. This effect, which has not 
      been reported in earlier studies, suggests that stimulation during the first 
      stages of growth might play a "protective" role on behavior and brain 
      development.

TI  - Feeding neophobia: a possible explanation for the differential maze performance 
      of rats reared in enriched or isolated environments.
PG  - 191-201
AB  - This study undertook a detailed examination of the now-classical isolate maze 
      deficit. Three male littermates from each of 19 litters were exposed to early and 
      lengthy environmental enrichment, isolation, or isolation plus frequent handling. 
      At 120 days of age subjects were tested on the open field, on an emergence task, 
      and in a complex maze. Subjects were allowed to enter and leave the maze goal box 
      at will. Only after eating for 30 seconds were they captured and replaced in the 
      start box for the next trial. In the open field and emergence tasks the enriched 
      and isolate rats both showed symptoms of much greater timidity than the 
      experimenter-adapted handled rats. In the maze, enriched rats increased goal box 
      entries over days, handled and non-handled isolates did not. By day three, 
      handled and non-handled isolate goal entries were significantly lower than for 
      enriched rats. This finding suggests an intellectual deficit in isolate maze 
      learning. However, error analysis revealed that even on day one, all groups made 
      errors at a rate far below random. The pattern of errors implied that subjects 
      were often actively avoiding the goal, with isolates turning aside before 
      entering the goal significantly more often than enriched rats. These findings 
      suggest that the isolate maze deficit is due to a form of feeding neophobia. More 
      generally, it would appear that these behavioral differences reflect early 
      learning, with handled rats less afraid of humans and enriched rats better 
      adapted to eating in novel surroundings.

TI  - Effects of caffeic acid on epigenetics in the brain of rats with chronic 
      unpredictable mild stress.
PG  - 5358-5368
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2020.11609 [doi]
AB  - The present study hypothesized that caffeic acid (3,4‑dihydroxycinnamic 
      acid; CaA) may exert antidepressant‑like effects in rats with chronic 
      unpredictable mild stress via epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and 
      hydroxymethylation. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was used 
      to analyze the effects of CaA on behavioral phenotypes, and to evaluate the 
      distribution of 5‑methylcytosine (5mC) and 5‑hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the 
      hippocampus and prefrontal cortex using immunohistochemistry and 
      immunofluorescence. mRNA levels of the genes encoding brain‑derived neurotropic 
      factor (BDNF) and catechol‑O‑methyltransferase (COMT), and key enzymes regulating 
      DNA methylation [DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 and DNMT3A] and hydroxymethylation 
      [Ten‑eleven translocation (TET)1‑3] were examined using quantitative (q)PCR. 
      Furthermore, enrichment of 5mC and 5hmC at the promotor regions of the Bdnf and 
      Comt genes was quantified using chromatin immunoprecipitation‑qPCR. Behavioral 
      data showed that CaA exerted a slight antidepressant‑like effect. Bdnf and Comt 
      genes showed differential expression patterns due to CUMS. CaA intervention 
      induced different Dnmt1/Dnmt3a and Tet1/Tet2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus and 
      prefrontal cortex, respectively. CaA regulated the ratio of 5mC/5hmC at the 
      promotor region of the Bdnf and Comt genes and therefore influenced gene 
      expression, which may be a valuable therapeutic option for major depressive 
      disorder (MDD). In conclusion, there were epigenetic changes in the hippocampus 
      and prefrontal cortex in CUMS rats, and CaA may function as a modulator of DNA 
      methylation to regulate gene transcription, thus providing a mechanistic basis 
      for the use of this phytochemical agent in the treatment of MDD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional antidepressants usually require several weeks to achieve 
      a full clinical response in patients with major depressive disorder, an illness 
      associated with dysregulated circadian rhythms and a high incidence of 
      suicidality. Two rapid-acting antidepressant strategies, low-dose ketamine (KT) 
      and sleep deprivation (SD) therapies, dramatically reduce depressive symptoms 
      within 24 hours in a subset of major depressive disorder patients. However, it is 
      unknown whether they exert their actions through shared regulatory mechanisms. To 
      address this question, we performed comparative transcriptomics analyses to 
      identify candidate genes and relevant pathways common to KT and SD. METHODS: We 
      used the forced swim test, a standardized behavioral approach to measure 
      antidepressant-like activity of KT and SD. We investigated gene expression 
      changes using high-density microarrays and pathway analyses (Gene Ontology, Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) in KT- and 
      SD-treated mice compared with saline-treated control male mice. RESULTS: We show 
      that KT and SD elicit common transcriptional responses implicating distinct 
      elements of the circadian clock and processes involved in neuronal plasticity. 
      There is an overlap of 64 genes whose expression is common in KT and SD. 
      Specifically, there is downregulation of clock genes including Ciart, Per2, 
      Npas4, Dbp, and Rorb in both KT- and SD-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate 
      a potential involvement of the circadian clock in rapid antidepressant responses. 
      These findings could open new research avenues to help design 
      chronopharmacological strategies to treat major depressive disorder.

AB  - Developmental mechanisms that shape behaviour are under environmental as well as 
      genetic influence, commonly referred to as gene-by-environment interaction (GxE). 
      Here, we compared the role of different early environments - adverse, standard, 
      and enriched - for the modulation of the anxiety profile in mice varying in 
      serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype. Early-life adversity was simulated by 
      exposing lactating 5-HTT +/- dams to soiled bedding of unfamiliar males (UMB), 
      signalling the danger of infanticide. An enriched early environment was 
      established by communal nesting (CN). 5-HTT +/- females of a third group were 
      housed under standard nesting conditions (SN) of individual nesting. The 
      offspring (5-HTT +/+, 5-HTT +/-, and 5-HTT -/-) were analyzed for anxiety-like 
      and exploratory behaviour in a battery of tests. The main findings were: (1) 
      Maternal care was reduced in UMB compared to CN dams. (2) There was no 
      significant variation in state anxiety levels between UMB, SN, and CN offspring. 
      (3) UMB offspring showed significantly lower levels of trait anxiety compared to 
      CN offspring, while SN offspring were intermediate. (4) There was a significant 
      main effect of genotype, with highest levels of state and trait anxiety in 5-HTT 
      -/- mice. The findings corroborate that anxiety profiles in mice can be affected 
      by both early environmental conditions and 5-HTT genotype. Notably, state and 
      trait anxiety of an individual can independently be affected by the early 
      environment.

AB  - Early childhood deprivation is associated with higher rates of neurodevelopmental 
      and mental disorders in adulthood. The impact of childhood deprivation on the 
      adult brain and the extent to which structural changes underpin these effects are 
      currently unknown. To investigate these questions, we utilized MRI data collected 
      from young adults who were exposed to severe deprivation in early childhood in 
      the Romanian orphanages of the Ceaușescu era and then, subsequently adopted by UK 
      families; 67 Romanian adoptees (with between 3 and 41 mo of deprivation) were 
      compared with 21 nondeprived UK adoptees. Romanian adoptees had substantially 
      smaller total brain volumes (TBVs) than nondeprived adoptees (8.6% reduction), 
      and TBV was strongly negatively associated with deprivation duration. This effect 
      persisted after covarying for potential environmental and genetic confounds. In 
      whole-brain analyses, deprived adoptees showed lower right inferior frontal 
      surface area and volume but greater right inferior temporal lobe thickness, 
      surface area, and volume than the nondeprived adoptees. Right medial prefrontal 
      volume and surface area were positively associated with deprivation duration. No 
      deprivation-related effects were observed in limbic regions. Global reductions in 
      TBV statistically mediated the observed relationship between institutionalization 
      and both lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and higher levels of attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. The deprivation-related increase in 
      right inferior temporal volume seemed to be compensatory, as it was associated 
      with lower levels of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. We 
      provide compelling evidence that time-limited severe deprivation in the first 
      years of life is related to alterations in adult brain structure, despite 
      extended enrichment in adoptive homes in the intervening years.

AB  - The etiology of individual differences in human anxiousness is complex and 
      includes contributions from genetic, epigenetic (i.e., DNA methylation) and 
      environmental factors. Past genomic approaches have been limited in their ability 
      to detect human anxiety-related differences in these factors. To overcome these 
      limitations, we employed both a multi-dimensional characterization method, to 
      select monozygotic twin pairs discordant for anxiety, and whole genome DNA 
      methylation sequencing. This approach revealed 230 anxiety-related differentially 
      methylated loci that were annotated to 183 genes, including several known 
      stress-related genes such as NAV1, IGF2, GNAS, and CRTC1. As an initial 
      validation of these findings, we tested the significance of an overlap of these 
      data with anxiety-related differentially methylated loci that we previously 
      reported from a key neural circuit of anxiety (i.e., the central nucleus of the 
      amygdala) in young monkeys and found a significant overlap (P-value < 0.05) of 
      anxiety-related differentially methylated genes, including GNAS, SYN3, and JAG2. 
      Finally, sequence motif predictions of all the human differentially methylated 
      regions indicated an enrichment of five transcription factor binding motifs, 
      suggesting that DNA methylation may regulate gene expression by mediating 
      transcription factor binding of these transcripts. Together, these data 
      demonstrate environmentally sensitive factors that may underlie the development 
      of human anxiety.

      between the LSAMP gene and several psychiatric disorders have been found and 
      LSAMP has been established as a tumour suppressor gene. To study the impact of 
      environmental manipulations on the phenotype, we exposed male Lsamp-deficient 
      mice to environmental enrichment (EE), a technique that has often been shown to 
      abolish phenotypic deviations in knockout mice, and to social isolation, a 
      stressful manipulation, after which all the mice were tested in a behavioural 
      battery. EE abolished differences between the genotypes in body weight and 
      anogenital sniffing, a behaviour related to aggressiveness, and amplified the 
      anxiolytic-like phenotype of Lsamp-deficient mice both in the plus maze and 
      motility box. Isolation abolished differences between the genotypes in body 
      weight and anxiety and amplified the differences in swimming speed and anogenital 
      sniffing. EE and isolation failed to modify the results as compared to standard 
      housing in whisker trimming, locomotor activity, marble burying and 
      corticosterone levels. In conclusion, Lsamp-deficient mice were less sensitive to 
      isolation stress than their wild-type littermates. Lack of LAMP protein seemingly 
      leads to a deterioration in the ability to adapt to novel stressful environments 
      and stimuli.

TI  - Individual Patterns of Abnormality in Resting-State Functional Connectivity 
      Reveal Two Data-Driven PTSD Subgroups.
PG  - 244-253
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19010060 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A major challenge in understanding and treating posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) is its clinical heterogeneity, which is likely determined by 
      various neurobiological perturbations. This heterogeneity likely also reduces the 
      effectiveness of standard group comparison approaches. The authors tested whether 
      a statistical approach aimed at identifying individual-level neuroimaging 
      abnormalities that are more prevalent in case subjects than in control subjects 
      could reveal new clinically meaningful insights into the heterogeneity of PTSD. 
      METHODS: Resting-state functional MRI data were recorded from 87 unmedicated PTSD 
      case subjects and 105 war zone-exposed healthy control subjects. Abnormalities 
      were modeled using tolerance intervals, which referenced the distribution of 
      healthy control subjects as the "normative population." Out-of-norm functional 
      connectivity values were examined for enrichment in cases and then used in a 
      clustering analysis to identify biologically defined PTSD subgroups based on 
      their abnormality profiles. RESULTS: The authors identified two subgroups among 
      PTSD cases, each with a distinct pattern of functional connectivity abnormalities 
      with respect to healthy control subjects. Subgroups differed clinically on levels 
      of reexperiencing symptoms and improved case-control discriminability and were 
      detectable using independently recorded resting-state EEG data. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results provide proof of concept for the utility of abnormality-based approaches 
      for studying heterogeneity within clinical populations. Such approaches, applied 
      not only to neuroimaging data, may allow detection of subpopulations with 
      distinct biological signatures so that further clinical and mechanistic 
      investigations can be focused on more biologically homogeneous subgroups.

AB  - In the present study, we analyzed the effects of enriched, social and isolated 
      experiences on vermal Purkinje cell of the rat, together with anxiety-like 
      behavior in the elevated-plus maze. Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly 
      submitted to either enriched, social, or isolated environments during the early 
      postweaning period (postnatal days 22-32) and were then behaviorally evaluated in 
      the elevated-plus maze and euthanized for histological analysis. Vermal Purkinje 
      cells (sub-lobules VIa and VIb) were sampled, drawn under camera lucida and 
      morphometrically assessed using the Sholl's concentric ring method. Data obtained 
      indicate that environmental enrichment did not significantly modify the Purkinje 
      cell dendritic branching. On the contrary, Purkinje cell of animals reared in 
      social isolation exhibited a significant reduction in dendritic arborization, 
      which was closely associated with anxiety-like behaviors. The data obtained 
      indicate that, although environmental stimulation in normal animals does not 
      produce significant changes in vermal Purkinje cell dendritic arborization, these 
      cells are vulnerable to early stressful experiences, which is in close 
      association with anxiety-like behaviors.

AB  - Exposure to childhood adversity is associated with increased vulnerability to 
      stress-related disorders in adulthood which has been replicated in rodent stress 
      models, whereas environmental enrichment has been suggested to have beneficial 
      effects. However, the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying these 
      environment influences on adult brain and behavior are not well understood. 
      Therefore, we investigated the long-term effects of maternal separation (MS) or 
      environmental enrichment (EE) in male and female CD1 mice. We found clear 
      sex-specific effects, but limited influence of environmental manipulations, on 
      adult behavior, fecal corticosterone metabolite (FCM) levels and stress- and 
      plasticity related gene expression in discrete brain regions. In detail, adult 
      females displayed higher locomotor activity and FCM levels compared to males and 
      EE resulted in attenuation in both measures, but only in females. There were no 
      sex- or postnatal manipulation-dependent differences in anxiety-related behaviors 
      in either sex. Gene expression analyses revealed that adult males showed higher 
      Fkbp5 mRNA levels in hippocampus, hypothalamus and raphe nuclei, and higher 
      hippocampal Nos1 levels. Interestingly, MS elevated Nos1 levels in hippocampus 
      but reduced Fkbp5 expression in hypothalamus of males. Finally, we also found 
      higher Maoa expression in the hypothalamus of adult females, however no 
      differences were observed in the expression levels of Bdnf, Crhr1, Nr3c1 and 
      Htr1a. Our findings further contribute to sex-dependent differences in behavior, 
      corticosterone and gene expression and reveal that the effects of postnatal 
      manipulations on these parameters in outbred CD1 mice are limited.

TI  - Do positive affectivity and boundary preferences matter for work-family 
      enrichment? A study of human service workers.
PG  - 93-104
LID - 10.1037/a0038165 [doi]
AB  - More individuals than ever are managing work and family roles, but relatively 
      little research has been done exploring whether boundary preferences help 
      individuals benefit from multiple role memberships. Drawing on Greenhaus and 
      Powell's (2006) work-family enrichment theory, along with Boundary Theory 
      (Ashforth, Kreiner, & Fugate, 2000) and Conservation of Resources Theory 
      (Hobfoll, 2002), we explore the impact of personal characteristics as enablers of 
      work-family enrichment, and in turn, work outcomes relevant to human service 
      workers: turnover intentions and emotional exhaustion. In a 2-wave study of 161 
      human service employees, we found that individuals high in positive affectivity 
      were more likely to experience both work-to-family and family to-work enrichment, 
      whereas those with preferences toward integration were more likely to experience 
      work-to-family enrichment (but not family to-work enrichment). In turn, 
      work-to-family enrichment (but not family to-work enrichment) was related to 
      lower turnover intentions and emotional exhaustion. Enrichment served as a 
      mediating mechanism for only some of the hypothesized relationships. Implications 
      for theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) is implicated in the development of stress-related mood 
      disorders in humans. Physical activity reduces the risk of developing 
      stress-related mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. In rats, 6 weeks 
      of wheel running protects against stress-induced behaviors thought to resemble 
      symptoms of human anxiety and depression. The mechanisms by which exercise 
      confers protection against stress-induced behaviors, however, remain unknown. One 
      way by which exercise could generate stress resistance is by producing plastic 
      changes in gene expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The DRN has a high 
      concentration of 5-HT neurons and is implicated in stress-related mood disorders. 
      The goal of the current experiment was to identify changes in the expression of 
      genes that could be novel targets of exercise-induced stress resistance in the 
      DRN. Adult, male F344 rats were allowed voluntary access to running wheels for 6 
      weeks; exposed to inescapable stress or no stress; and sacrificed immediately and 
      2 h after stressor termination. Laser capture micro dissection selectively 
      sampled the DRN. mRNA expression was measured using the whole genome Affymetrix 
      microarray. Comprehensive data analyses of gene expression included differential 
      gene expression, log fold change (LFC) contrast analyses with False Discovery 
      Rate correction, KEGG and Wiki Web Gestalt pathway enrichment analyses, and 
      Weighted Gene Correlational Network Analysis (WGCNA). Our results suggest that 
      physically active rats exposed to stress modulate expression of twice the number 
      of genes, and display a more rapid and strongly coordinated response, than 
      sedentary rats. Bioinformatics analyses revealed several potential targets of 
      stress resistance including genes that are related to immune processes, 
      tryptophan metabolism, and circadian/diurnal rhythms.

TI  - Cholinergic and Dopaminergic Alterations in Nigrostriatal Neurons Are Involved in 
      Environmental Enrichment Motor Protection in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's 
      Disease.
PG  - 453-464
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in 
      the world, being characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration of substantia 
      nigra pars compacta. PD pharmacotherapy has been based on dopamine replacement in 
      the striatum with the dopaminergic precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) 
      and/or with dopaminergic agonists, alongside anticholinergic drugs in order to 
      mitigate the motor abnormalities. However, these practices neither prevent nor 
      stop the progression of the disease. Environmental enrichment (EE) has 
      effectively prevented several neurodegenerative processes, mainly in preclinical 
      trials. Several studies have demonstrated that EE induces biological changes, 
      bearing on cognitive enhancement, neuroprotection, and on the attenuation of the 
      effects of stress, anxiety, and depression. Herein, we investigated whether EE 
      could prevent the motor, biochemical, and molecular abnormalities in a murine 
      model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridine (MPTP). Our results 
      show that EE does not prevent the dopaminergic striatal depletion induced by 
      MPTP, despite having averted the MPTP-induced hyperlocomotion. However, it was 
      able to slow down and avoid, respectively, the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 
      (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) depletion. Analysis of dopaminergic mRNA 
      alterations in the midbrain showed that D1R expression was increased by MPTP, 
      while the normal expression level of this receptor was restored by EE. As for the 
      cholinergic system, MPTP led to a decrease in the ChAT gene expression while 
      increasing the expression of both AChE and M1R. EE attenuated and 
      prevented-respectively-ChAT and M1R gene expression alterations triggered by MPTP 
      in the midbrain. Overall, our data brings new evidence supporting the 
      neuroprotective potential of EE in PD, focusing on the interaction between 
      dopaminergic and cholinergic systems.

TI  - Predatory threat induces huddling in adolescent rats and residual changes in 
      early adulthood suggestive of increased resilience.
PG  - 405-14

AB  - Adolescence is a critical developmental period during which chronic stress and 
      binge alcohol consumption are often seen as environmental risk factors that 
      confer vulnerability to later mental health problems. The current study modelled 
      this using a 2×2 design where male Wistar rats were exposed to intermittent 
      predatory stress (Stress condition: groups of 4 rats given 30 min of cat fur 
      exposure in a large arena, once every 48 h) or intermittent alcohol (Alcohol 
      condition: access to beer for 24 h every 2nd day), or both manipulations given on 
      alternate days (Stress/Alcohol), or no manipulation (Control). The manipulations 
      occurred over a 24 day adolescent window (postnatal day (PND) 33-57) giving a 
      total of 12 cat fur exposures and/or 12 alternate days of beer access. Residual 
      anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours were assessed in early adulthood (PND 
      58-77). Cat fur exposure was found to elicit a distinct defensive response in 
      which groups of adolescent rats huddled together in the corner of the arena, 
      either in "quads" (all 4 rats bunched together) or "triplets" (3 rats together 
      and one outlier rat). Few approaches to the cat fur occurred and locomotor 
      activity was suppressed relative to Control rats placed in the arena without fur. 
      Huddling continued over the 12 repeated exposures to cat fur, and was temporarily 
      exaggerated when fur from a novel cat was introduced. Interestingly, huddling and 
      conditioned fear in the fur-associated context were most pronounced in rats 
      receiving intermittent alcohol, suggesting that alternate day exposure to alcohol 
      had anxiogenic effects, possibly linked to a hangover state on these days. 
      Predatory stress did not affect overall alcohol consumption relative to rats 
      given alcohol alone, but significantly inhibited weight gain through adolescence 
      and into adulthood. In early adulthood, rats exposed to stress in adolescence, 
      regardless of alcohol exposure, showed significantly reduced immobility in the 
      forced swim test and signs of increased sociability with a novel conspecific in a 
      social interaction paradigm. Overall, these findings suggest greater resilience 
      in adulthood after chronic adolescent stress, indicating that coping with 
      predators may be in some ways a form of early environmental enrichment.

AB  - In earlier experiments we have demonstrated that group-housing in a rather 
      impoverished "standard" environment can be a crucial stress factor in male 
      C57Bl/6 mice. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of combining a 
      probable genetic vulnerability--postulated by the "Neurotrophin Hypothesis of 
      Depression"--with the potentially modulating influence of a stressful environment 
      such as "impoverished" standard housing conditions. For that purpose mice with a 
      partial deletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were group-housed 
      under standard and enriched housing conditions and analysed in a well-established 
      test battery for emotional behaviours. Standard group-housing affected emotional 
      behaviour in male and female BDNF heterozygous mice, causing an increase in 
      anxiety, changes in exploration as well as nociception. Providing the animals' 
      cages with supplementary enrichment, however, led to a rescue of emotional 
      alterations, which emphasises the significance of external factors and their 
      relevance for a valid investigation of genetic aspects in these mutants as well 
      as others, which may be examined in terms of stress-responsiveness or 
      emotionality.

TI  - Effects of inducing exercise on growing mice by means of three-dimensional 
      structure in rearing environment.
PG  - 403-411
AB  - We reared ICR mice during a growth period (3 to 10 weeks of age) and examined the 
      effect of exercise induction, by enriching the rearing environment with obstacles 
      such as ladders, compared to the standard environment. Environmental enrichment 
      significantly increased the amount of exercise in both sexes (P<0.01). Enriched 
      exercise mice had higher body weight than control mice at 6 to 9 weeks of age in 
      males and 8 weeks of age in females (P<0.05). The sexual maturation of female 
      enriched exercise mice was significantly advanced compared to the control 
      (P<0.001). Enriched exercise mice showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in the 
      open field test and lower plasma corticosterone levels in both sexes compared to 
      the control, and differences were statistically significant in males (P<0.05). In 
      both sexes, enriched exercise appeared to increase natural killer cells in blood 
      compared to the control, but no statistical differences was detected. In 
      conclusion, we confirmed that daily low-stress exercise could be induced using a 
      three-dimensional rearing environment in growing mice. In addition, we suggest 
      that exercise has beneficial effects on physical growth, sexual maturation and 
      anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, environmental enrichment might be more 
      effective in male than female in group-housed mice.

TI  - The positive aspects of caregiving for cancer patients: a critical review of the 
      literature and directions for future research.
PG  - 2399-407
LID - 10.1002/pon.3311 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although there is a vast body of studies exploring the negative 
      aspects of spousal caregiving for cancer patients, there have also been reports 
      on the positive aspects. The objective of this review was to summarize and 
      appraise the positive aspects of spousal caregiving and to identify directions 
      for future research. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identity 
      articles published in English or Chinese from January 1996 to July 2012. Studies 
      were located using an electronic search, a manual search, and an author search. 
      RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were identified and included in this review. The 
      focus of these studies and their results were described on the basis of the 
      Conceptual Framework of the Positive Aspects of Caregiving. The findings revealed 
      that spousal caregivers for cancer patients experienced various positive aspects 
      of caregiving, such as an enhanced relationship with the care-receiver, the 
      feeling of being rewarded, a sense of personal growth, and a perception of 
      personal satisfaction. Daily enrichment events and self-efficacy on the part of 
      the caregivers were identified as the determining factors in the positive aspects 
      of caregiving. CONCLUSIONS: All of the three domains of the positive aspects of 
      caregiving are interdependent and worked together to contribute to the positive 
      outcomes experienced by spousal caregivers. An intervention program specially 
      designed to enhance the positive aspects of caregiving will support spouses 
      caring for cancer patients.

TI  - Abnormal Expression of MicroRNAs Induced by Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress in 
      Rat Hippocampal Tissues.
PG  - 917-935
LID - 10.1007/s12035-016-0365-6 [doi]
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that the behaviors observed in chronic 
      unpredictable mild stressed (CUMS) rats are similar to the symptoms of depressed 
      patients and that the abnormal expression of cerebral microRNAs is associated 
      with depressive disorder. However, little is known regarding the expression 
      profile of microRNAs induced by CUMS. In this study, we aimed to examine the 
      hippocampal microRNA expression profile in CUMS rats. Forty adolescent male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal and model groups. The rats 
      in the model group were stimulated daily with randomly applied mild stressors 
      from among 14 different mild stressors. The stressors were changed every day and 
      were applied for 35 consecutive days. On the 28th and 35th days after treatment, 
      the weights, physical condition, sucrose preference, and open-field test scores 
      of the rats of the two groups were evaluated. Successful induction of CUMS was 
      considered if the differences of the above metrics between the two groups were 
      statistically significant on the 28th and 35th days after treatment. Cerebral 
      sucrose metabolism images of rats were obtained by 18F-FDG PET/CT. The rats were 
      euthanized under anesthesia, and hippocampal tissues were collected for 
      hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. In addition, the samples were used for microRNA 
      array chip and qRT-PCR analysis. The target genes of different microRNAs were 
      predicted using bioinformatic analysis, and the functions and signal pathways of 
      these target genes were investigated by GO and KEGG analyses. Sixteen rats 
      exhibited successful induction of CUMS. Cerebral (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging showed 
      that the glucose metabolism rate of CUMS rats were significantly lower than 
      normal rats in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CIC, p = 0.022), 
      the retrosplenial agranular area (RSA, p = 0.002), the second sensory cortex (S2, 
      p = 0.028), the first auditory cortex (Au1, p = 0.012), the primary somatosensory 
      cortex, barrel field (SIBF, p = 0.001), and the ventral posteromedial nucleus 
      (VPM) of the right thalamus (p = 0.048). HE staining showed that hippocampal 
      pyramidal cells CUMS rats were thinner, disordered, and exhibited irregular 
      shapes, with many pyknotic cells. The microarray chip and qRT-PCR analysis 
      revealed that five microRNAs were significantly up-regulated [miR-382-3p 
      (p = 0.026), miR-183-5p (p = 0.018), miR-3573-5p (p = 0.042), miR-202-3p 
      (p = 0.016), miR-493-3p (p = 0.009)], and only miR-370-3p was significantly 
      down-regulated (p = 0.036). miRNA target gene prediction and functional 
      annotation analysis showed significant enrichment in several GO terms and 
      pathways associated with depression. Our findings provide supportive evidence for 
      the abnormal expression of multiple CUMS-induced hippocampal microRNAs in rats as 
      well as the involvement of these microRNAs in depressive disorder.

TI  - Enrichment of genetic markers of recent human evolution in educational and 
      cognitive traits.
PG  - 12585

LID - 12585
AB  - Higher cognitive functions are regarded as one of the main distinctive traits of 
      humans. Evidence for the cognitive evolution of human beings is mainly based on 
      fossil records of an expanding cranium and an increasing complexity of material 
      culture artefacts. However, the molecular genetic factors involved in the 
      evolution are still relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated whether genomic 
      regions that underwent positive selection in humans after divergence from 
      Neanderthals are enriched for genetic association with phenotypes related to 
      cognitive functions. We used genome wide association data from a study of college 
      completion (N = 111,114), one of educational attainment (N = 293,623) and two 
      different studies of general cognitive ability (N = 269,867 and 53,949). We found 
      nominally significant polygenic enrichment of associations with college 
      completion (p = 0.025), educational attainment (p = 0.043) and general cognitive 
      ability (p = 0.015 and 0.025, respectively), suggesting that variants influencing 
      these phenotypes are more prevalent in evolutionarily salient regions. The 
      enrichment remained significant after controlling for other known genetic 
      enrichment factors, and for affiliation to genes highly expressed in the brain. 
      These findings support the notion that phenotypes related to higher order 
      cognitive skills typical of humans have a recent genetic component that 
      originated after the separation of the human and Neanderthal lineages.

TI  - Statistical significance of variables driving systematic variation in 
      high-dimensional data.
PG  - 545-54
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu674 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: There are a number of well-established methods such as principal 
      component analysis (PCA) for automatically capturing systematic variation due to 
      latent variables in large-scale genomic data. PCA and related methods may 
      directly provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable 
      that is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model. An unsolved problem in 
      this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are 
      drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (PCs) (and 
      other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the 
      genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance 
      artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting. 
      RESULTS: We introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to 
      accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly 
      associated with any subset or linear combination of PCs. The proposed method can 
      greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered in genomics 
      and can be used to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with 
      latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains 
      accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios. 
      We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the proposed 
      method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell-cycle 
      regulated with an accurate measure of statistical significance. We also analyze 
      gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression data 
      to provide a molecularly driven phenotype. Using our method, we find a greater 
      enrichment for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis 
      that uses a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype. The 
      proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale quantifications of 
      systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: An R software package, called jackstraw, is available in CRAN.

TI  - Purkinje cell dendritic atrophy induced by prenatal stress is mitigated by early 
      environmental enrichment.
PG  - 37-43
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1395344 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal stress (PS) in experimental animals causes long-lasting 
      changes in Purkinje cell dendritic morphology. Furthermore, these structural 
      changes are associated with an increase in anxiogenic behaviors in the elevated 
      plus maze (EPM) and open-field (OF) test. OBJECTIVES: As environmental enrichment 
      (EE) has significant restorative effects on brain neurons and behavior, the aim 
      of this study was to evaluate if postweaning EE mitigates the decrease in 
      Purkinje cell dendritic expansion and exploratory behavior induced by PS in mice. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Restraint stress was induced from gestational day 14 (G14) 
      to G21. Approximately 50% of the PS animals were submitted to the EE paradigm 
      between postnatal days 22 (P22) and P52. At P52 and P82, male animals were 
      behaviorally evaluated, and then the morphology of the cerebellar vermal Purkinje 
      cells was analyzed. RESULTS: We found that EE significantly ameliorates the 
      Purkinje cell dendritic atrophy and anxiety-like behavior in the EPM. CONCLUSION: 
      Our data show that long-lasting Purkinje cell dendritic impairments and 
      anxiety-like behavior can be mitigated by postweaning EE.

TI  - The synergistic anti-depression effects of different efficacy groups of 
      Xiaoyaosan as demonstrated by the integration of network pharmacology and serum 
      metabolomics.

AB  - Compatibility investigations are vital but also the most difficult aspect of 
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions. Previous researches have 
      demonstrated that Xiaoyaosan (XYS) is an effective treatment for depression. 
      However, the compatibility rules of XYS and the underlying mechanisms remain 
      unclear. Herein, we combined network pharmacology and serum metabolomics to 
      investigate the scientific connotations and the compatibility effects of XYS. 
      First, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and the 
      GeneCards databases were applied to identify the chemical components and the 
      putative targets of XYS, and its efficacy groups. We then analyzed the 
      herb-component-target pathways and constructed PPI networks. Potential pathways 
      were determined by gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses. 
      Additionally, a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was applied on 
      rats. A proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry ((1)H NMR) based serum 
      metabolomics was then used to identify potential metabolites and the 
      corresponding pathways that were involved in depression and the potential 
      anti-depression effects of XYS and its efficacy groups. A total of 121 components 
      of XYS and 111 targets were associated with depression. Additionally, we screened 
      105 targets of 24 components in Shugan (SG) group and 106 targets of 95 
      components in Jianpi (JP) group. 13 targets were common to all three groups. 
      Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that Caspase-3 and Nitric 
      oxide synthase-3 were nodes that overlapped with proteins known to be associated 
      with depression. Pathway enrichment analysis further indicated that the putative 
      targets of XYS and its efficacy groups mostly participated in pathways associated 
      with cancer. Also, XYS and its efficacy groups significantly reversed 
      abnormalities of serum metabolites and metabolic pathways, but to different 
      degrees. Overall, different efficacy groups of XYS exhibit synergistic 
      anti-depression effects and contribute to the whole prescription against 
      depression. This study shows that the combination of network pharmacology and 
      metabolomics is an effective approach to demonstrate scientific connotations and 
      compatibility of TCMs from a holistic perspective.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of personal resilience and enrichment programme

      trial.
PG  - 683
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-13-683 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Female sex workers (FSWs) are often considered as the vector, if not 
      reservoir, of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Building upon the 
      existing evidence on the role of psychological health in sexual health, the aim 
      of this protocol is to describe a trial investigating the effectiveness of the 
      Personal Resilience and Enrichment Programme (PREP), a resilience-promoting 
      intervention that targets at psychological well-being i.e. self-esteem, 
      self-efficacy and coping, to facilitate adaptation and ultimately safe sexual 
      practices among FSWs, which could be an innovative strategy in controlling the 
      spread of these infections. METHODS: A total of 132 FSWs will be recruited and 
      randomly assigned to either the intervention or usual care (control) groups in a 
      multi-centred randomised controlled trial. Based on the resilience framework, 
      this intervention is comprised of six weekly sessions focused on the awareness, 
      expression and management of emotions, identifying roles and personal strengths, 
      and effective problem-solving skills. Complex intervention assessment on both 
      intervention process and effectiveness will be adopted when the primary outcome 
      reduction of sexual risk behaviour and other psychological outcomes include their 
      perceived stress, self-esteem, self-efficacy, coping overall resilience, and 
      psychological distress will be measured at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month 
      post-intervention and differences assessed by ANOVA. The relationship of 
      resilience factors, psychological health and HIV preventive behaviours will be 
      evaluated using structural equation modelling. DISCUSSION: It is anticipated that 
      this study will increase our understanding of the relationships between 
      individual resilience attributes, positive adaptation, psychological health and 
      sexual health practices. If successful, this programme will provide an innovative 
      direction for HIV prevention by applying the personal resilience factors to 
      promote both psychological well-being and safe sex for this high risk population.

AB  - Early life experience can significantly determine later mental health status and 
      cognitive function. Neonatal stress, in particular, has been linked to the 
      etiology of mental health disorders as divergent as mood disorder, schizophrenia, 
      and autism. Our study uses a Balb/CByJ mouse model to test the hypothesis, that 
      neonatal stress will alter development and subsequent environmental modulation of 
      neocortex. Using a split litter design, we generated stressed mice (STR) and 
      within litter controls (LMC) along with age-matched, untreated animals (AMC), to 
      serve as across litter controls. Short, daily exposure to a psychosocial/physical 
      stressor, during the first week of life, resulted by adulthood in significant 
      changes in neocortical thickness and architecture, which were further modulated 
      by exposure to behavioral testing. Surprisingly, cortical size in LMC mice was 
      also affected. These observations were compared to the effects of environmental 
      enrichment in the same mouse strain. Our data indicate that LMC and STR males 
      share with environmentally enriched males, an increase in thickness in 
      infra-granular cortical layers, while STR also display a stress selective 
      decrease in supragranular layers, in response to behavioral training as adults.

TI  - Differential effects of early environmental enrichment on emotionality related 
      behaviours in Huntington's disease transgenic mice.
PG  - 41-55

AB  - Psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety are reported in patients 
      with Huntington's disease (HD). Recent studies suggest beneficial effects of 
      environmental enrichment (EE) on HD progression possibly through the serotonergic 
      system. We investigated the potential effectiveness of EE in correcting the 
      affective-like phenotype of female R6/1 HD mice. In addition to a behavioural 
      battery of tests assessing depression and anxiety-related endophenotypes, we 
      recorded physiological measures, including body temperature regulation and 
      defecation rate as indices of stress reactivity. Finally, following 
      identification of changes in serotonin (5-HT) receptor gene expression we 
      measured the function of 5-HT(1A) auto- and hetero-receptors. We found that 
      8-week-old female HD mice exhibited higher immobility time in the forced swimming 
      test and a decreased preference for saccharin solution. EE did not correct those 
      depressive-like behaviours but reduced anxiety-related measures in unconditioned 
      approach/avoidance conflict situations. Defecation rate in a large open field and 
      change in temperature during exposure to the tail suspension test were both 
      enhanced in HD compared to wild-type animals. Despite the enhanced hypothermic 
      response to the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT exhibited by HD mice, we 
      found a reduction in 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated stimulation of [(35)S]GTP-γ-S 
      binding in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the hippocampus of HD animals. EE did not 
      change 5-HT(1A) receptor function. Our data suggest that early EE has beneficial 
      effects on the anxiety-like, but not on depression-like, behaviours in HD. This 
      is the first evidence that these affective endophenotypes can be dissociated via 
      this form of environmental stimulation. As 5-HT(1A) receptor dysfunction was not 
      affected by EE, this receptor is unlikely to underlie the anxiety-related 
      phenotype of HD. However, the specific regulatory role of the 5-HT(1A) 
      autoreceptor in mediating depressive-like behaviour in HD remains to be 
      elucidated. Interestingly, by comparing in vivo and in vitro results, our 
      findings suggest that 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia could be mediated by other 
      targets besides the 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor, including hippocampal 5-HT(7) 
      receptors.

TI  - Genes known to escape X chromosome inactivation predict co-morbid chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain and posttraumatic stress symptom development in women 
      following trauma exposure.
PG  - 415-427
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32706 [doi]
AB  - Co-morbid chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) and posttraumatic stress symptoms 
      (PTSS) are frequent sequelae of motor vehicle collision, are associated with 
      greater disability than either outcome alone, and are more prevalent in women 
      than men. In the current study we assessed for evidence that gene transcripts 
      originating from the X chromosome contribute to sex differences in vulnerability 
      to CMSP and PTSS after motor vehicle collision. Nested samples were drawn from a 
      longitudinal study of African American individuals, and CMSP (0-10 numeric rating 
      scale) and PTSS (impact of events scale, revised) outcomes were assessed 6 months 
      following motor vehicle collision. Blood RNA were sequenced (n = 101) and the 
      relationship between X chromosome mRNA expression levels and co-morbid CMSP and 
      PTSS outcomes was evaluated using logistic regression analyses. A 
      disproportionate number of peritraumatic X chromosome mRNA predicting CMSP and 
      PTSS in women were genes previously found to escape X chromosome inactivation 
      (11/40, z = -2.9, p = .004). Secondary analyses assessing gene ontology 
      relationships between these genes identified an enrichment in genes known to 
      influence neuronal plasticity. Further, the relationship of expression of two 
      critical regulators of X chromosome inactivation, X-inactive specific transcript 
      (XIST) and Yin Yang 1 (YY1), was different in women developing CMSP and PTSS. 
      Together, these data suggest that X chromosome genes that escape inactivation may 
      contribute to sex differences in vulnerability to CMSP and PTSS after motor 
      vehicle collision.

TI  - Providing live black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) improves welfare 
      while maintaining performance of piglets post-weaning.

AB  - During weaning, piglets experience concurrent social, physical, and nutritional 
      stressors. Consequently, piglets often have poor feed intake and display 
      increased oral manipulative behaviours post-weaning, indicative of compromised 
      welfare. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) possess many attractive properties for 
      pigs and could therefore function as effective edible enrichment, potentially 
      alleviating weaning stress by facilitating exploration and promoting feed intake. 
      In this study, pairs of piglets received a small amount of either live BSFL or 
      wood shavings (8 pens/treatment) scattered throughout the pen twice a day for 
      11 days after weaning. Home-pen behaviour was scored by instantaneous scan 
      sampling on day 2, 5 and 8, and behavioural responses to a novel environment and 
      novel object were scored on day 10/11. Performance-related parameters were 
      observed regularly. Larvae provisioning increased floor-directed exploration and 
      decreased object-directed exploration, pig-directed oral manipulation, fighting 
      and eating of pellets, and reduced neophobia towards a novel object. Pellet 
      intake was significantly decreased by BSFL provisioning during day 4-11 
      post-weaning, although feed and net energy intake including BSFL never differed 
      between treatments. BSFL provisioning did not influence piglet growth, feed 
      efficiency, energy efficiency, and faecal consistency. To conclude, live BSFL 
      provisioning positively affected post-weaning piglet behaviour while maintaining 
      performance.

TI  - Sexuality in the shadows of a friendship: An intimate portrayal of friendship 
      between two British Pakistani lesbians.
PG  - 43-53
LID - 10.1080/10894160.2017.1303284 [doi]
AB  - Friendships have the potential to transform and reconfigure lives and improve 
      one's health and mental well-being through mutual affection, understanding, care, 
      and love. The social, cultural, and religious ostracism British Pakistani 
      lesbians encounter in their lives means that their friendships, in particular 
      with other lesbians, are crucial for fostering a sense of self-acceptance and 
      personal enrichment. Friendship can provide a supportive network, refuge, and 
      respite from a repressive social, cultural, and family environment, especially 
      for those who feel ostracized and marginalized. Based on in-depth, 
      semi-structured interviews with two British Pakistani lesbian friends, the study 
      investigates the relationship between friendship and sexual identity, exploring 
      how each friend negotiated her own sexual identity in the context of the 
      friendship and whether the friendship itself served as a catalyst for 
      self-acceptance. The case study offers an intriguing account of the importance of 
      friendship and the role it plays in mitigating the isolation and disconnectedness 
      caused by societal homophobia.

AB  - Prospective epidemiological studies found that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 
      can impair immune function and increase risk for cardiovascular disease or 
      events. Mechanisms underlying the physiological reverberations of anxiety, 
      however, are still elusive. Hence, we aimed to investigate molecular processes 
      mediating effects of anxiety on physical health using blood gene expression 
      profiles of 336 community participants (157 anxious and 179 control). We examined 
      genome-wide differential gene expression in anxiety, as well as associations 
      between nine major modules of co-regulated transcripts in blood gene expression 
      and anxiety. No significant differential expression was observed in women, but 
      631 genes were differentially expressed between anxious and control men at the 
      false discovery rate of 0.1 after controlling for age, body mass index, race, and 
      batch effect. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that genes with 
      altered expression levels in anxious men were involved in response of various 
      immune cells to vaccination and to acute viral and bacterial infection, and in a 
      metabolic network affecting traits of metabolic syndrome. Further, we found one 
      set of 260 co-regulated genes to be significantly associated with anxiety in men 
      after controlling for the relevant covariates, and demonstrate its equivalence to 
      a component of the stress-related conserved transcriptional response to adversity 
      profile. Taken together, our results suggest potential molecular pathways that 
      can explain negative effects of GAD observed in epidemiological studies. 
      Remarkably, even mild anxiety, which most of our participants had, was associated 
      with observable changes in immune-related gene expression levels. Our findings 
      generate hypotheses and provide incremental insights into molecular mechanisms 
      mediating negative physiological effects of GAD.

TI  - The Effect of Long-Term Environmental Enrichment in Chronic Cerebral 
      Hypoperfusion-Induced Memory Impairment in Rats.
PG  - 278-286

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia. It occurs 
      when the cerebral blood supply is reduced by disarrangement of the circulatory 
      system. Environmental enrichment (EE) has been associated with cognitive 
      improvement, motor function recovery, and anxiety relief with respect to various 
      neurodegenerative diseases and emotional stress models. The purpose of this study 
      was to determine whether long-term EE influenced cognitive impairment in a rat 
      model of chronic hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common 
      carotid arteries (BCCAo). The Y-maze and Morris water maze tests were performed 
      to evaluate the rats' cognitive functions. Also, the protein expression of 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated cAMP-calcium response 
      element binding protein (pCREB), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      were confirmed by Western blot. The microvessels and angiogenesis-associated 
      proteins in the hippocampal region were investigated using immunohistochemistry. 
      The VaD + EE group showed significantly better cognitive functions than the VaD 
      group in both the Y-maze and MWM tests. In addition, the VaD + EE group showed 
      significantly increased expression of BDNF, pCREB, and VEGF in the hippocampus 
      compared to the VaD group. Rats in the VaD + EE group also had increased length 
      of microvessels and VEGF expression in the hippocampus. These results suggest 
      that long-term EE exerts neuroprotective effects against cognitive impairment 
      induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion through the enhancement of BDNF, pCREB, 
      and VEGF expression and indicate that EE may be a good nursing intervention in 
      vascular dementia patients.

TI  - Influence of omega-3 fatty acid status on the way rats adapt to chronic restraint 
      stress.

AB  - Omega-3 fatty acids are important for several neuronal and cognitive functions. 
      Altered omega-3 fatty acid status has been implicated in reduced resistance to 
      stress and mood disorders. We therefore evaluated the effects of repeated 
      restraint stress (6 h/day for 21 days) on adult rats fed omega-3 deficient, 
      control or omega-3 enriched diets from conception. We measured body weight, 
      plasma corticosterone and hippocampus glucocorticoid receptors and correlated 
      these data with emotional and depression-like behaviour assessed by their 
      open-field (OF) activity, anxiety in the elevated-plus maze (EPM), the sucrose 
      preference test and the startle response. We also determined their plasma and 
      brain membrane lipid profiles by gas chromatography. Repeated restraint stress 
      caused rats fed a control diet to lose weight. Their plasma corticosterone 
      increased and they showed moderate behavioural changes, with increases only in 
      grooming (OF test) and entries into the open arms (EPM). Rats fed the omega-3 
      enriched diet had a lower stress-induced weight loss and plasma corticosterone 
      peak, and reduced grooming. Rats chronically lacking omega-3 fatty acid exhibited 
      an increased startle response, a stress-induced decrease in locomotor activity 
      and exaggerated grooming. The brain omega-3 fatty acids increased as the dietary 
      omega-3 fatty acids increased; diets containing preformed long-chain omega-3 
      fatty acid were better than diets containing the precursor alpha-linolenic acid. 
      However, the restraint stress reduced the amounts of omega-3 incorporated. These 
      data showed that the response to chronic restraint stress was modulated by the 
      omega-3 fatty acid supply, a dietary deficiency was deleterious while enrichment 
      protecting against stress.

AB  - Animals with low and high immobility in the forced swimming test (FST) differ in 
      a number of neurobehavioral factors. A growing body of evidence suggests that the 
      exposure to enriched environments mediates a number of changes in the brain. 
      Therefore, we studied if animals' individuality can somehow modulate the response 
      to environmental stimuli. Male rats were classified according to their immobility 
      time scores in the FST test session as animals with low, medium or high 
      immobility. Then, rats from groups with low and high immobility were randomly 
      distributed in two groups to be reared in different housing conditions (i.e., 
      enriched and standard conditions) during 8weeks. Animals were subjected to the 
      open field test (OFT) before and 6weeks after the start of housing protocol. Rats 
      with high immobility in the FST also showed high ambulation and high rearing time 
      in the first OFT. Such findings were not observed in the second OFT. Conversely, 
      an effect of environmental enrichment was found in the second OFT where enriched 
      animals showed lower ambulation and higher grooming time than the standard 
      control group. Rats were sacrificed after the housing protocol and neurochemical 
      content and/or gene expression were studied in three different brain regions: the 
      prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens. Rats with low 
      immobility showed significantly higher accumbal 5-HT levels than animals with 
      high immobility, whereas no neurochemical differences were observed between 
      enriched and standard animals. Regarding expression data, however, an effect of 
      enrichment on accumbal corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its receptor 1 
      (CRFR1) levels was observed, and such effect depended on immobility levels. Thus, 
      our results not only allowed us to identify a number of differences between 
      animals with low and high immobility or animals housed in standard and enriched 
      conditions, but also suggested that animals' individuality modulated in some way 
      the response to environmental stimuli.

TI  - The Effects of Predictability in Daily Husbandry Routines on Captive Rhesus 
      Macaques (Macaca mulatta).
PG  - 117-127
AB  - Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) housed indoors experience many routine husbandry 
      activities on a daily basis. The anticipation of these events can lead to stress, 
      regardless of whether the events themselves are positive or aversive in nature. 
      The specific goal of this study was to identify whether increasing the 
      predictability of husbandry events could decrease stress and anxiety in captive 
      rhesus macaques. This study was conducted on 39 single-housed subjects in four 
      indoor rooms at the Oregon National Primate Research Center. Temporal and 
      signaled predictability were added to four daily husbandry events: morning and 
      afternoon feeding, enrichment distribution, and room cleaning. Temporally 
      predictable husbandry events occurred reliably at the same time daily, while 
      signaled predictable husbandry events were preceded by a distinct event-specific 
      signal in the form of a doorbell. Informal tests prior to study onset found the 
      doorbells not to be aversive to the subjects. Subjects received each of four 
      treatments: unpredictable events, temporally predictable events, signaled 
      predictable events, and temporally and signaled predictable events. Change in 
      stress was evaluated by monitoring changes in motor stereotypies and displacement 
      behaviors. Our results showed that subjects displayed less stress and 
      anticipatory behaviors related to feeding and enrichment events when the events 
      were temporally predictable (P < 0 .0001). When husbandry events were preceded by 
      a reliable signal, subjects vocalized less prior to the event and were less 
      responsive to activity outside of the room (P < 0 .01). However this may have 
      come at a cost as the animals were extremely reactive to the doorbell signals and 
      showed a heightened stress response during the actual husbandry events (P < 0 
      .01). Similar to temporal predictability alone, when temporal predictability was 
      combined with signaled predictability subjects displayed less stress and 
      anticipatory behaviors related to feeding and enrichment events (P < 0 .0001). In 
      addition, when both forms of predictability were combined subjects showed less 
      stress behaviors while waiting for daily room cleaning (P < 0 .01). When signaled 
      predictability was paired with temporal predictability subjects no longer had the 
      negative response to the doorbell signal, as they were able to predict and 
      anticipate when the events would occur. Because these results are not necessarily 
      applicable to animals that are given control over their environment or housed in 
      a group setting, the management recommendation that can be made from this study 
      is that temporal predictability of feeding reduces stress and anxiety and is thus 
      beneficial to captive indoor single-housed rhesus macaques.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Kai Yu Zhong Yu recipe (KYZY) is a classic 
      herbal formula in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has been used to treat 
      infertility associated with psychological stress for more than three hundred 
      years. AIM OF THE STUDY: Psychological stress has major impacts on fertility, 
      with variable outcomes depending on the nature, strength, and duration of the 
      stress. Stress can directly disturb ovulation, oocyte quality, maturation, and 
      embryo development. The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular 
      mechanism by which KYZY improves oocyte developmental potential under 
      psychological stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ICR female mice aged 4-5 weeks were 
      randomly divided into five groups: control, stressed in the chronic unpredictable 
      stress model (CUSM), and stressed plus KYZY treatment at 38.2 g/kg (KYZYH), 
      19.1 g/kg (KYZYM), or 9.6 g/kg (KYZYL). Ovary function was assessed by measuring 
      serum levels of estradiol (E2), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating 
      hormone (FSH), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Oocyte quality was evaluated in 
      terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and 
      mitochondria distribution. We used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to identify 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups and then further analyzed 
      the DEGs for gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and protein-protein interactions. 
      RESULTS: Mice in the stressed group had reduced serum E2, LH, and FSH as well as 
      increased ROS levels, increased apoptosis, and disturbed mitochondria 
      distribution in oocytes. Treatment with KYZY at all three doses reversed or 
      ameliorated these negative effects of stress. DEG analysis identified 187 common 
      genes between the two comparisons (stressed vs. control and KYZYM vs. stressed), 
      33 of which were annotated with six gene ontology (GO)'s biological process (BP) 
      terms: cell differentiation, apoptosis, ATP synthesis, protein 
      homo-oligomerization, neuron migration, and negative regulation of peptidase 
      activity. Protein-protein interaction network analysis of DEGs identified key hub 
      genes. Notably, the genes Atp5o and Cyc1 were both involved in the ATP synthesis 
      and among the top three hub genes, suggesting that regulation of oocyte 
      mitochondrial electron transport and ATP synthesis is important in the response 
      to stress and also is a possible mechanism of action for KYZY. CONCLUSIONS: KYZY 
      was effective in ameliorating the adverse effects of stress on oocyte competence, 
      possibly by targeting the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthase.

TI  - Consequences of early life stress on genomic landscape of H3K4me3 in prefrontal

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal separation models in rodents are widely used to establish 
      molecular mechanisms underlying prolonged effects of early life adversity on 
      neurobiological and behavioral outcomes in adulthood. However, global epigenetic 
      signatures following early life stress in these models remain unclear. RESULTS: 
      In this study, we carried out a ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4 trimethylation profile 
      in the prefrontal cortex of adult male mice with a history of early life stress. 
      Two types of stress were used: prolonged separation of pups from their mothers 
      (for 3 h once a day, maternal separation, MS) and brief separation (for 15 min 
      once a day, handling, HD). Adult offspring in the MS group demonstrated reduced 
      locomotor activity in the open field test accompanied by reduced exploratory 
      activity, while the HD group showed decreased anxiety-like behavior only. In a 
      group of maternal separation, we have found a small number (45) of slightly 
      up-regulated peaks, corresponding to promoters of 70 genes, while no changes were 
      observed in a group of handling. Among the genes whose promoters have 
      differential enrichment of H3K4me3, the most relevant ones participate in gene 
      expression regulation, modulation of chromatin structure and mRNA processing. For 
      two genes, Ddias and Pip4k2a, increased H3K4me3 levels were associated with the 
      increased mRNA expression in MS group. CONCLUSION: The distribution of H3K4me3 in 
      prefrontal cortex showed relatively low variability across all individuals, and 
      only some subtle changes were revealed in mice with a history of early life 
      stress. It is possible that the observed long-lasting behavioral alterations 
      induced by maternal separation are mediated by other epigenetic mechanisms, or 
      other brain structures are responsible for these effects.

TI  - Serotonin depletion causes valproate-responsive manic-like condition and 
      increased hippocampal neuroplasticity that are reversed by stress.

AB  - Abnormal hippocampal neural plasticity has been implicated in behavioural 
      abnormalities and complex neuropsychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder 
      (BD). However, the determinants of this neural alteration remain unknown. This 
      work tests the hypothesis that the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is a key 
      determinant of hippocampal neuroplasticity, and its absence leads to maladaptive 
      behaviour relevant for BD. Depletion of brain 5-HT in Tph2 mutant mice resulted 
      in reduced behavioural despair, reduced anxiety, marked aggression and lower 
      habituation in novel environments, reminiscent of bipolar-associated manic 
      behaviour. Treatment with valproate produced a substantial improvement of the 
      mania-like behavioural phenotypes displayed by Tph2 mutants. Brain-wide fMRI 
      mapping in mutants revealed functional hippocampal hyperactivity in which we also 
      observed dramatically increased neuroplasticity. Importantly, remarkable 
      correspondence between the transcriptomic profile of the Tph2 mutant hippocampus 
      and neurons from bipolar disorder patients was observed. Chronic stress reversed 
      the emotional phenotype and the hippocampal transcriptional landscape of Tph2 
      mutants. These changes were associated with inappropriate activation of 
      transcriptional adaptive response to stress as assessed by gene set enrichment 
      analyses in the hippocampus of Tph2 mutant mice. These findings delineate 5-HT as 
      a critical determinant in BD associated maladaptive emotional responses and 
      aberrant hippocampal neuroplasticity, and support the use of Tph2-/- mice as a 
      new research tool for mechanistic and therapeutic research in bipolar disorder.

AB  - Chronic and severe stress exposure in early childhood is associated with the 
      development of psychiatric disorders. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      this relationship remain poorly understood. Here, we profile molecular marks (DNA 
      methylation and gene expression) throughout the human genome to determine the 
      associations between childhood stress exposure and gene regulation. To do so, we 
      collected saliva tissue from prepubertal girls (mean age 10.9 ± 1.26 years) who 
      had experienced different levels of childhood adversity, ranging from mild to 
      severe. We found 122 differentially methylated genes (FDR P-value < 0.05) 
      associated with high childhood stress exposures that affect brain development. Of 
      these differentially methylated genes, 12 also differed in gene expression. To 
      further investigate the potential effects of stress exposure on gene regulation, 
      we examined the DNA sequences flanking all the differentially methylated loci. 
      This analysis revealed enrichment of known binding sites for transcription 
      factors, suggesting that DNA methylation may regulate gene expression by 
      mediating transcription factor binding on these genes. Together, these findings 
      indicate a possible neuromolecular mechanism linking children's social 
      experiences with risk for anxiety and depressive disorders.

AB  - Touchscreen-based procedures are increasingly used in experimental animal 
      research. They not only represent a promising approach for translational 
      research, but have also been highlighted as a powerful tool to reduce potential 
      experimenter effects in animal studies. However, to prepare the animals for a 
      touchscreen-based test, an often time-consuming training phase is required that 
      has itself been shown to cause increased adrenocortical activity and anxiety-like 
      behavior in mice. While these findings point at a potentially negative effect of 
      touchscreen training at first glance, results have also been discussed in light 
      of an enriching effect of touchscreen training. The aim of the present study was 
      therefore to shed more light on recently reported touchscreen training effects, 
      with a particular focus on the termination of the training routine. Specifically, 
      we investigated whether the termination of regular touchscreen training could 
      constitute a loss of enrichment for mice. Thus, we assessed fecal corticosterone 
      metabolites (FCMs), exploratory-, anxiety-like and home cage behavior in 
      touchscreen-trained mice in comparison to food restricted and ad libitum fed 
      mice, as a restricted diet is an integral part of the training process. 
      Furthermore, we compared these parameters between mice that were continuously 
      trained and mice whose training was terminated 2 weeks earlier. Our results 
      confirm previous findings showing that a mild food restriction increases the 
      animals' exploratory behavior and shifts their activity rhythm. Moreover, 
      touchscreen training was found to increase FCM levels and anxiety-like behavior 
      of the mice. However, no effect of the termination of touchscreen training could 
      be detected, a finding which contradicts the enrichment loss hypothesis. 
      Therefore, we discuss two alternative explanations for the findings. Yet, the 
      current state of knowledge is not sufficient to draw final conclusions at this 
      stage. In compliance with the refinement endeavors for laboratory animals, 
      further research should assess the severity of touchscreen procedures to ensure a 
      responsible and well-founded use of animals for experimental purposes.

      predictors and implications using latent transition analysis.

AB  - Employees around the world have experienced sudden, significant changes in their 
      work and family roles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, applied 
      psychologists have limited understanding of how employee experiences of 
      work-family conflict and enrichment have been affected by this event and what 
      organizations can do to ensure better employee functioning during such societal 
      crises. Adopting a person-centered approach, we examine transitions in employees' 
      work-family interfaces from before COVID-19 to after its onset. First, in Study 
      1, using latent profile analysis (N = 379; nonpandemic data), we identify 
      profiles of bidirectional conflict and enrichment, including beneficial (low 
      conflict and high enrichment), active (medium conflict and enrichment), and 
      passive (low conflict and enrichment). In Study 2, with data collected before and 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic, we replicate Study 1 profiles and explore whether 
      employees transition between work-family profiles during the pandemic. Results 
      suggest that although many remain in prepandemic profiles, positive (from 
      active/passive to beneficial) and negative (from beneficial to active/passive) 
      transitions occurred for a meaningful proportion of respondents. People were more 
      likely to go through negative transitions if they had high segmentation 
      preferences, engaged in emotion-focused coping, experienced higher technostress, 
      and had less compassionate supervisors. In turn, negative transitions were 
      associated with negative employee consequences during the pandemic (e.g., lower 
      job satisfaction and job performance, and higher turnover intent). We discuss 
      implications for future research and for managing during societal crises, both 
      present and future. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Early life stress alters adult serotonin 2C receptor pre-mRNA editing and 
      expression of the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein G q.
PG  - 1467-73
AB  - Infant maternal separation, a paradigm of early life stress in rodents, elicits 
      long-lasting changes in gene expression that persist into adulthood. In BALB/c 
      mice, an inbred strain with spontaneously elevated anxiety and stress reactivity, 
      infant maternal separation led to increased depression-like behavioral responses 
      to adult stress and robustly increased editing of serotonin 2C receptor pre-mRNA. 
      Chronic fluoxetine treatment of adult BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress 
      affected neither their behavioral responses to stress nor their basal 5-HT2C 
      pre-mRNA editing phenotype. However, when fluoxetine was administered during 
      adolescence, depression-like behavioral responses to stress were significantly 
      diminished in these mice, and their basal and stress-induced 5-HT2C pre-mRNA 
      editing phenotypes were significantly lower. Moreover, when BALB/c mice exposed 
      to early life stress were raised in an enriched postweaning environment, their 
      depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress were also significantly 
      diminished. However, their 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing phenotype remained unaltered. 
      Hence, the similar behavioral effects of enrichment and fluoxetine treatment 
      during adolescence were not accompanied by similar changes in 5-HT2C pre-mRNA 
      editing. Enriched and nonenriched BALB/c mice exposed to early life stress also 
      exhibited significantly increased expression of mRNA and protein encoding the G 
      alpha q subunit of G-protein that couples to 5-HT2A/2C receptors. In contrast, G 
      alpha q expression levels were significantly lower in fluoxetine-treated mice. 
      These findings suggest that compensatory changes in G alpha q expression occur in 
      mice with persistently altered 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing and provide an explanation 
      for the dissociation between 5-HT2C receptor editing phenotypes and behavioral 
      stress responses.

TI  - Emotional Demands at Work and the Risk of Clinical Depression: A Longitudinal 
      Study in the Danish Public Sector.
PG  - 994-1001
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is a 2-year follow-up study of different dimensions of 
      work-related emotional demands as a predictor for clinical depression. METHODS: 
      In a two-wave study, 3224 (72%) public employees from 474 work-units participated 
      twice by filling in questionnaires. Sixty-two cases of clinical depression were 
      diagnosed. Emotional demands were examined as perceived and content-related 
      emotional demands, individually reported and work-unit based. Support, meaningful 
      work, and enrichment were considered as potential effect modifiers. RESULTS: 
      Individually reported perceived emotional demands predicted depression (odds 
      ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence intervals: 1.02 to 1.92). The work-unit based odds 
      ratio was in the same direction, though not significant. Content-related 
      emotional demands did not predict depression. Support, meaningful work, and 
      enrichment did not modify the results. CONCLUSIONS: The personal perception of 
      emotional demands was a risk factor for clinical depression but specific 
      emotionally demanding work tasks were not.

AB  - Early social isolation (SI) produces a variety of emotional, behavioral and 
      cognitive abnormalities. Conversely, environmental enrichment (EE), a complicated 
      social and physical construct, offers beneficial effects on brain plasticity and 
      development. However, whether or not exclusive physical EE is sufficient to 
      reverse the adverse consequences of early SI remains unclear. Here we reported 
      that 1month-old solitary mice housed in the EE for 8weeks corrected spatial 
      cognitive dysfunction, but did not ameliorate social interaction deficits and 
      increased anxiety-like behavior. Pathological analyses revealed that the enriched 
      environment decreased cellular apoptosis, synaptic protein loss, myelination 
      defect and microglial activation in the hippocampus, but not medial prefrontal 
      cortex (mPFC) of mice housed singly. Moreover, increased nuclear factor-kappaB 
      and interleukin-1β levels, and downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor signaling pathway were normalized in the hippocampus rather than mPFC of 
      these animals. Our results revealed a brain region-specific effectiveness of 
      physical EE in remediating brain impairment of adolescent SI mice, with a 
      complete reversal of hippocampus-dependent cognitive dysfunctions, but without 
      mitigation of mPFC associated anxiety and social interaction defects. This 
      finding emphasizes the irreplaceable role of social life for the early brain 
      development.

TI  - Early environmental experience alters baseline and ethanol-induced cognitive 
      impulsivity: relationship to forebrain 5-HT1A receptor binding.
PG  - 207-20
AB  - The relationship between impulsivity and drug abuse is poorly understood despite 
      evidence that impulsive behaviour both predicts, and is a consequence of, drug 
      use. Moreover, although there are clear individual differences in the propensity 
      to addiction, this relationship has not been investigated with respect to 
      impulsive behaviour. We tested whether early environmental experience would 
      influence behavioural measures of impulsivity, and further, whether this 
      experience would alter impulsive choice following ethanol intoxication. 
      Thirty-six male, Long-Evans rats were reared in either isolated (1 rat/cage), 
      standard (2 rats/cage), or enriched (group housed with toys) conditions. After a 
      3-month rearing period, animals were tested in two operant tasks measuring either 
      motor (go/no-go) or cognitive (delay-to-reinforcement) impulsivity. Rats were 
      then re-tested following 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 g/kg ethanol. Forebrain 5-HT1A 
      binding was assessed post-mortem using in vitro receptor autoradiography with the 
      agonist [3H]8-OH-DPAT (3H-8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetralin). Rearing 
      condition did not influence baseline motor impulsivity, but isolation rearing led 
      to decreased baseline cognitive impulsivity. Ethanol did not affect motor 
      impulsivity, but dose-dependently increased impulsive choice in the 
      delay-to-reinforcement task. Enriched rats were more impulsive overall, and 
      isolation-reared rats only showed a shift in impulsive behaviour after 1.2 g/kg. 
      Isolation rearing decreased, and enrichment rearing increased 5-HT1A binding in 
      the frontal pole of the cortex following experience in the delay-to-reinforcement 
      task. Isolation-reared rats also showed a significant decrease in 5-HT1A binding 
      in the dentate gyrus of the ventral hippocampus following experience in the 
      delay-to-reinforcement relative to the go/no-go task. These data indicate that 
      differential rearing has a significant influence on cognitive impulsivity, and 
      that altered serotonergic function may underlie these differences.

TI  - Behavioral, cognitive and biochemical responses to different environmental 
      conditions in male Ts65Dn mice, a model of Down syndrome.
PG  - 174-85
AB  - Ts65Dn mouse is the most widely accepted model for Down syndrome. We previously 
      showed that environmental enrichment improved spatial learning in female but 
      deteriorated it in male Ts65Dn mice. This study analyzed the factors contributing 
      to the disturbed cognition of male Ts65Dn mice after enriched housing, by 
      allocating male control and Ts65Dn mice in four conditions after weaning: small 
      (n = 2-3) and large group (n = 8-10) housing, and enriched housing in small (2-3) 
      and large groups (8-10). Learning, aggressive behavior, anxiety-like behavior and 
      biochemical correlates of stress were evaluated when Ts65Dn and control mice were 
      4-5 months old. Environmental enrichment in large mixed colonies of Ts65Dn and 
      diploid littermates disturbed behavioral and learning skills of Ts65Dn mice in 
      the Morris water maze. ACTH and testosterone levels were not modified in any 
      group of mice. Ts65Dn and control mice subjected to enriched housing in large 
      groups and Ts65Dn mice housed in large groups showed higher corticosterone 
      levels. Aggressive behavior was evaluated by measuring the number of attacks 
      performed in the presence of an intruder. Ts65Dn mice performed less attacks than 
      controls in all conditions, especially after enriched housing, indicating 
      subordination. In the plus maze, cognitive aspects (i.e. risk assessment) and 
      motor components (open arm avoidance) of anxiety behavior were evaluated; no 
      difference in any condition was found. It is suggested that an excess of social 
      and/or physical stimulation in Ts65Dn mice may affect cognition by disturbing the 
      emotional and behavioral components of the learning process.

TI  - Quantitative proteomic analysis of the liver reveals antidepressant potential 
      protein targets of Sinisan in a mouse CUMS model of depression.

AB  - In traditional Chinese medicine, the role of the liver in depression is highly 
      valued, and liver-relieving drugs, such as Sinisan, are often used to treat 
      depression; however, the mechanism whereby these drugs work remains unclear. The 
      present study aimed to reveal possible antidepressant mechanisms of Sinisan (SNS) 
      by analyzing hepatic proteomics in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice. 
      Using the CUMS mouse model of depression, the antidepressant effects of SNS were 
      assessed by the sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST). 
      Hepatic differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) after SNS treatment were 
      investigated by tandem mass tag (TMT) based quantitative proteomics analysis. 
      Then, a bioinformatics analysis of DEPs was conducted through hierarchical 
      clustering, Venn analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation enrichment, and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. DEP genes were 
      further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
      analysis and western blotting. Behavioral results demonstrated that SNS 
      significantly increased sucrose intake in SPT and shortened the immobility time 
      in FST in model mice. Eighty-two DEPs were identified, including 37 upregulated 
      and 45 downregulated proteins, between model and SNS groups. Enrichment analysis 
      of GO annotations indicated that SNS primarily maintained cellular iron ion 
      homeostasis by iron ion transportation and regulated expression of some 
      extracellular structural proteins for oxidation-reduction processes. KEGG and 
      Venn analysis showed that mineral absorption, steroid hormone biosynthesis and 
      metabolism might be the principal pathways through which SNS acts on depression. 
      Furthermore, several proteins involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of 
      steroid hormone pathways were significantly up/downregulated by SNS, including 
      CYP2B19, CYP7B1 (validated by qRT-PCR) and HSD3b5 (validated by qRT-PCR and 
      western blotting). Our results indicate that SNS plays important roles in 
      antidepressant actions by restoring DEPs, resulting in the biosynthesis and 
      metabolism of steroid hormones. The current results provide novel perspectives 
      for revealing potential protein targets of SNS in depression.

AB  - The present study explores the impact of acculturation on health status and use 
      of health and community aged care services among elderly Iranian-born immigrants 
      to Australia. Three hundred two Iranian immigrants aged 65 years and over who had 
      lived in the Sydney Metropolitan area for at least six months participated. Data 
      were collected using a written survey instrument, face-to-face interviews, and 
      telephone interviews. Iranian immigrants had higher levels of psychological 
      distress, more limited physical function, greater need for help or assistance 
      with activities of daily living, lower feelings of wellbeing, and were much less 
      likely to use aged care services than the general population of older 
      Australians. Participants who did not speak English at home were more likely to 
      experience psychological distress and had greater limitations in their physical 
      functioning. Elderly Iranians with better English proficiency had lower levels of 
      anxiety and depressive symptoms and reported less need for help and supervision 
      in activities of daily living; they were also more likely to access health care 
      services. Elderly Iranian immigrants experience higher levels of psychological 
      distress and lower levels of physical function than the general population of 
      older Australians; those with limited proficiency in English are at greatest 
      risk. These findings contribute to the enrichment of multicultural policy, social 
      fairness, access, and equity for ethnic aged people.

TI  - β-catenin mediates stress resilience through Dicer1/microRNA regulation.
PG  - 51-5
LID - 10.1038/nature13976 [doi]
AB  - β-catenin is a multi-functional protein that has an important role in the mature 
      central nervous system; its dysfunction has been implicated in several 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. Here we show that in mice 
      β-catenin mediates pro-resilient and anxiolytic effects in the nucleus accumbens, 
      a key brain reward region, an effect mediated by D2-type medium spiny neurons. 
      Using genome-wide β-catenin enrichment mapping, we identify Dicer1-important in 
      small RNA (for example, microRNA) biogenesis--as a β-catenin target gene that 
      mediates resilience. Small RNA profiling after excising β-catenin from nucleus 
      accumbens in the context of chronic stress reveals β-catenin-dependent microRNA 
      regulation associated with resilience. Together, these findings establish 
      β-catenin as a critical regulator in the development of behavioural resilience, 
      activating a network that includes Dicer1 and downstream microRNAs. We thus 
      present a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic targets to promote 
      stress resilience.

TI  - Environmental enrichment rescues female-specific hyperactivity of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in a model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - e133
LID - 10.1038/tp.2012.58 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) has long been regarded as a disease of the central 
      nervous system, partly due to typical disease symptoms that include loss of motor 
      control, cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric disturbances. However, the 
      huntingtin gene is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. We had previously 
      reported a female-specific depression-related behavioural phenotype in the R6/1 
      transgenic mouse model of HD. One hypothesis suggests that pathology of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the key physiological stress-response 
      system that links central and peripheral organs, is a cause of depression. There 
      is evidence of HPA axis pathology in HD, but whether it contributes to the female 
      R6/1 behavioural phenotype is unclear. We have examined HPA axis response of R6/1 
      mice following acute stress and found evidence of a female-specific dysregulation 
      of the HPA axis in R6/1 mice, which we further isolated to a hyper-response of 
      adrenal cortical cells to stimulation by adrenocorticotrophin hormone. 
      Interestingly, the adrenal pathophysiology was not detected in mice that had been 
      housed in environmentally enriching conditions, an effect of enrichment that was 
      also reproduced in vitro. This constitutes the first evidence that environmental 
      enrichment can in fact exert a lasting influence on peripheral organ function. 
      Cognitive stimulation may therefore not only have benefits for mental function, 
      but also for overall physiological wellbeing.

TI  - Essential role of microglial transforming growth factor-β1 in antidepressant 
      actions of (R)-ketamine and the novel antidepressant TGF-β1.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1038/s41398-020-0733-x [doi]
LID - 32
AB  - In rodent models of depression, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and 
      longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine; however, the precise 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R)-ketamine remain 
      unknown. Using RNA-sequencing analysis, we identified novel molecular targets 
      that contribute to the different antidepressant effects of the two enantiomers. 
      Either (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) or (S)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) was administered to 
      susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). RNA-sequencing 
      analysis of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and subsequent GSEA (gene set enrichment 
      analysis) revealed that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling might 
      contribute to the different antidepressant effects of the two enantiomers. 
      (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine, ameliorated the reduced expressions of Tgfb1 
      and its receptors (Tgfbr1 and Tgfbr2) in the PFC and hippocampus of CSDS 
      susceptible mice. Either pharmacological inhibitors (i.e., RepSox and SB431542) 
      or neutralizing antibody of TGF-β1 blocked the antidepressant effects of 
      (R)-ketamine in CSDS susceptible mice. Moreover, depletion of microglia by the 
      colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX3397 blocked the 
      antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine in CSDS susceptible mice. Similar to 
      (R)-ketamine, the recombinant TGF-β1 elicited rapid and long-lasting 
      antidepressant effects in animal models of depression. Our data implicate a novel 
      microglial TGF-β1-dependent mechanism underlying the antidepressant effects of 
      (R)-ketamine in rodents with depression-like phenotype. Moreover, TGF-β1 and its 
      receptor agonists would likely constitute a novel rapid-acting and sustained 
      antidepressant in humans.

TI  - Dominance hierarchy influences adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.
PG  - 6755-9
AB  - Many mammalian species form dominance hierarchies, but it remains unknown whether 
      differences in social status correspond to structural differences in the brain. 
      Stressful experiences may arise naturally during the establishment of dominance, 
      and stress has been linked to adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. To determine 
      whether position in a dominance hierarchy leads to changes in adult neurogenesis 
      in the hippocampus, we examined the brains of rats housed in a visible burrow 
      system (VBS), a seminaturalistic environment with opportunities for social 
      interaction. Dominance hierarchies emerged among the males in all colonies within 
      3 d of living in the VBS. Although cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus did 
      not differ between the groups, more new neurons were observed in the dentate 
      gyrus of the dominant males compared with both subordinates and controls. 
      Dominant and subordinate animals showed similar basal, stress, and recovery from 
      stress levels of corticosterone, as well as similar thymus, adrenal gland, and 
      body weights, suggesting that variables other than stress are responsible for the 
      observed changes in adult neurogenesis. The differences in brain structure 
      persisted among the animals that had no access to the burrow system after the 
      dominance hierarchy stabilized, suggesting that social status rather than living 
      in a complex environment accounts for the effect of dominance on adult 
      neurogenesis.

TI  - Involvement of Epigenetic Modifications of GABAergic Interneurons in Basolateral 
      Amygdala in Anxiety-like Phenotype of Prenatally Stressed Mice.
PG  - 570-581
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyy006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal stress is considered a risk factor for anxiety disorder. 
      Downregulation in the expression of GABAergic gene, that is, glutamic acid 
      decarboxylase 67, associated with DNA methyltransferase overexpression in 
      GABAergic neurons has been regarded as a characteristic component of anxiety 
      disorder. Prenatal stress has an adverse effect on the development of the 
      basolateral amygdala, which is a key region in anxiety regulation. The aim of 
      this study is to analyze the possibility of epigenetic alterations of GABAergic 
      neurons in the basolateral amygdala participating in prenatal stress-induced 
      anxiety. METHODS: Behavioral tests were used to explore the prenatal 
      stress-induced anxiety behaviors of female adult mice. Real-time RT-PCR, western 
      blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophysiological analysis were 
      employed to detect epigenetic changes of GABAergic system in the basolateral 
      amygdala. RESULTS: Prenatal stress mice developed an anxiety-like phenotype 
      accompanied by a significant increase of DNA methyltransferase 1 and a reduced 
      expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 in the basolateral amygdala. 
      Prenatal stress mice also showed the increased binding of DNA methyltransferase 1 
      and methyl CpG binding protein 2 to glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter 
      region. The decrease of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 transcript was paralleled 
      by an enrichment of 5-methylcytosine in glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter 
      regions. Electrophysiological study revealed the increase of postsynaptic 
      neuronal excitability in the cortical-basolateral amygdala synaptic transmission 
      of prenatal stress mice. 5-Aza-deoxycytidine treatment restored the increased 
      synaptic transmission and anxiety-like behaviors in prenatal stress mice via 
      improving GABAergic system. CONCLUSION: The above results suggest that DNA 
      epigenetic modifications of GABAergic interneurons in the basolateral amygdala 
      participate in the etiology of anxiety-like phenotype in prenatal stress mice.

TI  - Antidepressant and antistress activity of GC-MS characterized lipophilic extracts 
      of Ginkgo biloba leaves.
PG  - 1061-5
AB  - Lipophilic extracts of Ginkgo biloba L. leaves were tested for their possible 
      role on rodent models of depression and stress. Lipophilic extracts of Ginkgo 
      leaves (LEG) at (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) exhibited dose dependent, significant 
      antidepressant activity in the behavioral despair test and learned helplessness 
      rodent model of depression. The activities were comparable to that of imipramine 
      (15 mg/kg) and EGb 761 (50 mg/kg). In the cold immobilization stress induced 
      gastric ulcer model of stress, only the LEG showed a significant reduction in the 
      ulcer index. GC-MS characterization of this bioactive extract was found to be 
      rich in a group of 6-alkyl salicylates (6-AS), along with a fatty alcohol, fatty 
      acids and cardanols. The n-heptadecenyl salicylate represented 60% of the 6-AS. 
      Notable was the absence of dihydroxy alkylphenols which are linked to allergic 
      reactions similar to the urushiols present in poison ivy. In commercial products 
      of Ginkgo, these dihydroxy phenols as well as the favorable 6-AS are removed 
      during enrichment of flavonol glycosides and terpenic lactones. The current 
      findings suggest that intact carboxylic acid groups containing 6-AS are the 
      bioactive components of the lipophilic extract of Ginkgo leaves with 
      antidepressant and antistress activities.

TI  - Challenges of work-life balance for women physicians/mothers working in 
      leadership positions.
PG  - 244-50
LID - 10.1016/j.genm.2012.04.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Female leadership in medicine is still disproportionately small, 
      which might be due to the barriers of combining work and family. OBJECTIVES: The 
      aim of this study was, first, to perform a strengths, weakness, opportunities, 
      and threats (SWOT) analysis and, second, to create a strategic concept for career 
      development. METHODS: In this study, all women in leadership positions in the 
      health care system in Vienna, Austria, with at least 1 child (n = 8), were 
      interviewed about the advantages and disadvantages of gender with regard to 
      career development, the strengths and weaknesses of female leadership, and their 
      work-life balance. Different factors that influenced the work-life balance were 
      specified, and career strategies to realize adequate solutions were developed. 
      RESULTS: The sporadic focus on career advancement, time-consuming child care, 
      responsibility for family life, and a woman's tendency toward understatement were 
      barriers to career development. Work-family enrichment has a positive spillover 
      effect that spreads positive energy and helps to balance the work-life 
      relationship. For each individual, the allocation and interaction of different 
      resources such as time, money, scope of decision making, and physical, emotional, 
      and social resources, were essential to maintain the individual work-life 
      balance. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the existing "glass ceiling," the 
      predominant responsibility for child care is still borne by the woman. However, 
      mentoring programs, coaching, networking, and support of the partner or of other 
      people help to strengthen female "soft" skills and achieve a work-life balance.

TI  - Insensitivity to reward shifts in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and implications for 
      assessing affective states.
PG  - 87-100
LID - 10.1007/s10071-019-01318-6 [doi]
AB  - Theory and empirical findings predict that individuals in a negative affective 
      state are more sensitive to unexpected reward loss and less sensitive to 
      unexpected reward gain compared to individuals in a neutral or positive affective 
      state. We explore the use of sensitivity to reward shifts measured during 
      successive contrast tasks as an indicator of affect in zebrafish (Danio rerio). 
      In line with the assumption that exposure to rewarding stimuli induces a 
      relatively positive affective state compared to exposure to stimuli that they do 
      not prefer, we confirmed that zebrafish prefer enriched over barren environments, 
      suggesting that the enriched environment is associated with positive affective 
      states. We trained individuals to swim down a channel for food rewards of 
      differing value and then presented them with unexpected increases or decreases in 
      reward value. Contrary to our hypothesis, individuals conditioned to a high-value 
      reward continued swimming at the same speed when reward value was downshifted, 
      thus showing no successive negative contrast effect and appearing insensitive to 
      reward loss. Individuals whose rewards were upshifted gradually increased their 
      speed, but did not display successive positive contrast effects typical of 
      sensitivity to reward gains. In both cases, housing type did not result in 
      differences in swim time. One potential explanation is that goal-directed control 
      of behaviour is necessary for an animal to show a successive contrast response to 
      unexpected reward gain or loss, and the behaviour of zebrafish in this task was 
      under habitual control, perhaps due to over-training. If so, refinements to task 
      design and training procedures will allow further progress with this assay.

TI  - Psychosocial predictors of sudden death: a review and critique.
PG  - 667-80
AB  - Research and selected case studies concerning psychosocial prediction of sudden 
      death are evaluated under three categories: sudden cardiac, sudden infant and 
      sudden traumatic death. The psychosocial predictors reviewed include 
      novelty-pre-exposure, control-helplessness, restraint, Type A behavior, life 
      change, bereavement, denial, social support and contact, voodoo, psychiatric 
      illness, mother infant separation, submission-defeat, housing, handling and 
      environmental enrichment. Four of these predictors, controllability-helplessness, 
      pre-exposure-novelty, depressive affect and physical restraint are repeatedly 
      cited in both human and animal studies and their importance is critically 
      evaluated. Methodological and substantive recommendations for future research are 
      made and a discussion of possible mechanisms is presented.

TI  - Social Status in Monkeys: Effects of Social Confrontation on Brain Function and 
      Cocaine Self-Administration.
PG  - 1093-1102
LID - 10.1038/npp.2016.285 [doi]
AB  - Individual differences in response to social stress and environmental enrichment 
      may contribute to variability in response to behavioral and pharmacological 
      treatments for drug addiction. In monkeys, social status influences the 
      reinforcing effects of cocaine and the effects of some drugs on cocaine 
      self-administration. In this study, we used male cynomolgus macaques (n=15) 
      living in established social groups to examine the effects of social 
      confrontation on the reinforcing effects of cocaine using a food-drug choice 
      procedure. On the test day, a dominant or subordinate monkey was removed from his 
      homecage and placed into another social pen; 30 min later he was studied in a 
      cocaine-food choice paradigm. For the group, following social confrontation, 
      sensitivity to cocaine reinforcement was significantly greater in subordinate 
      monkeys compared with dominant animals. Examining individual-subject data 
      revealed that for the majority of monkeys (9/15), serving as an intruder in 
      another social group affected cocaine self-administration and these effects were 
      dependent on the social rank of the monkey. For subordinate monkeys, sensitivity 
      to the reinforcing effects of cocaine increased while sensitivity decreased in 
      dominant monkeys. To investigate potential mechanisms mediating these effects, 
      brain glucose metabolism was studied in a subset of monkeys (n=8) using 
      [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) with positron emission tomography. 
      Dominant and subordinate monkeys displayed distinctly different patterns of brain 
      glucose metabolism in their homecage, including areas associated with vigilance 
      and stress/anxiety, respectively, and during social confrontation. These data 
      demonstrate that, depending on an individual's social status, the same social 
      experience can have divergent effects on brain function and cocaine 
      self-administration. These phenotypic differences in response to social 
      conditions support a personalized treatment approach to cocaine addiction.

TI  - Hypercortisolemia and Depressive-like Behaviors in a Rhesus Macaque (Macaca 
      mulatta) Involved in Visual Research.
PG  - 529-536
AB  - A 10-y-old cranially implanted rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) involved in visual 
      research was presented for dull mentation and weight loss. Physical examination 
      revealed alopecia and poor body conditioning, and bloodwork revealed marked 
      hypercortisolemia (23 μg/dL). Differential diagnoses for hypercortisolemia, 
      weight loss, and alopecia included Cushing and pseudo-Cushing syndromes. To 
      further evaluate hypercortisolemia, we compared the urine cortisol:creatinine 
      ratio (UCCR) at baseline and after low-dose dexamethasone suppression (LDDS) 
      testing in the presenting animal and healthy naïve and implanted working monkeys. 
      At baseline, UCCR was 10 times higher in the presenting macaque (118.1 ± 7.1) 
      than in naïve animals (12.5 ± 12.8) and 3 times higher than in healthy implanted 
      working macaques (44.4 ± 6.9); however, levels were suppressed similarly by 
      dexamethasone in both the presenting animal and healthy controls. In addition, 
      healthy implanted working macaques had significantly higher baseline UCCR levels 
      than naïve controls, suggesting chronic stress in working animals. Abdominal 
      ultrasonography and radiographs of the presenting animal revealed marked 
      bilateral adrenal mineralization but no overt adrenal tumor or hyperplasia. 
      Overall, these results excluded endogenous Cushing syndrome and prompted us to 
      evaluate different causes of pseudo-Cushing syndrome, including depression. Using 
      videorecordings to evaluate behavior, we used published criteria for macaque 
      models of depression models, including huddling, to make a presumptive diagnosis 
      of depression. The macaque was treated with fluoxetine (2 mg/kg PO daily), 
      provided increased environmental enrichment, and followed over time by regular 
      UCCR assessment and videorecordings. The animal improved clinically and 
      behaviorally, and UCCR returned to levels observed in working implanted macaques 
      (44.4) after 8 wk of treatment. This case highlights the potential effect of 
      research-related work on stress and pathologic behaviors in macaques and 
      demonstrates the utility of UCCR and LDDS for screening behavioral and 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal abnormalities in these animals.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiaochaihutang (XCHT), one of famous Chinese 
      herbal prescription for treating Shaoyang symptom, has been used successfully in 
      depressive disorders for many years. Our laboratory has demonstrated that XCHT 
      remarkably alleviated various depressive behaviors induced by several depressive 
      animal models, but previous studies only focused on one or several protein 
      targets, lacked dynamic change and interrelation of proteins. Therefore, 
      potential protein targets and mechanisms are required further systematic 
      investigation. AIM OF THE STUDY: To discover and assess the differentially 
      expressed proteins (DEPs) of hippocampus after oral administration of XCHT in 
      corticosterone (CORT) induced model of depression by using isobaric tags for 
      relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      antidepressant effects of XCHT were assessed by two behavioral despair models 
      (forced swimming test and tail suspension test) in CORT induced model of 
      depression. The DEPs of hippocampus after XCHT treatment were investigated by 
      iTRAQ analysis. Potential protein targets and mechanisms were assessed by gene 
      ontology (GO), Kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated XCHT could 
      significantly improve depressive behaviors. A total of 241 DEPs were identified 
      after XCHT treatment, including 68 up regulation and 173 down regulation 
      proteins. GO enrichment results indicated that XCHT mainly regulated 
      intracellular structural proteins involved in cellular response to stress, 
      transferase activity and steroid hormone. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that 
      endocytosis might be the principal pathway of XCHT on depression. PPI analysis 
      predicted cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator protein 1 (Ccar1) and 
      Calretinin (Calb2) might play the central roles in XCHT's antidepressant network. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that XCHT plays the important roles in 
      antidepressant action by restoring DEPs, which results in the dysregulation of 
      hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotransmitter and steroid hormone. The current 
      results wish to provide novel perspectives for revealing the potential protein 
      targets of XCHT on depression.

AB  - There are currently no validated pharmacotherapies for posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD)-related insomnia. The purpose of the National Adaptive Trial for 
      PTSD-Related Insomnia (NAP Study) is to efficiently compare to placebo the 
      effects of three insomnia medications with different mechanisms of action that 
      are already prescribed widely to veterans diagnosed with PTSD within U.S. 
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers. This study plans to enroll 
      1224 patients from 34 VA Medical Centers into a 12- week prospective, randomized 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing trazodone, eszopiclone, and 
      gabapentin. The primary outcome measure is insomnia, assessed with the Insomnia 
      Severity Index. A novel aspect of this study is its adaptive design. At the 
      recruitment midpoint, an interim analysis will be conducted to inform a decision 
      to close recruitment to any "futile" arms (i.e. arms where further recruitment is 
      very unlikely to yield a significant result) while maintaining the overall study 
      recruitment target. This step could result in the enrichment of the remaining 
      study arms, enhancing statistical power for the remaining comparisons to placebo. 
      This study will also explore clinical, actigraphic, and biochemical predictors of 
      treatment response that may guide future biomarker development. Lastly, due to 
      the COVID-19 pandemic, this study will allow the consenting process and follow-up 
      visits to be conducted via video or phone contact if in-person meetings are not 
      possible. Overall, this study aims to identify at least one effective 
      pharmacotherapy for PTSD-related insomnia, and, perhaps, to generate definitive 
      negative data to reduce the use of ineffective insomnia medications. NATIONAL 
      CLINICAL TRIAL (NCT) IDENTIFIED NUMBER: NCT03668041.

TI  - [Features of behavioral reactions of chronically irradiated mice in the raised 
      crosswise labyrinth with various genetically determined radiosensitivity and 
      possibilities of their modification by the fungal biopolymer complex].
PG  - 170-82
AB  - Structural elements of the central nervous system--neurons, along with the higher 
      neuroendocrine structures and the hypothalamus centres, show high sensitivity to 
      a chronic action of low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) in view of their extreme 
      enrichment by phospholipids and intensive supply by oxygen, creating favorable 
      conditions for the development of oxidizing stress. Stressful influences cause 
      negative emotions in the behaviour of animals manifested as fear or uneasiness. 
      The study represents the results of comparative research into the behavioral 
      reactions characterized by uneasiness in the Balb/c and C57bl/6 mice exposed to a 
      chronic irradiation at low doses. The chitin-melanin-glucan complex from fungi 
      Fomes fomentarius (ChMG) was approved as an adaptive agent. It has been shown 
      that under identical conditions, deposition levels of radionuclides 137Cs and 
      90Sr are raised in mice with IR hypersensitivity--line Balb/c, in comparison with 
      less radio sensitive mice--line C57bl/6. Simultaneously, Balb/c mice were 
      observed to exhibit the signs of a more anxious behaviour in the new environment. 
      Chronic external and internal radiation exposure to rare ionizing radiation at 
      low doses promotes strengthening of anxiety and phobic reactions in mice with IR 
      hypersensitivity. The use of ChMG in animals neutralized the increase in anxiety 
      and phobic reactions after a prolonged irradiation, thus indicating the presence 
      in ChMG of the anxiolitic activity along with the above mentioned powerful 
      radiosorbent, antioxidant, gene protective and immunomodulatory properties.

AB  - Individual housing of social species is a common phenomenon in laboratory animal 
      facilities. Single housing, however, is known to inflict social deprivation with 
      a number of detrimental consequences. Aiming to improve housing conditions of 
      single housed rodents, we investigated the simulation of social housing by 
      mirrors in a series of behavioural experiments and biochemical parameters in 
      mice. We found that chronic mirror-image stimulation increased exploratory 
      behaviours in the holeboard and novel cage tests, but did not alter anxiety, 
      locomotor, or depression-like behaviours. Moreover, no influence on visual 
      recognition memory was observed. Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      (BDNF) levels, a biomarker for enrichment effects, were unaltered. In line, 
      mirror-image stimulation did not alter home cage behaviour in mice housed with 
      and without mirrors when left undisturbed. Thus, though we found subtle 
      behavioural effects after long-term mirror exposure, we conclude that the 
      simulation of social housing by mirrors is not sufficient to gain the presumably 
      beneficial outcomes induced by social housing.

TI  - The influence of natural variations in maternal care on play fighting in the rat.
PG  - 767-76
LID - 10.1002/dev.20342 [doi]
AB  - Naturally occurring variations in maternal care in the rat influence the 
      sensitivity of offspring to stress in adulthood. The offspring of mothers that 
      show lower levels of pup licking/grooming (i.e., low-LG mothers) demonstrate 
      enhanced responses to stress and increased anxiety compared to those of high-LG 
      mothers. Low-LG offspring are also more sensitive to the influence of 
      environmental enrichment than high-LG offspring. This study examined play 
      fighting in the juvenile offspring of high-LG and low-LG dams in a multiple-play 
      partners housing environment. Male offspring from low-LG dams demonstrated a 
      significantly higher frequency of pouncing, pinning and aggressive social 
      grooming than did high-LG males and high-LG and low-LG females. Consistent with 
      earlier reports, male pups engaged in more play fighting than did females and 
      maternal care was associated with differences in play fighting but only in males. 
      Lower levels of stimulation in the form of LG from the dam during perinatal 
      development may thus increase sensitivity for the stimulating effects of play 
      behavior in periadolescence, in part explaining the increased solicitation of 
      play fighting through increased pouncing in the male offspring of the low-LG 
      mothers. These findings identify a possible influence of variations in maternal 
      care on play fighting and suggest that maternal care in the perinatal period 
      influence social interactions during periadolescence.

TI  - Does trait affectivity predict work-to-family conflict and enrichment beyond job 
      characteristics?
PG  - 197-216
AB  - The present study examines whether negative and positive affectivity (NA and PA, 
      respectively) predict different forms of work-to-family conflict (WFC-time, 
      WFC-strain, WFC-behavior) and enrichment (WFE-development, WFE-affect, 
      WFE-capital) beyond job characteristics (workload, autonomy, variety, workplace 
      support). Furthermore, interactions between job characteristics and trait 
      affectivity while predicting WFC and WFE were examined. Using a large sample of 
      Slovenian employees (N = 738), NA and PA were found to explain variance in WFC as 
      well as in WFE above and beyond job characteristics. More precisely, NA 
      significantly predicted WFC, whereas PA significantly predicted WFE. In addition, 
      several interactive effects were found to predict forms of WFC and WFE. These 
      results highlight the importance of trait affectivity in work-family research. 
      They provide further support for the crucial impact of job characteristics as 
      well.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of monocytes from HIV-positive men on antiretroviral 
      therapy reveals effects of tobacco smoking on interferon and stress response 
      systems associated with depressive symptoms.
PG  - 59

LID - 59
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking induces immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory effects 
      associated with transcriptome changes in monocytes and other immune cell types. 
      While smoking is prevalent in HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals, few studies have 
      investigated its effects on gene expression in this population. Here, we report 
      whole-transcriptome analyses of 125 peripheral blood monocyte samples from 
      ART-treated HIV+ and uninfected (HIV-) men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS 
      Cohort Study (MACS) (n = 25 HIV+ smokers, n = 60 HIV+ non-smokers, n = 40 HIV- 
      non-smoking controls). Gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina 
      HumanHT-12 Expression BeadChip microarrays. Differential expression analysis was 
      performed with weighted linear regression models using the R limma package, 
      followed by functional enrichment and Ingenuity Pathway analyses. RESULTS: A 
      total of 286 genes were differentially expressed in monocytes from HIV+ smokers 
      compared with HIV- non-smokers; upregulated genes (n = 180) were enriched for 
      immune and interferon response, chemical/stress response, mitochondria, and 
      extracellular vesicle gene ontology (GO) terms. Expression of genes related to 
      immune/interferon responses (AIM2, FCGR1A-B, IFI16, SP100), stress/chemical 
      responses (APAF1, HSPD1, KLF4), and mitochondrial function (CISD1, MTHFD2, SQOR) 
      was upregulated in HIV+ non-smokers and further increased in HIV+ smokers. Gene 
      expression changes associated with smoking in previous studies of human monocytes 
      were also observed (SASH1, STAB1, PID1, MMP25). Depressive symptoms (CES-D scores 
      ≥ 16) were more prevalent in HIV+ tobacco smokers compared with HIV+ and HIV- 
      non-smokers (50% vs. 26% and 13%, respectively; p = 0.007), and upregulation of 
      immune/interferon response genes, including IFI35, IFNAR1, OAS1-2, STAT1, and 
      SP100, was associated with depressive symptoms in logistic regression models 
      adjusted for HIV status and smoking (p < 0.05). Network models linked the 
      Stat1-mediated interferon pathway to transcriptional regulator Klf4 and 
      smoking-associated toll-like receptor scaffolding protein Sash1, suggesting 
      inter-relationships between smoking-associated genes, control of monocyte 
      differentiation, and interferon-mediated inflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study characterizes immune, interferon, stress response, and 
      mitochondrial-associated gene expression changes in monocytes from HIV+ tobacco 
      smokers, and identifies augmented interferon and stress responses associated with 
      depressive symptoms. These findings help to explain complex interrelationships 
      between pro-inflammatory effects of HIV and smoking, and their combined impact on 
      comorbidities prevalent in HIV+ individuals.

TI  - [More tolerance in management of unmotivated elderly family members].
PG  - 223-32
AB  - The elderly frequently experiences demotivation as a sign of depression. 
      Demotivation often results in failures of relationships and isolation increases 
      confusion of the demotivated individuals who are often additionally impaired by 
      physical illness or its sequels. The elderly exposes himself to an affective 
      dependence on engaged services or relationships. Motivation is also threatened by 
      consequences of physical dependence which alters self-esteem. The difficulty to 
      adapt to new situations adds up with poor social integration in an increasingly 
      complex environment. This often precludes loss of ability to execute personal 
      decisions and to cope with daily activities. This all accentuates dependence and 
      depression and promotes further withdrawal. Impairment of cognitive functions and 
      withdrawal increase the burden of familial suffering. We propose solutions 
      adapted to demotivated elderly people in order to reintegrate them in their 
      family and daily life.

TI  - Using animal models of enriched environments to inform research on sensory 
      integration intervention for the rehabilitation of neurodevelopmental disorders.
PG  - 120-32
LID - 10.1007/s11689-010-9053-4 [doi]
AB  - The field of behavioral neuroscience has been successful in using an animal model 
      of enriched environments for over five decades to measure the rehabilitative and 
      preventative effects of sensory, cognitive and motor stimulation in animal 
      models. Several key principles of enriched environments match those used in 
      sensory integration therapy, a treatment used for children with 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. This paper reviews the paradigm of environmental 
      enrichment, compares animal models of enriched environments to principles of 
      sensory integration treatment, and discusses applications for the rehabilitation 
      of neurodevelopmental disorders. Based on this review, the essential features in 
      the enriched environment paradigm which should be included in sensory integration 
      treatment are multiple sensory experiences, novelty in the environment, and 
      active engagement in challenging cognitive, sensory, and motor tasks. Use of 
      sensory integration treatment may be most applicable for children with anxiety, 
      hypersensitivity, repetitive behaviors or heightened levels of stress. 
      Additionally, individuals with deficits in social behavior, social participation, 
      or impairments in learning and memory may show gains with this type of treatment.

TI  - Behavioral responses of maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus, Canidae) to 
      different categories of environmental enrichment stimuli and their implications 
      for successful reintroduction.
PG  - 453-69
LID - 10.1002/zoo.20410 [doi]
AB  - The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus, Illiger, 1815, Canidae) is a threatened 
      species that inhabits the cerrados of Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, 
      and Uruguay. Captive maned wolves could be potentially used in reintroduction 
      programs for species conservation; however, it is necessary that their behavior 
      and cognitive abilities are conserved. Environmental enrichment is a tool used to 
      stimulate captive animals and maintain a natural behavioral repertoire. To 
      compare the variation of captive maned wolves' behavioral responses to 
      environmental enrichment, we studied three maned wolves held by Belo Horizonte 
      Zoo, Brazil. Foraging, interspecific, and intraspecific stimuli were offered to 
      the animals and their responses were compared with a baseline and postenrichment 
      treatments. The test was used to help in choosing which one of the three 
      individuals would participate in a reintroduction project. The results showed 
      that stimuli type did influence the animal's responses, and that individually 
      wolves responded differently to foraging, interspecific, and intraspecific 
      enrichment items (P80.05 for some behaviors in each enrichment category). The 
      individual's personality seemed to influence their behavioral responses, with 
      animals showing bold and shy responses, and this trait should be considered 
      during decision makings for reintroduction.

AB  - The unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model has been used to induce 
      depressive-like symptoms in animal models, showing adequate predictive validity. 
      Our work aims to evaluate the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on 
      resilience in this experimental model of depression. We also aim to assess 
      changes in brain connectivity using cytochrome c oxidase histochemistry in 
      cerebral regions related to cognitive-affective processes associated with 
      depressive disorder: dorsal hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, accumbens, 
      and habenula nuclei. Five groups of rats were used: UCMS, EE, EE + UCMS 
      (enrichment + stress), BG (basal level of brain activity), and CONT (behavioral 
      tests only). We assessed the hedonic responses elicited by sucrose solution using 
      a consumption test; the anxiety level was evaluated using the elevated zero maze 
      test, and the unconditioned fear responses were assessed by the cat odor test. 
      The behavioral results showed that the UCMS protocol induces elevated anhedonia 
      and anxiety. But these responses are attenuated previous exposure to EE. 
      Regarding brain activity, the UCMS group showed greater activity in the habenula 
      compared to the EE + UCMS group. EE induced a functional reorganization of brain 
      activity. The EE + UCMS and UCMS groups showed different patterns of connections 
      between brain regions. Our results showed that EE favors greater resilience and 
      could reduce vulnerability to disorders such as depression and anxiety, modifying 
      metabolic brain activity.

TI  - Mechanistic insights into the anti-depressant effect of emodin: an integrated 
      systems pharmacology study and experimental validation.
PG  - 15078-15099
LID - 10.18632/aging.203072 [doi]
AB  - Depression is a complex neuropsychiatric disease involved multiple targets and 
      signaling pathways. Systems pharmacology studies could potentially present a 
      comprehensive molecular mechanism to delineate the anti-depressant effect of 
      emodin (EMO). In this study, we investigated the anti-depressant effects of EMO 
      in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression and 
      gained insights into the underlying mechanisms using systems pharmacology and 
      molecular simulation analysis. Forty-three potential targets of EMO for treatment 
      of depression were obtained. GO biological process analysis suggested that the 
      biological functions of these targets mainly involve the regulation of reactive 
      oxygen species metabolic process, response to lipopolysaccharide, regulation of 
      inflammatory response, etc. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the 
      PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, insulin resistance, IL-17 signaling pathway were the 
      most significantly enriched signaling pathways. The molecular docking analysis 
      revealed that EMO might have a strong combination with ESR1, AKT1 and GSK3B. 
      Immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting showed that 2 weeks' EMO 
      treatment (80 mg/kg/day) reduced depression related microglial activation, 
      neuroinflammation and altered PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our findings provide a 
      systemic pharmacology basis for the anti-depressant effects of EMO.

TI  - How Do Work Engagement, Workaholism, and the Work-to-Family Interface Affect Each 
      Other? A 7-Year Follow-Up Study.
PG  - 601-9
LID - 10.1097/JOM.0000000000000457 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term relationships between work engagement, 
      workaholism, work-to-family enrichment, and work-to-family conflict (WFC). 
      METHODS: We used structural equation modeling and the three-wave 7-year follow-up 
      data of 1580 Finnish dentists to test our hypotheses. RESULTS: Work engagement 
      and work-to-family enrichment mutually predicted each other, and work engagement 
      also negatively predicted WFC. Workaholism predicted WFC, but not vice versa. 
      Work engagement and workaholism were unrelated over time. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results indicate that beyond its suggested benefits for organizations, work 
      engagement may boost the positive interaction between work and family, whereas 
      workaholism is likely to lead to WFC over time. It is valuable for organizations 
      to distinguish work engagement from workaholism and to enhance the former while 
      preventing the latter to have sustainably hardworking working employees with 
      happy home lives.

TI  - Glucocorticoid-induced loss of DNA methylation in non-neuronal cells and 
      potential involvement of DNMT1 in epigenetic regulation of Fkbp5.
PG  - 570-5
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.03.035 [doi]
AB  - Glucocorticoids may play a significant role in the etiology of neuropsychiatric 
      illnesses. Abnormalities in plasma cortisol levels, glucocorticoid sensitivity, 
      and HPA-axis function often accompany clinical symptoms of stress-related 
      illnesses such as PTSD and depression. Of particular interest are genetic 
      association studies that link single nucleotide polymorphisms of HPA-axis genes 
      with illnesses only in the context of an early-life trauma exposure such as child 
      abuse. These studies suggest that dysregulation of HPA-axis function can have 
      lasting repercussions in shaping mood and anxiety, long after termination of the 
      traumatic experience. As persistent glucocorticoid-induced loss of DNA 
      methylation in FK506 binding protein 5 (Fkbp5) was previously observed in the 
      hippocampus and blood and in the neuronal cell line HT-22, we asked whether these 
      epigenetic alterations occur in non-neuronal, HPA-axis relevant cells. We used 
      the pituitary adenoma cell line AtT-20 to demonstrate that the intronic enhancer 
      region of Fkbp5 undergoes loss of DNA methylation in response to dexamethasone 
      treatment in a dose-dependent manner. We also focused on the mouse hippocampal 
      dentate gyrus to test whether these changes would be enriched in a region 
      implicated in the HPA-axis stress response, neurogenesis, and synaptic 
      plasticity. We observed an increase in enrichment of DNA methylation loss in the 
      dentate gyrus, as compared to whole hippocampal tissues that were similarly 
      treated with glucocorticoids. We then asked whether DNA methyltransferase 1 
      (Dnmt1), a methyltransferase enzyme involved in maintaining DNA methylation 
      following cell division, is involved in the observed epigenetic alterations. We 
      found a dose-dependent decrease of Dnmt1 expression in the AtT-20 cells following 
      dexamethasone treatment, and a similar decrease in corticosterone-treated mouse 
      hippocampus. Taken together, we provide evidence that these 
      glucocorticoid-induced epigenetic alterations have a broader validity in 
      non-neuronal cells and that they may involve the DNA methylation machinery.

      dentate gyrus.

AB  - Neurogenesis persists in certain regions of the adult brain including the 
      subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus wherein its regulation is 
      essential, particularly in relation to learning, stress and modulation of mood. 
      Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an extracellular signaling phospholipid with 
      important neural regulatory properties mediated by specific G protein-coupled 
      receptors, LPA(1-5). LPA(1) is highly expressed in the developing neurogenic 
      ventricular zone wherein it is required for normal embryonic neurogenesis, and, 
      by extension may play a role in adult neurogenesis as well. By means of the 
      analyses of a variant of the original LPA(1)-null mutant mouse, termed the Malaga 
      variant or "maLPA(1)-null," which has recently been reported to have defective 
      neurogenesis within the embryonic cerebral cortex, we report here a role for 
      LPA(1) in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Proliferation, differentiation and 
      survival of newly formed neurons are defective in the absence of LPA(1) under 
      normal conditions and following exposure to enriched environment and voluntary 
      exercise. Furthermore, analysis of trophic factors in maLPA(1)-null mice 
      demonstrated alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin growth 
      factor 1 levels after enrichment and exercise. Morphological analyses of 
      doublecortin positive cells revealed the anomalous prevalence of bipolar cells in 
      the subgranular zone, supporting the operation of LPA(1) signaling pathways in 
      normal proliferation, maturation and differentiation of neuronal precursors.

AB  - Environmental enrichment produces protective addiction and depression phenotypes 
      in rats. ΔFosB is a transcription factor that regulates reward in the brain and 
      is induced by psychological stress as well as drugs of abuse. However, the role 
      played by ΔFosB in the protective phenotypes of environmental enrichment has not 
      been well studied. Here, we demonstrate that ΔFosB is differentially regulated in 
      rats reared in an isolated condition (IC) compared to those in an enriched 
      condition (EC) in response to restraint stress or cocaine. Chronic stress or 
      chronic cocaine treatment each elevates ΔFosB protein levels in the nucleus 
      accumbens (NAc) of IC rats, but not of EC rats due to an already elevated basal 
      accumulation of ΔFosB seen under EC conditions. Viral-mediated overexpression of 
      ΔFosB in the NAc shell of pair-housed rats (i.e., independent of environmental 
      enrichment/isolation) increases operant responding for sucrose when motivated by 
      hunger, but decreases responding in satiated animals. Moreover, ΔFosB 
      overexpression decreases cocaine self-administration, enhances extinction of 
      cocaine seeking, and decreases cocaine-induced reinstatement of intravenous 
      cocaine self-administration; all behavioral findings consistent with the 
      enrichment phenotype. In contrast, however, ΔFosB overexpression did not alter 
      responses of pair-housed rats in several tests of anxiety- and depression-related 
      behavior. Thus, ΔFosB in the NAc the shell mimics the protective addiction 
      phenotype, but not the protective depression phenotype of environmental 
      enrichment.

TI  - Dental education and evidence-based educational best practices: bridging the 
      great divide.
PG  - 1266-71
AB  - Research about educational best practices is negatively perceived by many dental 
      faculty. Separation between teaching and learning strategies commonly employed in 
      dental education and evidence-based educational techniques is real and caused by 
      a variety of factors: the often incomprehensible jargon of educational 
      specialists; traditional academic dominance of research, publication, and 
      grantsmanship in faculty promotions; institutional undervaluing of teaching and 
      the educational process; and departmentalization of dental school governance with 
      resultant narrowness of academic vision. Clinician-dentists hired as dental 
      school faculty may model teaching activities on decades-old personal experiences, 
      ignoring recent educational evidence and the academic culture. Dentistry's twin 
      internal weaknesses--factionalism and parochialism--contribute to academic 
      resistance to change and unwillingness to share power. Dental accreditation is a 
      powerful impetus toward inclusion of best teaching and learning evidence in 
      dental education. This article will describe how the gap between traditional 
      educational strategies and research-based practices can be reduced by several 
      approaches including dental schools' promotion of learning cultures that 
      encourage and reward faculty who earn advanced degrees in education, regular 
      evaluation of teaching by peers and educational consultants with inclusion of the 
      results of these evaluations in promotion and tenure committee deliberations, 
      creating tangible reward systems to recognize and encourage teaching excellence, 
      and basing faculty development programs on adult learning principles. Leadership 
      development should be part of faculty enrichment, as effective administration is 
      essential to dental school mission fulfillment. Finally, faculty who investigate 
      the effectiveness of educational techniques need to make their research more 
      available by publishing it, more understandable by reducing educational jargon, 
      and more relevant to the day-to-day teaching issues that dental school faculty 
      encounter in classrooms, labs, and clinics.

TI  - Progressive Transcriptional Changes in the Amygdala Implicate Neuroinflammation 
      in the Effects of Repetitive Low-Level Blast Exposure in Male Rats.
PG  - 561-577
LID - 10.1089/neu.2022.0282 [doi]
AB  - Chronic mental health problems are common among military veterans who sustained 
      blast-related traumatic brain injuries. The reasons for this association remain 
      unexplained. Male rats exposed to repetitive low-level blast overpressure (BOP) 
      exposures exhibit chronic cognitive and post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD)-related traits that develop in a delayed fashion. We examined 
      blast-induced alterations on the transcriptome in four brain areas (anterior 
      cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum) across the time frame over which 
      the PTSD-related behavioral phenotype develops. When analyzed at 6 weeks or 12 
      months after blast exposure, relatively few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      were found. However, longitudinal analysis of amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior 
      cortex between 6 weeks and 12 months revealed blast-specific DEG patterns. Six 
      DEGs (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 [Hapln1], glutamate metabotropic 
      receptor 2 [Grm2], purinergic receptor P2y12 [P2ry12], C-C chemokine receptor 
      type 5 [Ccr5], phenazine biosynthesis-like protein domain containing 1 [Pbld1], 
      and cadherin related 23 [Cdh23]) were found altered in all three brain regions in 
      blast-exposed animals. Pathway enrichment analysis using all DEGs or those 
      uniquely changed revealed different transcription patterns in blast versus sham. 
      In particular, the amygdala in blast-exposed animals had a unique set of enriched 
      pathways related to stress responses, oxidative phosphorylation, and 
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Upstream analysis implicated tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF)α signaling in blast-related effects in amygdala and anterior cortex. 
      Eukaryotic initiating factor eIF4E (EIF4e), an upstream regulator of P2ry12 and 
      Ccr5, was predicted to be activated in the amygdala. Quantitative polymerase 
      chain reaction (qPCR) validated longitudinal changes in two TNFα regulated genes 
      (cathepsin B [Ctsb], Hapln1), P2ry12, and Grm2. These studies have implications 
      for understanding how blast injury damages the brain and implicates inflammation 
      as a potential therapeutic target.

TI  - Systems biology integration of proteomic data in rodent models of depression 
      reveals involvement of the immune response and glutamatergic signaling.

AB  - PURPOSE: The pathophysiological basis of major depression is incompletely 
      understood. Recently, numerous proteomic studies have been performed in rodent 
      models of depression to investigate the molecular underpinnings of 
      depressive-like behaviours with an unbiased approach. The objective of the study 
      is to integrate the results of these proteomic studies in depression models to 
      shed light on the most relevant molecular pathways involved in the disease. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Network analysis is performed integrating preexisting 
      proteomic data from rodent models of depression. The IntAct mouse and the HRPD 
      are used as reference protein-protein interaction databases. The functionality 
      analyses of the networks are then performed by testing overrepresented GO 
      biological process terms and pathways. RESULTS: Functional enrichment analyses of 
      the networks revealed an association with molecular processes related to 
      depression in humans, such as those involved in the immune response. Pathways 
      impacted by clinically effective antidepressants are modulated, including 
      glutamatergic signaling and neurotrophic responses. Moreover, dysregulations of 
      proteins regulating energy metabolism and circadian rhythms are implicated. The 
      comparison with protein pathways modulated in depressive patients revealed 
      significant overlapping. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This systems biology 
      study supports the notion that animal models can contribute to the research into 
      the biology and therapeutics of depression.

TI  - Transcriptional Profiling of Rat Prefrontal Cortex after Acute Inescapable 
      Footshock Stress.
LID - 10.3390/genes14030740 [doi]
LID - 740
AB  - Stress is a primary risk factor for psychiatric disorders such as Major 
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The response 
      to stress involves the regulation of transcriptional programs, which is supposed 
      to play a role in coping with stress. To evaluate transcriptional processes 
      implemented after exposure to unavoidable traumatic stress, we applied microarray 
      expression analysis to the PFC of rats exposed to acute footshock (FS) stress 
      that were sacrificed immediately after the 40 min session or 2 h or 24 h after. 
      While no substantial changes were observed at the single gene level immediately 
      after the stress session, gene set enrichment analysis showed alterations in 
      neuronal pathways associated with glia development, glia-neuron networking, and 
      synaptic function. Furthermore, we found alterations in the expression of gene 
      sets regulated by specific transcription factors that could represent master 
      regulators of the acute stress response. Of note, these pathways and 
      transcriptional programs are activated during the early stress response 
      (immediately after FS) and are already turned off after 2 h-while at 24 h, the 
      transcriptional profile is largely unaffected. Overall, our analysis provided a 
      transcriptional landscape of the early changes triggered by acute unavoidable FS 
      stress in the PFC of rats, suggesting that the transcriptional wave is fast and 
      mild, but probably enough to activate a cellular response to acute stress.

AB  - Depression is a commonly reported co-morbidity during rehabilitation from alcohol 
      use disorders and its presence is associated with an increased likelihood of 
      relapse. Interventions which impede the development of depression could be of 
      potential benefit if incorporated into treatment programs. We previously 
      demonstrated an ameliorative effect of physical exercise on depressive behaviors 
      in a mouse model of alcohol abstinence. Here, we show that environmental 
      enrichment (cognitive and social stimulation) has a similar beneficial effect. 
      The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a key physiological system 
      regulating stress responses and its dysregulation has been separably implicated 
      in the pathophysiology of depression and addiction disorders. We performed a 
      series of dexamethasone challenges and found that mice undergoing 2 weeks of 
      alcohol abstinence had significantly greater corticosterone and ACTH levels 
      following a DEX-CRH challenge compared to water controls. Environmental 
      enrichment during alcohol abstinence corrected the abnormal DEX-CRH 
      corticosterone response despite a further elevation of ACTH levels. Examination 
      of gene expression revealed abstinence-associated alterations in glucocorticoid 
      receptor (Gr), corticotrophin releasing hormone (Crh) and pro-opiomelanocortin 
      (Pomc1) mRNA levels which were differentially modulated by environmental 
      enrichment. Overall, our study demonstrates a benefit of environmental enrichment 
      on alcohol abstinence-associated depressive behaviors and HPA axis dysregulation.

      COVID-19 Lockdown: Intrinsic and Benchmark Values.

LID - 8011
AB  - The prolonged lockdown imposed to contain the COrona VIrus Disease 19 COVID-19 
      pandemic prevented many people from direct contact with nature and greenspaces, 
      raising alarms for a possible worsening of mental health. This study investigated 
      the effectiveness of a simple and affordable remedy for improving psychological 
      well-being, based on audio-visual stimuli brought by a short computer video 
      showing forest environments, with an urban video as a control. Randomly selected 
      participants were assigned the forest or urban video, to look at and listen to 
      early in the morning, and questionnaires to fill out. In particular, the 
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Form Y collected in baseline condition and 
      at the end of the study and the Part II of the Sheehan Patient Rated Anxiety 
      Scale (SPRAS) collected every day immediately before and after watching the 
      video. The virtual exposure to forest environments showed effective to reduce 
      perceived anxiety levels in people forced by lockdown in limited spaces and 
      environmental deprivation. Although significant, the effects were observed only 
      in the short term, highlighting the limitation of the virtual experiences. The 
      reported effects might also represent a benchmark to disentangle the determinants 
      of health effects due to real forest experiences, for example, the inhalation of 
      biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC).

      actigraphy. The median split of volunteers' Eysenck Extraversion scores was used 
      for extravert/introvert categorization. The Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), 
      modified Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), and Stanford Sleepiness Scale 
      (SSS) were administered every 2 hours throughout. PVT speed, transformed lapses, 
      modified MWT sleep-onset latency, and SSS were analyzed using mixed-model 
      analyses of variance, with covariates of age and total actigraphic activity 
      during enrichment or impoverishment. SETTING: residential sleep/performance 
      testing facility. PARTICIPANTS: forty-eight healthy adults (aged 18-39). 
      INTERVENTIONS: Twelve hours of socially enriched or isolated environments in 
      extraverts and introverts prior to sleep deprivation. RESULTS: Social experience 
      interacted with personality type to affect alertness and vigilance. Social 
      enrichment, as compared with social impoverishment, was associated with more PVT 
      lapses at 04:00 overall. Similarly, following social enrichment, PVT speed was 
      significantly slower among extraverts than among introverts during sleep 
      deprivation, but no personality-group differences emerged following social 
      impoverishment. MWT sleep latency and SSS subjective sleepiness did not show 
      significant personality or social-condition effects during sleep deprivation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: the effect of social exposure on vulnerability or resiliency to 
      sleep deprivation was modulated by introversion and extraversion. Extraverts 
      exposed to social environments were more vulnerable to subsequent sleep 
      deprivation than were introverts.

TI  - Jigsaw Puzzles As Cognitive Enrichment (PACE) - the effect of solving jigsaw 
      puzzles on global visuospatial cognition in adults 50 years of age and older: 
      study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive disorders are an important societal challenge and the 
      need for early prevention is increasingly recognized. Meta-analyses show 
      beneficial effects of cognitive activities on cognition. However, high financial 
      costs, low intrinsic motivation, logistic challenges of group-based activities, 
      or the need to operate digital devices prevent their widespread application in 
      clinical practice. Solving jigsaw puzzles is a cognitive activity without these 
      hindering characteristics, but cognitive effects have not been investigated yet. 
      With this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of solving jigsaw puzzles on 
      visuospatial cognition, daily functioning, and psychological outcomes. METHODS: 
      The pre-posttest, assessor-blinded study will include 100 cognitively healthy 
      adults 50 years of age or older, who will be randomly assigned to a jigsaw puzzle 
      group or a cognitive health counseling group. Within the 5-week intervention 
      period, participants in the jigsaw puzzle group will engage in 30 days of solving 
      jigsaw puzzles for at least 1 h per day and additionally receive cognitive health 
      counseling. The cognitive health counseling group will receive the same 
      counseling intervention but no jigsaw puzzles. The primary outcome, global 
      visuospatial cognition, will depict the average of the z-standardized performance 
      scores in visuospatial tests of perception, constructional praxis, mental 
      rotation, processing speed, flexibility, working memory, reasoning, and episodic 
      memory. As secondary outcomes, we will assess the eight cognitive abilities, 
      objective and subjective visuospatial daily functioning, psychological 
      well-being, general self-efficacy, and perceived stress. The primary data 
      analysis will be based on mixed-effects models in an intention-to-treat approach. 
      DISCUSSION: Solving jigsaw puzzles is a low-cost, intrinsically motivating, 
      cognitive leisure activity, which can be executed alone or with others and 
      without the need to operate a digital device. In the case of positive results, 
      these characteristics allow an easy implementation of solving jigsaw puzzles in 
      clinical practice as a way to improve visuospatial functioning. Whether cognitive 
      impairment and loss of independence in everyday functioning might be prevented or 
      delayed in the long run has to be examined in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Social skills intervention is an evidence-based practice for enhancing 
      communication and interpersonal skills in individuals with autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD). Participation in the Program for the Education and Enrichment of 
      Relational Skills (PEERS®), a manualized social skills intervention for 
      adolescents with ASD, is associated with improved social skills and peer 
      interactions, as well as decreased autism symptoms. Participation in PEERS® has 
      also been linked to increased parent self-efficacy and decreased family chaos. 
      The present study examined parenting stress in the context of PEERS®. Following 
      participation in PEERS®, parents reported lower levels of parenting stress 
      associated with adolescent mood and social isolation. These findings provide 
      further evidence of the family-wide benefits of adolescent-focused social skills 
      intervention.

AB  - Environmental conditions, such as stress and environmental enrichment (EE), 
      influence predisposition to alcohol use/abuse; however, the underlying mechanisms 
      remain unknown. To assess the effect of environmental conditions on the initial 
      rewarding effects of alcohol, we examined conditioned place-preference (CPP) to 
      alcohol following exposure to EE in mice. Since social context is a major factor 
      contributing to initial alcohol-drinking, we also assessed the impact of EE on 
      the levels of the "social neuropeptide" oxytocin (OT) and its receptor, OTR. 
      Finally, we assessed the effect of pharmacological manipulations of the 
      oxytocinergic system on EE-induced alcohol CPP. While EE increased sociability 
      and reduced anxiety-like behaviors, it caused a ∼3.5-fold increase in alcohol 
      reward compared to controls. EE triggered profound neuroadaptations of the 
      oxytocinergic system; it increased hypothalamic OT levels and decreased OTR 
      binding in the prefrontal cortex and olfactory nuclei of the brain. Repeated 
      administration of the OT analogue carbetocin (6.4 mg/kg/day) mimicked the 
      behavioral effects of EE on ethanol CPP and induced similar brain region-specific 
      alterations of OTR binding as those observed following EE. Conversely, repeated 
      administration of the OTR antagonist L,369-899 (5 mg/kg/day) during EE exposure, 
      but not during the acquisition of alcohol CPP, reversed the pronounced EE-induced 
      ethanol rewarding effect. These results demonstrate for the first time, a 
      stimulatory effect of environmental enrichment exposure on alcohol reward via an 
      oxytocinergic-dependent mechanism, which may predispose to alcohol abuse. This 
      study offers a unique prospective on the neurobiological understanding of the 
      initial stages of alcohol use/misuse driven by complex environmental-social 
      interplay.

TI  - Important issues in clinical practice: perspectives of oncology nurses.
PG  - 151-64
AB  - As the 1990's draw to a close, the cancer care environment is undergoing rapid 
      change. Many issues exist within the complex environment of cancer care that 
      could create a challenge in providing quality nursing care to patients. This 
      study examined the current challenges oncology nurses face in their daily 
      practice. Surveys were mailed to members of the Canadian Association of Nurses in 
      Oncology asking them to indicate on a list of 80 issues which were problems in 
      their daily practice. From the responses of 249 oncology nurses, the following 
      items were ranked as the top 10 problems: anxiety, coping/stress management, 
      bereavement/death, fatigue, metastatic disease, comfort, pain control and 
      management, quality of life, recurrence of primary cancer, and nurse burn-out. 
      Principal component analysis was conducted to determine if patterns existed in 
      the way problems had been rated. Five components explained 42% of the variance in 
      the data set: comprehensive cancer care, communication, experience of loss, 
      terminal illness, and signs and symptoms. Implications for nursing practice, 
      education and research are highlighted.

TI  - Blood-gene expression reveals reduced circadian rhythmicity in individuals 
      resistant to sleep deprivation.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To address whether changes in gene expression in blood cells 
      with sleep loss are different in individuals resistant and sensitive to sleep 
      deprivation. DESIGN: Blood draws every 4 h during a 3-day study: 24-h normal 
      baseline, 38 h of continuous wakefulness and subsequent recovery sleep, for a 
      total of 19 time-points per subject, with every 2-h psychomotor vigilance task 
      (PVT) assessment when awake. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen 
      subjects who were previously identified as behaviorally resistant (n = 7) or 
      sensitive (n = 7) to sleep deprivation by PVT. INTERVENTION: Thirty-eight hours 
      of continuous wakefulness. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We found 4,481 unique genes 
      with a significant 24-h diurnal rhythm during a normal sleep-wake cycle in blood 
      (false discovery rate [FDR] < 5%). Biological pathways were enriched for 
      biosynthetic processes during sleep. After accounting for circadian effects, two 
      genes (SREBF1 and CPT1A, both involved in lipid metabolism) exhibited small, but 
      significant, linear changes in expression with the duration of sleep deprivation 
      (FDR < 5%). The main change with sleep deprivation was a reduction in the 
      amplitude of the diurnal rhythm of expression of normally cycling probe sets. 
      This reduction was noticeably higher in behaviorally resistant subjects than 
      sensitive subjects, at any given P value. Furthermore, blood cell type enrichment 
      analysis showed that the expression pattern difference between sensitive and 
      resistant subjects is mainly found in cells of myeloid origin, such as monocytes. 
      CONCLUSION: Individual differences in behavioral effects of sleep deprivation are 
      associated with differences in diurnal amplitude of gene expression for genes 
      that show circadian rhythmicity.

TI  - Parent and family outcomes of PEERS: a social skills intervention for adolescents 
      with autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 752-65
LID - 10.1007/s10803-014-2231-6 [doi]
AB  - Raising a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with 
      increased family chaos and parent distress. Successful long-term treatment 
      outcomes are dependent on healthy systemic functioning, but the family impact of 
      treatment is rarely evaluated. The Program for the Education and Enrichment of 
      Relational Skills (PEERS) is a social skills intervention designed for 
      adolescents with high-functioning ASD. This study assessed the impact of PEERS on 
      family chaos, parenting stress, and parenting self-efficacy via a randomized, 
      controlled trial. Results suggested beneficial effects for the experimental group 
      in the domain of family chaos compared to the waitlist control, while parents in 
      the PEERS experimental group also demonstrated increased parenting self-efficacy. 
      These findings highlight adjunctive family system benefits of PEERS intervention 
      and suggest the need for overall better understanding of parent and family 
      outcomes of ASD interventions.

TI  - M6A RNA Methylation-Based Epitranscriptomic Modifications in Plasticity-Related 
      Genes via miR-124-C/EBPα-FTO-Transcriptional Axis in the Hippocampus of Learned 
      Helplessness Rats.
PG  - 1037-1049
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyac068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired synaptic plasticity has been linked to dynamic gene 
      regulatory network changes. Recently, gene regulation has been introduced with 
      the emerging concept of unique N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-based reversible 
      transcript methylation. In this study, we tested whether m6A RNA methylation may 
      potentially serve as a link between the stressful insults and altered expression 
      of plasticity-related genes. METHODS: Expression of plasticity genes Nr3c1, 
      Creb1, Ntrk2; m6A-modifying enzymes Fto, methyltransferase like (Mettl)-3 and 14; 
      DNA methylation enzymes Dnmt1, Dnmt3a; transcription factor C/ebp-α; and 
      miRNA-124-3p were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 
      the hippocampus of rats that showed susceptibility to develop stress-induced 
      depression (learned helplessness). M6A methylation of plasticity-related genes 
      was determined following m6A mRNA immunoprecipitation. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation was used to examine the endogenous binding of C/EBP-α to the 
      Fto promoter. MiR-124-mediated post-transcriptional inhibition of Fto via C/EBPα 
      was determined using an in vitro model. RESULTS: Hippocampus of learned 
      helplessness rats showed downregulation of Nr3c1, Creb1, and Ntrk2 along with 
      enrichment in their m6A methylation. A downregulation in demethylating enzyme Fto 
      and upregulation in methylating enzyme Mettl3 were also noted. The Fto promoter 
      was hypomethylated due to the lower expression of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a. At the same 
      time, there was a lower occupancy of transcription factor C/EBPα on the Fto 
      promoter. Conversely, C/ebp-α transcript was downregulated via induced miR-124-3p 
      expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study mechanistically linked defective 
      C/EBP-α-FTO-axis, epigenetically influenced by induced expression of miR-124-3p, 
      in modifying m6A enrichment in plasticity-related genes. This could potentially 
      be linked with abnormal neuronal plasticity in depression.

AB  - Aspects of the environment in which one lives are increasingly being recognized 
      as major contributors to health, yet few empirical studies have focused on mental 
      health. Therefore, we sought to determine if neighborhood characteristics were 
      associated with mental health outcomes among 1408 African-American (59.3%) and 
      white (40.7%) adults living in a socio-economically homogeneous, racially 
      integrated, urban community in Baltimore, MD. Among African Americans and whites, 
      the perception of severe problems in the community was associated with higher 
      levels of stress (approximately 1.8 units higher), anxiety (approximately 1.8 
      units higher), and depression (OR= approximately 2.0) compared to those who 
      perceived no or few problems (all p<0.05). Community cohesion, the perception 
      that people generally work together, was associated with better mental health 
      among whites only. These findings give further insight into the complex 
      environment of inner-city communities.

AB  - This study assessed the motivation of gestating sows housed in standard, barren 
      gestation stalls (used for breeding/implantation and/or gestation) for access to 
      environmental enrichment. Enrichment consisted of a cotton rope or rubber mat in 
      comparison to positive (additional food when fed at commercial levels) and 
      negative (empty trough) controls. Although environmental enrichment may improve 
      animal welfare, sows' valuation of enrichments is largely unknown. This study 
      used an operant panel and obtained behavioral measures to quantify motivation. As 
      indicated by a higher price paid and lower latencies to press the panel and enter 
      the treatment stall (all comparisons, p < .05), sows demonstrated higher 
      motivation for food compared with all treatments. Sows housed in gestation stalls 
      did not demonstrate high motivation via operant responding for a cotton rope or a 
      rubber mat; nor did they demonstrate any differences in behavioral measures (all 
      comparisons, p > .10). Although sows' motivation for a mat did not differ from 
      that for an empty trough, previous work has demonstrated the welfare benefits 
      associated with comfort flooring.

TI  - Phasic Treatment with Interferon Gamma Stimulates Release of Exosomes that 
      Protect Against Spreading Depression.
PG  - 795-807
LID - 10.1089/jir.2015.0010 [doi]
AB  - The detrimental effects of T-cell-secreted interferon gamma (IFNγ) on oxidative 
      stress (OS) and demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) are well recognized. 
      Recently, we demonstrated that IFNγ-mediated damage to myelin also increases 
      susceptibility to spreading depression (SD; the likely basis of migraine with 
      aura). However, before onset of MS, induction of physiological levels of IFNγ, 
      like that produced by environmental enrichment (EE), protects against 
      demyelination and OS. Accordingly, we focused on the potential for physiological 
      levels of IFNγ to protect against SD. EE, which occurs with a moderate and phasic 
      increase in proinflammatory cytokines, reduces migraine frequency. Thus, we 
      applied phasic or pulsed IFNγ to brain slice cultures to emulate EE. This 
      treatment reduced OS, increased myelin basic protein, a marker for myelin, and 
      reduced susceptibility to SD. Building on our research on exosomes in EE-based 
      neuroprotection, we found that IFNγ stimulation of slice cultures induced release 
      of exosomes, likely from the microglia that produce the same protective effects 
      as IFNγ treatment when applied to naive cultures. Finally, nasal administration 
      of IFNγ to rats recapitulated in vitro effects, reducing OS, increasing myelin, 
      and reducing SD. These results support phasic IFNγ signaling as a therapeutic 
      target for prevention of SD and, by extension, migraine.

TI  - From unity to atonement: Some religious correlates of Hans Loewald's 
      developmental theory.
PG  - 699-716
AB  - Loewald's understanding of ego development offers a way to conceptualise, from a 
      psychoanalytic perspective, those aspects of religious experience that can 
      reflect or contribute to the enrichment of the ego, in contradistinction to the 
      defensive and regressive elements of religious experience that have been well 
      detailed in the psychoanalytic literature in the past. In Loewald's view, a 
      dynamic and metabolic interplay between ego and reality characterises the 
      developmental process. With increasing levels of internalisation, 
      differentiation, individuation and integration, ego and reality are restructured 
      into increasingly resilient and durable forms. An ongoing dialectical tension 
      between separation and reunion provides the driving force for development. 
      Loewald's emphasis on the synthetic rather than defensive aspects of ego 
      functioning forms the basis for his characterisation of sublimation as a 'genuine 
      appropriation' rather than a defence, thus opening up one way to understand 
      non-defensive aspects of religious experience from a psychoanalytic perspective. 
      In the course of this exploration of Loewald's view of ego development and its 
      implications for an understanding of religious experience, the author offers 
      perspectives on Freud's views of religion, on some extreme forms of religious 
      fundamentalism, and on the dynamics of 'mature' faith as illuminated by Loewald's 
      developmental theory.

AB  - Monozygotic (MZ) twin studies constitute a key resource for the dissection of 
      environmental and biological risk factors for human complex disorders. Given that 
      epigenetic differences accumulate throughout the lifespan, the assessment of MZ 
      twin pairs discordant for depression offers a genetically informative design to 
      explore DNA methylation while accounting for the typical confounders of the 
      field, shared by co-twins of a pair. In this review, we systematically evaluate 
      all twin studies published to date assessing DNA methylation in association with 
      depressive phenotypes. However, difficulty to recruit large numbers of MZ twin 
      pairs fails to provide enough sample size to develop genome-wide approaches. 
      Alternatively, region and pathway analysis revealed an enrichment for nervous 
      system related functions; likewise, evidence supports an accumulation of 
      methylation variability in affected subjects when compared to their co-twins. 
      Nevertheless, longitudinal studies incorporating known risk factors for 
      depression such as childhood trauma are required for understanding the role that 
      DNA methylation plays in the etiology of depression.

TI  - [Sequencing Analysis of miRNAs in Brain-Derived Exosomes of Adolescent Mice With 
      Depression-Like Behaviors].
PG  - 316-321
LID - 10.12182/20230360205 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in 
      brain-derived exosomes (BDEs) of adolescent mice with depression-like behavior. 
      METHODS: The experimental group consisted of susceptible adolescent mice exposed 
      to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), and sucrose preference test (SPT) and 
      open field test (OFT) were performed to evaluate their depression-like behaviors. 
      BDEs were extracted by ultracentrifugation (UC). The morphology, particle size, 
      and surface marker proteins of BDEs were examined by transmission electron 
      microscopy, nano-flow cytometry and Western blot. The expression of miRNA in BDEs 
      was evaluated by high-throughput RNA sequencing. GO enrichment analysis and KEGG 
      pathway enrichment analysis were carried out based on bioinformatics. RESULTS: 
      The particle size of BDEs ranged between 50 to 100 nm and they displayed a 
      typical disc-shaped vesicle structure. TSG101 and syntenin, the exosome-positive 
      proteins, were detected. In the BDEs of mice with depression-like behaviors 
      induced by CSDS, 13 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 4 miRNAs were 
      significantly downregulated. Go and KEGG analysis showed that differentially 
      expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, 
      axonal guidance, and hypoxic response. CONCLUSION: It was found in this study 
      that exosomal miRNAs in brain tissue might be involved in such biological 
      processes as insulin resistance, neuroplasticity, and hypoxic response, thereby 
      regulating brain functions and causing depression-like behaviors.

TI  - Behavioural despair in rats: a new model sensitive to antidepressant treatments.
PG  - 379-91
AB  - Rats when forced to swim in a cylinder from which they cannot escape will, after 
      an initial period of vigorous activity, adopt a characteristic immobile posture 
      which can be readily identified. Immobility was reduced by various clinically 
      effective antidepressant drugs at doses which otherwise decreased spontaneous 
      motor activity in an open field. Antidepressants could thus be distinguished from 
      psychostimulants which decreased immobility at doses which increased general 
      activity. Anxiolytic compounds did not affect immobility whereas major 
      tranquilisers enhanced it. Immobility was also reduced by electroconvulsive 
      shock, REM sleep deprivation and "enrichment" of the environment. It was 
      concluded that immobility reflects a state of lowered mood in the rat which is 
      selectively sensitive to antidepressant treatments. Positive findings with 
      atypical antidepressant drugs such as iprindole and mianserin suggest that the 
      method may be capable of discovering new antidepressants hitherto undetectable 
      with classical pharmacological tests.

TI  - Working and reference memory of pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) in a holeboard 
      spatial discrimination task: the influence of environmental enrichment.
PG  - 845-50
LID - 10.1007/s10071-013-0646-7 [doi]
AB  - Interest in cognitive research in pigs is increasing, but little is known about 
      the impact of environmental conditions on pigs' cognitive capabilities. The 
      present study investigated the effect of environmental enrichment on cognitive 
      performance of pigs in a holeboard spatial task, in which they had to 
      discriminate four baited buckets out of 16. Pigs (n = 32) were either housed in 
      stimulus-poor, barren pens, or in larger pens enriched with rooting substrates. 
      Pigs were subjected to 30 holeboard trials. Both working memory (WM), that is, 
      the ratio (baited visits/total number of (re)visits to baited buckets), and 
      reference memory (RM), that is, the ratio ((re)visits to baited buckets/total 
      number of visits to all buckets), improved over trials. WM scores were higher in 
      pigs from enriched pens than in pigs from barren pens. Housing did not affect RM 
      scores. Personality type of the pigs, as assessed early in life using a backtest, 
      did not affect WM or RM. In conclusion, housing conditions of pigs did not affect 
      reference memory, but environmental enrichment improved working memory of pigs in 
      a spatial discrimination task. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest 
      that cognitive functioning of pigs may be impaired under commonly used housing 
      conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of molecular brain changes associated with environmental stress in 
      rodent models compared to human major depressive disorder: A proteomic systems 
      approach.
PG  - S63-S74
LID - 10.1080/15622975.2016.1252465 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Rodent models of major depressive disorder (MDD) are indispensable 
      when screening for novel treatments, but assessing their translational relevance 
      with human brain pathology has proved difficult. METHODS: Using a novel systems 
      approach, proteomics data obtained from post-mortem MDD anterior prefrontal 
      cortex tissue (n = 12) and matched controls (n = 23) were compared with 
      equivalent data from three commonly used preclinical models exposed to 
      environmental stressors (chronic mild stress, prenatal stress and social defeat). 
      Functional pathophysiological features associated with depression-like behaviour 
      were identified in these models through enrichment of protein-protein interaction 
      networks. A cross-species comparison evaluated which model(s) represent human MDD 
      pathology most closely. RESULTS: Seven functional domains associated with MDD and 
      represented across at least two models such as "carbohydrate metabolism and 
      cellular respiration" were identified. Through statistical evaluation using 
      kernel-based machine learning techniques, the social defeat model was found to 
      represent MDD brain changes most closely for four of the seven domains. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to apply a method for directly evaluating 
      the relevance of the molecular pathology of multiple animal models to human MDD 
      on the functional level. The methodology and findings outlined here could help to 
      overcome translational obstacles of preclinical psychiatric research.

TI  - [From stressful life events to anxiety disorders].
PG  - S11-3
AB  - Stress is usually defined on the basis of the consequences observed after a 
      threatening environmental change. This type of definition is mainly attributable 
      to Seyle who conceived stress reaction as a final pathway, related to numerous 
      aggressions against physical or psychological integrity, and threatening 
      homeostasis. On the other hand, different authors showed that aggression does not 
      systematically leads to retroactive undoing, as some types of environmental 
      modifications can provoke an increase of knowledge, enriching both coping style 
      and adaptative processes. Life events can be considered as a neurohormonal 
      activation following action, the activation process being strictly dependent on 
      the suddenness and unexpectedness of the event. "Normal" (at times necessary) 
      stress, allowing the adaptative and sometimes survival processes, has thus to be 
      distinguished from pathological stress, which provokes suffering. Stressful life 
      event is modifying the environment, and the subject has to mobilize all his 
      capacity, specificity and defense style in order to cope with the new situation. 
      In this view, stressful life events may provoke enrichment and reinforcement for 
      some and severe anxious disorders for others. Numerous factors are involved in 
      the deleterious effect of a stressful life event, explaining why the modalities 
      of the answer are so dramatically variable between different subjects.

TI  - Implications of criminal career research for the prevention of offending.
PG  - 93-113
AB  - In the Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development, 411 London males have been 
      followed up from age 8 to age 32. Offending was only one element of a general 
      syndrome of antisocial behaviour, which showed significant continuity from 
      childhood to adulthood. The most important childhood (age 8-11) predictors of 
      offending up to age 32 were: socio-economic deprivation, poor parenting, family 
      deviance, school problems, hyperactivity-impulsivity-attention deficit, and 
      antisocial child behaviour. A theory was proposed to explain these results, 
      including criminal motivation, internalized beliefs about offending, and rational 
      decision-making. It was concluded that the most hopeful methods of preventing 
      offending were behavioural parent training and pre-school intellectual enrichment 
      programmes.

AB  - An attempt was made to socialize unrelated and unfamiliar adult rhesus monkey 
      females that had lived in single cages for more than one year. Partners first 
      were given the opportunity for noncontact familiarization in partitioned double 
      cages. They were then transferred into an ordinary double cage. Clear-cut rank 
      relationships were evident within the first 90 minutes of pair formation in 94% 
      (17/18) of dyads tested. Only 28% (5/18) of pairs resorted to fighting (in no 
      case with infliction of serious injury), while 50% (9/18) engaged in social 
      grooming or hugging during this initial phase of pair formation. Eighty-three 
      percent (15/18) of pairs were compatible, with none of the partners showing signs 
      of depression and none inflicting serious injury on the other. Seventeen percent 
      (3/18) of pairs were incompatible (two cases of depression, one serious tail 
      injury) and were separated. It was concluded that the barren environment of 
      singly caged rhesus monkey females can be enriched with little risk by carefully 
      making them compatible companions.

TI  - Stereospecific determination of citalopram and desmethylcitalopram by capillary 
      electrophoresis and liquid-phase microextraction.
PG  - 263-73
AB  - A chiral capillary electrophoresis (CE) system allowing simultaneous enantiomer 
      determination of citalopram (CIT) and its pharmacologically active metabolite 
      desmethylcitalopram (DCIT) was developed. Excellent chiral separation was 
      obtained using 1% sulfated-beta-cyclodextrin (S-beta-CD) as chiral selector in 
      combination with 12% ACN in 25 mM phosphate pH 2.5. Samples were prepared by 
      liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) based on a rodlike porous polypropylene 
      hollow fibre. CIT and DCIT were extracted from 1 ml plasma made alkaline with 
      NaOH, into dodecyl acetate impregnated in the pores of a hollow fibre, and into 
      20 mM phosphate pH 2.75, inside the hollow fibre. The acceptor solution was 
      directly compatible with the CE system. Efficient sample clean-up was seen, and 
      the recoveries were 46 and 29% for the enantiomers of CIT and DCIT, respectively, 
      corresponding to 31 and 19 times enrichment. The limit of quantification (S/N=10) 
      was <11.2 ng/ml, intra-day precision was <12.8% RSD, and inter-day precision was 
      <14.5% RSD, for all enantiomers. The validated method was successfully applied to 
      simultaneous determination of enantiomer concentrations of CIT and DCIT in plasma 
      samples from nine patients treated with racemic citalopram. The results confirm 
      LPME-CE as a suitable and promising tool for enantiomeric determination of chiral 
      drugs and metabolites in biological matrices.

TI  - Antidepressant Mechanism Research of Acupuncture: Insights from a Genome-Wide

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic disease that adversely affects mood 
      and cognition. In this study, we randomly divided the rats into control group 
      (C), model group (M), fluoxetine group (F), and acupuncture group (A), used 
      open-field test to ascertain whether acupuncture affects chronic restraint stress 
      (CRS) induced depression-like behaviors of rats, and explored the antidepressant 
      mechanism of acupuncture at the molecular level of transcriptome in the frontal 
      cortex of CRS rats by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). According to differentially 
      expressed genes (DEG) analysis, we identified 134, 46, and 89 response genes 
      differentially expressed in C versus M, F versus M, and A versus M, respectively. 
      Through Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, we identified the gene sets 
      involved in extracellular space, inflammatory response, Toll-like receptor 
      signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. In 
      this study, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the frontal cortex 
      genome-wide transcriptomes in depression rats under CRS, which suggested that the 
      antidepressant effect of acupuncture is effective and has a multitarget 
      characteristic, which may be related to amino acid metabolism and inflammatory 
      pathways, especially the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling 
      pathway, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

TI  - Developing a scholarship community.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the results of a multidisciplinary, interinstitutional writing 
      support group established to facilitate faculty scholarly productivity. 
      ORGANIZING CONCEPT: The road to scholarship can be filled with many obstacles, 
      among them time constraints, teaching and meeting demands, student needs, office 
      interruptions, and lack of colleagueship. The problems associated with lack of 
      colleagueship, in particular, can be compounded for faculty who work in isolated 
      contexts with few, if any, senior faculty to serve as mentors. METHODS OF 
      DEVELOPMENT: The Western Writers Coercion Group evolved over a 2-year period from 
      a small group of nursing faculty at a single institution to include, by its 
      second year, 21 faculty from five western university campuses and three academic 
      disciplines. The group met biweekly via teleconference with the objectives of 
      defining and accomplishing realistic individual scholarship goals and providing a 
      forum for the critical exchange of ideas. RESULTS: The ongoing support and 
      mentoring of the group led to significant writing outcomes in the form of 
      manuscripts submitted for publication, abstracts submitted for conference 
      presentation, grant proposals developed, and collegial relationships formed. 
      DISCUSSION: Although the benefits of group participation varied somewhat for 
      faculty at different points in the career trajectory, they seemed to accrue at 
      all levels of development. Group members underscored the many less quantifiable 
      advantages of group participation: exposure to broader professional perspectives, 
      the formation of key professional relationships, the enrichment of 
      multidisciplinary input, and individualized assistance with time management, goal 
      setting, and actual drafts. CONCLUSIONS: The structure and experience of this 
      group, which continues to meet regularly, might be a model to guide other groups 
      of scholars who face geographic isolation and who struggle with balancing time 
      and work and finding motivation for the process of writing.

TI  - Epigenetic Aging in Major Depressive Disorder.
PG  - 774-782
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17060595 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder is associated with an increased risk of 
      mortality and aging-related diseases. The authors examined whether major 
      depression is associated with higher epigenetic aging in blood as measured by DNA 
      methylation (DNAm) patterns, whether clinical characteristics of major depression 
      have a further impact on these patterns, and whether the findings replicate in 
      brain tissue. METHOD: DNAm age was estimated using all methylation sites in blood 
      of 811 depressed patients and 319 control subjects with no lifetime psychiatric 
      disorders and low depressive symptoms from the Netherlands Study of Depression 
      and Anxiety. The residuals of the DNAm age estimates regressed on chronological 
      age were calculated to indicate epigenetic aging. Major depression diagnosis and 
      clinical characteristics were assessed with questionnaires and psychiatric 
      interviews. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, 
      lifestyle, and health status. Postmortem brain samples of 74 depressed patients 
      and 64 control subjects were used for replication. Pathway enrichment analysis 
      was conducted using ConsensusPathDB to gain insight into the biological processes 
      underlying epigenetic aging in blood and brain. RESULTS: Significantly higher 
      epigenetic aging was observed in patients with major depression compared with 
      control subjects (Cohen's d=0.18), with a significant dose effect with increasing 
      symptom severity in the overall sample. In the depression group, epigenetic aging 
      was positively and significantly associated with childhood trauma score. The 
      case-control difference was replicated in an independent data set of postmortem 
      brain samples. The top significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms included 
      neuronal processes. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with control subjects, patients with 
      major depression exhibited higher epigenetic aging in blood and brain tissue, 
      suggesting that they are biologically older than their corresponding 
      chronological age. This effect was even more profound in the presence of 
      childhood trauma.

TI  - Handling has an anxiolytic effect that is not affected by the inhibition of the 
      protein kinase C pathway in adult prenatal undernourished male rat offspring.
PG  - 46-53
LID - 10.1111/cga.12332 [doi]
AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) after birth has been reported as an intervention 
      improving the anxiety-like behavior and cognitive deficit due to maternal 
      restraint, foot-shock, or social stress during pregnancy. However, it remains 
      unclear whether EE after birth could benefit the early prenatal undernourished 
      offspring. In this study, we examined the effect of daily handling as a simple EE 
      intervention on the aberrant behavior of prenatally undernourished rats. The male 
      rat offspring exhibited anxiety-like behavior at 9 weeks of age due to maternal 
      food restriction in early pregnancy. Our study shows that the daily handling 
      after weaning has an anxiolytic effect in the prenatally undernourished offspring 
      without affecting the behavior of prenatally well-nourished offspring. 
      Conversely, the concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and their 
      metabolites were not altered in the prefrontal cortex by prenatal undernutrition 
      or daily handling after weaning. We investigated whether the anxiolytic effect of 
      daily handling was mediated by the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway using the PKC 
      inhibitor, chelerythrine. The anxiolytic effect of the handling was not canceled 
      by chelerythrine injection in prenatally undernourished offspring, whereas 
      chelerythrine induced an anxiety-like behavior in control rats. Our results 
      suggest that maternal undernutrition in early pregnancy induces an anxiety-like 
      behavior accompanied with a PKC pathway-hyporesponsiveness; however, daily 
      handling ameliorates the anxiety-like behavior through a PKC-independent pathway.

TI  - Molecular-level effects of acupuncture on depression: a genome-wide transcriptome 
      analysis of pituitary gland in rats exposed to chronic restraint stress.
PG  - 486-495
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antidepressant mechanism of acupuncture at the 
      molecular level in the pituitary gland of rats exposed to chronic restraint 
      stress (CRS). METHODS: Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into a control 
      group (C), model group (M), fluoxetine group (F), and acupuncture group (A). CRS 
      was induced in the model group by restraining rats for 28 days. Groups F and A 
      were given fluoxetine administration and acupuncture intervention, respectively, 
      1 h before the CRS procedures were implemented. On the 29th day, rat pituitary 
      glands were harvested for RNA extraction and RNA-sequencing analysis. RESULTS: 
      Differentially expressed gene analysis identified 148, 87, and 179 response genes 
      differentially expressed in group C vs group M, group F vs group M, and group A 
      vs group M, respectively. Using Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis, we identified the 
      up-regulation of gene sets involved in extracellular space, receptor binding, and 
      monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism, and the down-regulation of gene sets 
      involved in immune response and inflammatory response as the prevailing 
      transcriptomic signatures in the pituitary gland of rats treated with CRS, 
      fluoxetine, or acupuncture. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that acupuncture has 
      a multitarget antidepressant effect at the molecular and behavioral levels.

TI  - Does environmental enrichment reduce stress? An integrated measure of 
      corticosterone from feathers provides a novel perspective.
PG  - e17663
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0017663 [doi]
LID - e17663
AB  - Enrichment is widely used as tool for managing fearfulness, undesirable 
      behaviors, and stress in captive animals, and for studying exploration and 
      personality. Inconsistencies in previous studies of physiological and behavioral 
      responses to enrichment led us to hypothesize that enrichment and its removal are 
      stressful environmental changes to which the hormone corticosterone and 
      fearfulness, activity, and exploration behaviors ought to be sensitive. We 
      conducted two experiments with a captive population of wild-caught Clark's 
      nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) to assess responses to short- (10-d) and 
      long-term (3-mo) enrichment, their removal, and the influence of novelty, within 
      the same animal. Variation in an integrated measure of corticosterone from 
      feathers, combined with video recordings of behaviors, suggests that how 
      individuals perceive enrichment and its removal depends on the duration of 
      exposure. Short- and long-term enrichment elicited different physiological 
      responses, with the former acting as a stressor and birds exhibiting acclimation 
      to the latter. Non-novel enrichment evoked the strongest corticosterone responses 
      of all the treatments, suggesting that the second exposure to the same objects 
      acted as a physiological cue, and that acclimation was overridden by negative 
      past experience. Birds showed weak behavioral responses that were not related to 
      corticosterone. By demonstrating that an integrated measure of glucocorticoid 
      physiology varies significantly with changes to enrichment in the absence of 
      agonistic interactions, our study sheds light on potential mechanisms driving 
      physiological and behavioral responses to environmental change.

TI  - Effects of Housing System on Anxiety, Chronic Stress, Fear, and Immune Function 
      in Bovan Brown Laying Hens.
LID - 10.3390/ani12141803 [doi]
LID - 1803
AB  - The scientific community needs objective measures to appropriately assess animal 
      welfare. The study objective was to assess the impact of housing system on novel 
      physiological and behavioral measurements of animal welfare for laying hens, 
      including secretory and plasma Immunoglobulin (IgA; immune function), feather 
      corticosterone (chronic stress), and attention bias testing (ABT; anxiety), in 
      addition to the well-validated tonic immobility test (TI; fearfulness). To test 
      this, 184 Bovan brown hens were housed in 28 conventional cages (3 birds/cage) 
      and 4 enriched pens (25 birds/pen). Feces, blood, and feathers were collected 4 
      times between week 22 and 43 to quantify secretory and plasma IgA and feather 
      corticosterone concentrations. TI tests and ABT were performed once. Hens that 
      were from cages tended to show longer TI, had increased feather corticosterone, 
      and decreased secretory IgA at 22 weeks of age. The caged hens fed quicker, and 
      more hens fed during the ABT compared to the penned hens. Hens that were in 
      conventional cages showed somewhat poorer welfare outcomes than the hens in 
      enriched pens, as indicated by increased chronic stress, decreased immune 
      function at 22 weeks of age but no other ages, somewhat increased fear, but 
      reduced anxiety. Overall, these novel markers show some appropriate contrast 
      between housing treatments and may be useful in an animal welfare assessment 
      context for laying hens. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Post-weaning Environmental Enrichment in Male CD-1 Mice: Impact on Social 
      Behaviors, Corticosterone Levels and Prefrontal Cytokine Expression in Adulthood.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00145 [doi]
LID - 145
AB  - Environmental enrichment is typically associated with enhanced well-being, 
      improved cognitive function and stress resilience. However, in some instances 
      grouping adult male mice in enriched conditions promoted a stressful environment, 
      which resulted in elevated endocrine, monoamine and inflammatory outcomes in 
      response to subsequent stressor exposure. The current investigation examined 
      whether raising male mice in an enriched environment (EE) would modulate social 
      and anxiety-like behaviors in early adulthood and influence brain expression of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). 
      Immediately after weaning (postnatal day [PD] 21), CD-1 male mice were housed 
      with their siblings (3/cage) for 6 weeks in an EE or a standard (SE) environment. 
      Body weights and aggressive interactions were monitored weekly. Social avoidance 
      behaviors in the social interaction test and anxiety-like behaviors in the 
      elevated-plus maze were examined in early adulthood. Ninety minutes following the 
      behavioral tests, mice were sacrificed and a blood sample and the prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) were collected for the determination of plasma corticosterone levels 
      as well as cytokine and BDNF mRNA expression. Mice raised in an EE exhibited more 
      wounds and gained less weight than mice housed in a SE. Enriched mice also spent 
      a greater amount of time in proximity of a social target in the social 
      interaction test and made fewer transitions into the closed arms of the 
      elevated-plus maze. Interestingly, the elevated plasma corticosterone and 
      upregulated prefrontal interleukin (IL)-1β expression observed after the social 
      interaction test among the SE mice were not apparent among those housed in an EE. 
      Enrichment also increased prefrontal BDNF expression, especially among mice that 
      experienced the social interaction test. These results suggest that although 
      raising male mice in an EE may elicit aggressive interactions between sibling 
      cage-mates (as indicated by a high number of wounds), this environment also 
      enhances social behaviors and limits the corticosterone and cytokine impacts of 
      mild social stressors encountered in early adulthood.

TI  - Behavioral and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Early Interventions in Adult Wistar 
      Rats.
PG  - 137-145
LID - 10.29399/npa.24943 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interventions performed in the early period of life are associated 
      with cognitive and behavioral changes in adulthood. The effects of interventions 
      such as exposure to an early stressful life event or environmental enrichment on 
      cognitive and behavioral development are studied. The aim of this study is to 
      develop a new intervention method, to investigate the effects of early 
      interventions on social interaction, memory anxiety levels and NR2B levels in 
      prefrontal and hippocampus in adulthood. The hypothesis of the study is that 
      exposure to the ambivalent mother will affect the behavioral performance of rats 
      at least as much as one hour apart from the mother in the adult period and cause 
      changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the NR2B levels. METHOD: In 
      the study, the Wistar rats were divided into four groups as control group (12), 
      group that remained 15 minutes apart from mother (Mild Stress) (12), group that 
      remained 60 minutes apart from mother (Severe Stress) (14) and ambivalent mother 
      group (13). In adulthood, the social interaction test, elevated plus maze and new 
      object recognition test performances of rats were evaluated. ELISA method was 
      used to evaluate the effect of interventions on the prefrontal cortex and 
      hippocampus NMDA R2B levels. RESULTS: The important findings of the study were 
      that in the new object recognition test, separation from the mother did not 
      affect the recognition memory regardless of gender, while the short-term 
      recognition memory of the females of the ambivalent mothers' group was better 
      than the females in the other groups and the long-term memory performance of the 
      mild stress groups men was better than the man in the other groups. In addition, 
      in the social interaction test, the males of the ambivalent group and the mild 
      stress group showed more aggressive behavior. It was determined that the 
      prefrontal cortex NR2B level was higher in the mild stress and ambivalent mother 
      group compared to the severe stress group, and NR2B level was increased in all 
      intervention groups compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the 
      hypothesis, the results of this study support that the ambivalent mother's group 
      rats are not more adversely affected than the severe group rats and that the 
      model created may be an environmental enrichment model rather than an early 
      stressful life event exposure.

TI  - Effects of Environmental Enrichment on Doublecortin and BDNF Expression along the 
      Dorso-Ventral Axis of the Dentate Gyrus.
PG  - 488
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2017.00488 [doi]
LID - 488
AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the dentate gyrus is known to respond to 
      environmental enrichment, chronic stress, and many other factors. The function of 
      AHN may vary across the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, as different 
      subdivisions are responsible for different functions. The dorsal pole regulates 
      cognitive-related behaviors, while the ventral pole mediates mood-related 
      responses through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In this study, 
      we investigate different methods of quantifying the effect of environmental 
      enrichment on AHN in the dorsal and ventral parts of the dentate gyrus (dDG and 
      vDG). To this purpose, 11-week-old female CD-1 mice were assigned for 8 days to 
      one of two conditions: the Environmental Enrichment (E) group received (i) 
      running wheels, (ii) larger cages, (iii) plastic tunnels, and (iv) bedding with 
      male urine, while the Control (C) group received standard housing. Dorsal CA 
      (Cornu Ammonis) and DG regions were larger in the E than the C animals. Distance 
      run linearly predicted the volume of the dorsal hippocampus, as well as of the 
      intermediate and ventral CA regions. In the dDG, the amount of Doublecortin (DCX) 
      immunoreactivity was significantly higher in E than in C mice. Surprisingly, this 
      pattern was the opposite in the vDG (C > E). Real-time PCR measurement of Dcx 
      mRNA and DCX protein analysis using ELISA showed the same pattern. Brain Derived 
      Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) immunoreactivity and mRNA displayed no difference 
      between E and C, suggesting that upregulation of DCX was not caused by changes in 
      BDNF levels. BDNF levels were higher in vDG than in dDG, as measured by both 
      methods. Bdnf expression in vDG correlated positively with the distance run by 
      individual E mice. The similarity in the patterns of immunoreactivity, mRNA and 
      protein for differential DCX expression and for BDNF distribution suggests that 
      the latter two methods might be effective tools for more rapid quantification of 
      AHN.

TI  - Evidence that emotion mediates social attention in rhesus macaques.
PG  - e44387
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0044387 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent work on non-human primates indicates that the allocation of 
      social attention is mediated by characteristics of the attending animal, such as 
      social status and genotype, as well as by the value of the target to which 
      attention is directed. Studies of humans indicate that an individual's emotion 
      state also plays a crucial role in mediating their social attention; for example, 
      individuals look for longer towards aggressive faces when they are feeling more 
      anxious, and this bias leads to increased negative arousal and distraction from 
      other ongoing tasks. To our knowledge, no studies have tested for an effect of 
      emotion state on allocation of social attention in any non-human species. 
      METHODOLOGY: We presented captive adult male rhesus macaques with pairs of adult 
      male conspecific face images - one with an aggressive expression, one with a 
      neutral expression - and recorded gaze towards these images. Each animal was 
      tested twice, once during a putatively stressful condition (i.e. following a 
      veterinary health check), and once during a neutral (or potentially positive) 
      condition (i.e. a period of environmental enrichment). Initial analyses revealed 
      that behavioural indicators of anxiety and stress were significantly higher after 
      the health check than during enrichment, indicating that the former caused a 
      negative shift in emotional state. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The macaques showed 
      initial vigilance for aggressive faces across both conditions, but subsequent 
      responses differed between conditions. Following the health check, initial 
      vigilance was followed by rapid and sustained avoidance of aggressive faces. By 
      contrast, during the period of enrichment, the macaques showed sustained 
      attention towards the same aggressive faces. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data 
      provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that shifts in emotion state 
      mediate social attention towards and away from facial cues of emotion in a 
      non-human animal. This work provides novel insights into the evolution of 
      emotion-attention interactions in humans, and mechanisms of social behaviour in 
      non-human primates, and may have important implications for understanding animal 
      psychological wellbeing.

TI  - Wfs1 and Related Molecules as Key Candidate Genes in the Hippocampus of 
      Depression.
PG  - 589370
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2020.589370 [doi]
LID - 589370
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent mental disorder, which is difficult to 
      diagnose and treat due to its unclear pathogenic mechanisms. The discovery of 
      novel and effective therapeutic targets for depression is urgently needed. The 
      hippocampus is a crucial region involved in depression and has been a therapeutic 
      target for many antidepressants. Thus, it is beneficial for comprehensive 
      research to be carried out on the molecular mechanisms of the hippocampus 
      involved in the pathogenesis of depression. This study aims to investigate the 
      differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the hippocampus in a chronic 
      unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model. METHOD: The study obtained GSE84183 
      from the GEO database. The R language screened the differential expression genes 
      (DEG) in the hippocampus tissue of depressed mice, and the enrichment pathways of 
      DEGs were analyzed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed 
      in the STRING database and visualized in Cytoscape software. MicroRNAs for these 
      DEGs were obtained from TarBase and mortar base databases, and transcription 
      factors (TF) related to DEG were predicted from the ENCODE database. Both 
      networks used the visual analysis platform NetworkAnalyst. Finally, the 
      microRNA-TF network was integrated based on the above two networks and imported 
      into Cytoscape for further analysis. RESULTS: This study screened 325 
      differentially expressed genes, containing 42 downregulated genes and 283 
      upregulated genes. Most of these genes are enriched in the cell cycle and the 
      chemokine signaling pathway. Meanwhile, Wfs1, one of the top ten DEGs, was 
      identified as the key regulator of the cell cycle and the participator in the 
      highest number of modules screened out in PPI networks. Wfs1-related molecules, 
      including UBTF, mmu-mir-17-5p, and mmu-mir-7b-5p, were therefore screened out. 
      Furthermore, we confirmed the downregulation of Wfs1 and upregulation of 
      UBTF/mmu-mir-17-5p/mmu-mir-7b-5p in the hippocampus of the CUMS mouse model. Our 
      data indicate that Wfs1 and related molecules were predicted to be associated 
      with the pathological process of depression. This research provided potential new 
      molecular targets of stress-induced depression.

TI  - An investigation into the use of music as potential auditory enrichment for 
      moloch gibbons (Hylobates moloch).
PG  - 423-6
LID - 10.1002/zoo.21074 [doi]
AB  - The use of music as enrichment has rarely been explored in zoos, despite evidence 
      that music has a positive effect on a range of laboratory housed animals. In this 
      study of moloch gibbons, Hylobates moloch, at Howletts Wild Animal Park (Kent, 
      England), instrumental classical music was played to eight individuals in two 
      family groups. Music was played 7 hr a day during three of six study weeks for 
      each group, alternating with control weeks in which no music was played. In focal 
      watches, data were recorded on a measure of activity, brachiation, and on two 
      rates of affiliative behavior, giving and receiving grooming. In addition, to 
      assess potential impacts on emotional state, data were recorded on 
      self-scratching and self-grooming, two widely used indices of anxiety or stress. 
      Analyses were carried out for each individual separately, as previous studies of 
      primates indicate animals may differ in their response to enrichment. Results 
      revealed little evidence for effects of music on gibbons' behavior. During the 
      music compared to control weeks, the adult male from one group showed higher 
      rates of self-scratching and higher durations of both self-grooming and grooming 
      others. The adult female from the same group was groomed more during the music 
      weeks than control weeks. For the six other animals, no significant differences 
      in behaviors were seen between music and control conditions. Our findings suggest 
      music may not be an effective enrichment for captive gibbons, and further 
      highlight the importance of considering individual differences when assessing the 
      effects of potential enrichment.

AB  - Therapeutic sleep deprivation (SD) rapidly induces robust, transient 
      antidepressant effects in a large proportion of major mood disorder patients 
      suffering from a depressive episode, but underlying biological factors remain 
      poorly understood. Research suggests that these patients may have altered 
      circadian molecular genetic 'clocks' and that SD functions through 'resetting' 
      dysregulated genes; additional factors may be involved, warranting further 
      investigation. Leveraging advances in microarray technology enabling the 
      transcriptome-wide assessment of gene expression, this study aimed to examine 
      gene expression changes accompanying SD and recovery sleep in patients suffering 
      from an episode of depression. Patients (N = 78) and controls (N = 15) underwent 
      SD, with blood taken at the same time of day before SD, after one night of SD and 
      after recovery sleep. A transcriptome-wide gene-by-gene approach was used, with a 
      targeted look also taken at circadian genes. Furthermore, gene set enrichment, 
      and longitudinal gene set analyses including the time point after recovery sleep, 
      were conducted. Circadian genes were significantly affected by SD, with patterns 
      suggesting that molecular clocks of responders and non-responders, as well as 
      patients and controls respond differently to chronobiologic stimuli. Notably, 
      gene set analyses revealed a strong widespread effect of SD on pathways involved 
      in immune function and inflammatory response, such as those involved in cytokine 
      and especially in interleukin signalling. Longitudinal gene set analyses showed 
      that in responders these pathways were upregulated after SD; in non-responders, 
      little response was observed. Our findings emphasize the close relationship 
      between circadian, immune and sleep systems and their link to etiology of 
      depression at the transcriptomic level.

TI  - MicroRNAs regulate survival in oxygen-deprived environments.
LID - jeb190579 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.190579 [doi]
AB  - Some animals must endure prolonged periods of oxygen deprivation to survive. One 
      such extreme model is the northern crayfish (Orconectes virilis), that regularly 
      survives year-round hypoxic and anoxic stresses in its warm stagnant summer 
      waters and in its cold, ice-locked winter waters. To elucidate the molecular 
      underpinnings of anoxia resistance in this natural model, we surveyed the 
      expression profiles of 76 highly conserved microRNAs in crayfish hepatopancreas 
      and tail muscle from normoxic, acute 2 h anoxia, and chronic 20 h anoxia 
      exposures. MicroRNAs are known to regulate a diverse array of cellular functions 
      required for environmental stress adaptations, and here we explored their role in 
      anoxia tolerance. The tissue-specific anoxia responses observed herein, with 22 
      anoxia-responsive microRNAs in the hepatopancreas and only four in muscle, 
      suggest that microRNAs facilitate a reprioritization of resources to preserve 
      crucial organ functions. Bioinformatic microRNA target enrichment analysis 
      predicted that the anoxia-downregulated microRNAs in hepatopancreas targeted 
      Hippo signalling, suggesting that cell proliferation and apoptotic signalling are 
      highly regulated in this liver-like organ during anoxia. Compellingly, 
      miR-125-5p, miR-33-5p and miR-190-5p, all known to target the master regulator of 
      oxygen deprivation responses HIF1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1), were anoxia 
      downregulated in the hepatopancreas. The anoxia-increased transcript levels of 
      the oxygen-dependent subunit HIF1α highlight a potential critical role for 
      miRNA-HIF targeting in facilitating a successful anoxia response. Studying the 
      cytoprotective mechanisms in place to protect against the challenges associated 
      with surviving in oxygen-poor environments is critical to elucidating the vast 
      and substantial role of microRNAs in the regulation of metabolism and stress in 
      aquatic invertebrates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Context fear memory dysregulation is a hallmark symptom of several 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and 
      posttraumatic stress disorder. The hippocampus (HC) and prelimbic (PrL) subregion 
      of the medial prefrontal cortex have been linked with context fear memory 
      retrieval in rodents, but the mechanisms by which HC-PrL circuitry regulates this 
      process remain poorly understood. METHODS: Spatial and genetic targeting of 
      HC-PrL circuitry was used for RNA sequencing (n = 31), chemogenetic stimulation 
      (n = 44), in vivo calcium imaging (n = 20), ex vivo electrophysiology (n = 8), 
      and molecular regulation of plasticity cascades during fear behavior (context 
      fear retrieval) (n = 16). RESULTS: We showed that ventral HC (vHC) neurons with 
      projections to the PrL cortex (vHC-PrL projectors) are a transcriptomically 
      distinct subpopulation compared with adjacent nonprojecting neurons, and we 
      showed complementary enrichment for diverse neuronal processes and central 
      nervous system-related clinical gene sets. We further showed that stimulation of 
      this population of vHC-PrL projectors suppresses context fear memory retrieval 
      and impairs the ability of PrL neurons to dynamically distinguish between 
      distinct phases of fear learning. Using transgenic and circuit-specific molecular 
      targeting approaches, we demonstrated that unique patterns of activity-dependent 
      gene transcription associated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling 
      within vHC-PrL projectors causally regulated activity in excitatory and 
      inhibitory PrL neurons during context fear memory retrieval. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Together, our data show that activity-dependent brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      release from molecularly distinct vHC-PrL projection neurons modulates 
      postsynaptic signaling in both inhibitory and excitatory PrL neurons, modifying 
      activity in discrete populations of PrL neurons to suppress freezing during 
      context fear memory retrieval.

AB  - One concern of the Anthropocene is the effects of human activities on animal 
      welfare, revealing the urgency to mitigate impacts of rearing environments. Body 
      tactile stimulation (TS), like massage therapy, has emerged as an enrichment 
      method to counteract stress and anxiety in vertebrates. In the current study, we 
      evaluated the effects of long-term TS on four-member groups of male Nile tilapia, 
      a worldwide reared species whose socially aggressive behavior is an essential 
      source of stress. We placed a rectangular PVC frame fitted with vertical plastic 
      sticks sided with silicone bristles in the center of aquarium to enable the fish 
      to receive body TS when passing through the bristles. A similar apparatus without 
      bristles was used as the control. Fish subjected to TS for 21 days showed a 
      gradual lowering of overt fights over time, but with no reduction in cortisol or 
      androgen levels. Nevertheless, TS improved the specific growth rate, maintained 
      balanced length/weight gain, and increased feed efficiency, probably owing to the 
      lowered energy expenditure during fights. Thus, we show for the first time that 
      long-term TS provided by a simple device can be used as a tool to improve the 
      welfare and productive performance of territorial fish.

AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and highly prevalent 
      psychiatric disorder, more common in females than in males and with notable 
      differences in presentation between genders. Recent studies have shown that 
      epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may modulate gene × environment 
      interactions and impact on neurodevelopment. We conducted an epigenome wide study 
      (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k beadchip) in a group of BPD patients with 
      (N = 49) and without (N = 47) childhood traumas and in a control group (N = 44). 
      Results were confirmed in a replication cohort (N = 293 BPD patients and N = 114 
      controls) using EpiTYPER assays. Differentially methylated CpG sites were 
      observed in several genes and intragenic regions in the X chromosome (PQBP1, 
      ZNF41, RPL10, cg07810091 and cg24395855) and in chromosome 6 (TAP2). BPD patients 
      showed significantly lower methylation levels in these CpG sites than healthy 
      controls. These differences seemed to be increased by the existence of childhood 
      trauma. Comparisons between BPD patients with childhood trauma and patients and 
      controls without revealed significant differences in four genes (POU5F1, GGT6, 
      TNFRSF13C and FAM113B), none of them in the X chromosome. Gene set enrichment 
      analyses revealed that epigenetic alterations were more frequently found in genes 
      controlling oestrogen regulation, neurogenesis and cell differentiation. These 
      results suggest that epigenetic alterations in the X chromosome and 
      oestrogen-regulation genes may contribute to the development of BPD and explain 
      the differences in presentation between genders. Furthermore, childhood trauma 
      events may modulate the magnitude of the epigenetic alterations contributing to 
      BPD.

AB  - Curiosity-the motivation to seek out information-has been studied widely across 
      the animal kingdom. To investigate curiosity in zebrafish we presented 30 novel 
      objects to groups of zebrafish housed in semi-naturalistic tanks (6 tanks; 10 
      fish/tank; 10-min presentations). During the first 100 s and final 100 s of each 
      object's 10-min presentation period, we recorded each group's: (i) latency to 
      approach the object, (ii) attraction to the object, (iii) social dynamics: 
      agonistic behavior and group cohesion and coordination, and (iv) diving behavior, 
      a stress response in zebrafish. Comparing these behaviors to a 100 s baseline 
      period when no object was present, we tested for neophobia (avoidance of 
      novelty), neophilia (overall attraction to novelty), sustained interest 
      (prolonged attraction to at least some presentations), discriminant interest 
      (certain objects eliciting more attention than others), habituation (loss of 
      interest over time), and alterations to social and stress behaviors. Zebrafish 
      groups readily approached all objects (1 s median latency), were neophilic 
      throughout all object presentations, and showed systematic sustained interest 
      only for some object presentations at the beginning of the study (object 
      presentations 1-10). Over the course of the study, zebrafish also showed signs of 
      habituation such that by the final ten object presentations (21-30), there were 
      no signs of overall sustained interest. During the beginning of the study (object 
      presentations 1-10), we also found evidence for specific object-driven interest, 
      with object ID accounting for 11% of the variability in interest scores (p < 
      0.01), and object-driven interest corresponding to alterations in social 
      behavior: decreased aggression (p < 0.02), increased group cohesion (p < 0.02), 
      and increased group coordination (p < 0.05). By explicitly investigating 
      curiosity in fish, this work reveals that under certain conditions, zebrafish 
      voluntarily engage in cognitive stimulation opportunities. More work is needed to 
      clarify what types of information zebrafish find most rewarding and how long-term 
      exposure to such opportunities may affect fish welfare.

AB  - Epidemiologic studies recognize that trauma and posttraumatic stress are 
      associated with heightened suicidal behavior severity, yet examination of these 
      associations from a genetic perspective is limited. We performed a multivariate 
      gene-by-environment genome-wide interaction study (GEWIS) of suicidality in 
      123,633 individuals using a covariance matrix based on 26 environments related to 
      traumatic experiences, posttraumatic stress, social support, and socioeconomic 
      status. We discovered five suicidality risk loci, including the male-associated 
      rs2367967 (CWC22), which replicated in an independent cohort. All 
      GEWIS-significant loci exhibited interaction effects where at least 5% of the 
      sample had environmental profiles conferring opposite SNP effects from the 
      majority. We identified PTSD as a primary driving environment for GxE at 
      suicidality risk loci. The male suicidality GEWIS was enriched for three 
      middle-temporal-gyrus inhibitory neuron transcriptomic profiles: SCUBE- and 
      PVALB-expressing cells (β = 0.028, p = 3.74 × 10(-4)), OPRM1-expressing cells 
      (β = 0.030, p = 0.001), and SPAG17-expressing cells (β = 0.029, 
      p = 9.80 × 10(-4)). Combined with gene-based analyses (CNTN5 p (association) 
       = 2.38 × 10(-9), p (interaction)  = 1.51 × 10(-3); PSMD14 p (association) 
       = 2.04 × 10(-7), p (interaction)  = 7.76 × 10(-6); HEPACAM p (association) 
       = 2.43 × 10(-6), p (interaction)  = 3.82 × 10(-7)) including information about 
      brain chromatin interaction profiles (UBE2E3 in male neuron p = 1.07 × 10(-5)), 
      our GEWIS points to extracellular matrix biology and synaptic plasticity as 
      biological interactors with the effects of potentially modifiable lifetime 
      traumatic experiences on genetic risk for suicidality. Characterization of 
      molecular basis for the effects of traumatic experience and posttraumatic stress 
      on risk of suicidal behaviors may help to identify novel targets for which more 
      effective treatments can be developed for use in high-risk populations.

AB  - Whether microRNAs (miRNAs) from plasma exosomes might be dysregulated in patients 
      with depression, especially treatment-resistant depression (TRD), remains 
      unclear, based on study of which novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets could 
      be discovered. To this end, a small sample study was performed by isolation of 
      plasma exosomes from patients with TRD diagnosed by Hamilton scale. In this 
      study, 4 peripheral plasma samples from patients with TRD and 4 healthy controls 
      were collected for extraction of plasma exosomes. Exosomal miRNAs were analyzed 
      by miRNA sequencing, followed by image collection, expression difference 
      analysis, target gene GO enrichment analysis, and KEGG pathway enrichment 
      analysis. Compared with the healthy controls, 2 miRNAs in the plasma exosomes of 
      patients with TRD showed significant differences in expression, among which 
      has-miR-335-5p were significantly upregulated and has-miR-1292-3p were 
      significantly downregulated. Go and KEGG analysis showed that dysregulated miRNAs 
      affect postsynaptic density and axonogenesis as well as the signaling pathway of 
      axon formation and cell growths. The identification of these miRNAs and their 
      target genes may provide novel biomarkers for improving diagnosis accuracy and 
      treatment effectiveness of TRD.

AB  - Drug-induced Mood- and Cognition-related adverse events (MCAEs) are often only 
      detected during the clinical trial phases of drug development, or even after 
      marketing, thus posing a major safety concern and a challenge for both 
      pharmaceutical companies and clinicians. To fill some gaps in the understanding 
      and elucidate potential biological mechanisms of action frequently associated 
      with MCAEs, we present a unique workflow linking observational population data 
      with the available knowledge at molecular, cellular, and psychopharmacology 
      levels. It is based on statistical analysis of pharmacovigilance reports and 
      subsequent signaling pathway analyses, followed by evidence-based expert manual 
      curation of the outcomes. Our analysis: (a) ranked pharmaceuticals with high 
      occurrence of such adverse events (AEs), based on disproportionality analysis of 
      the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, and (b) identified 120 
      associated genes and common pathway nodes possibly underlying MCAEs. Nearly 
      two-thirds of the identified genes were related to immune modulation, which 
      supports the critical involvement of immune cells and their responses in the 
      regulation of the central nervous system function. This finding also means that 
      pharmaceuticals with a negligible central nervous system exposure may induce 
      MCAEs through dysregulation of the peripheral immune system. Knowledge gained 
      through this workflow unravels putative hallmark biological targets and mediators 
      of drug-induced mood and cognitive disorders that need to be further assessed and 
      validated in experimental models. Thereafter, they can be used to substantially 
      improve in silico/in vitro/in vivo tools for predicting these adversities at a 
      preclinical stage.

AB  - In sexually reproducing species, increased homozygosity often causes a decline in 
      fitness, called inbreeding depression. Recently, researchers started describing 
      the functional genomic changes that occur during inbreeding, both in benign 
      conditions and under environmental stress. To further this aim, we have performed 
      a genome-wide gene expression study of inbreeding depression, manifesting as cold 
      sensitivity and conditional lethality. Our focus was to describe general patterns 
      of gene expression during inbreeding depression and to identify specific 
      processes affected in our line. There was a clear difference in gene expression 
      between the stressful restrictive environment and the benign permissive 
      environment in both the affected inbred line and the inbred control line. We 
      noted a strong inbreeding-by-environment interaction, whereby virtually all 
      transcriptional differences between lines were found in the restrictive 
      environment. Functional annotation showed enrichment of transcripts coding for 
      serine proteases and their inhibitors (serpins and BPTI/Kunitz family), which 
      indicates activation of the innate immune response. These genes have previously 
      been shown to respond transcriptionally to cold stress, suggesting the 
      conditional lethal effect is associated with an exaggerated cold stress response. 
      The set of differentially expressed genes significantly overlapped with those 
      found in three other studies of inbreeding depression, demonstrating that it is 
      possible to detect a common signature across different genetic backgrounds.

AB  - To deal with stress and exhaustion at work, personal resources need to be 
      replenished during breaks. The aim of this laboratory study (n = 122 students) 
      was to test the restorative potential of sensory-enriched break environments 
      (SEBEs) in between-subjects with repeated measures design, focusing on the type 
      of the environment (natural outdoor vs. built indoor environment) and sensory 
      input (no sensory input vs. audiovisual input vs. audiovisual and olfactory 
      input). Analyses showed that SEBEs simulating either a natural or a lounge 
      environment were perceived as more pleasant and restorative (fascination/being 
      away) than a standard break room, which in turn facilitated the recovery of 
      personal resources (mood, fatigue, arousal). Moreover, adding a congruent scent 
      to an audiovisual simulation indirectly facilitated the recovery of personal 
      resources via greater scent pleasantness and higher fascination and being away. 
      The current study shows the opportunities for sensory enrichment to foster 
      restoration in break environments.

TI  - An Integrative Pharmacology-Based Strategy to Uncover the Mechanism of 
      Xiong-Pi-Fang in Treating Coronary Heart Disease with Depression.
PG  - 590602
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.590602 [doi]
LID - 590602
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to explore the mechanism of Xiong-Pi-Fang (XPF) in 
      the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) with depression by an integrative 
      strategy combining serum pharmacochemistry, network pharmacology analysis, and 
      experimental validation. Methods: An ultrahigh performance liquid 
      chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) 
      method was constructed to identify compounds in rat serum after oral 
      administration of XPF, and a component-target network was established using 
      Cytoscape, between the targets of XPF ingredients and CHD with depression. 
      Furthermore, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway 
      enrichment analyses were performed to deduce the mechanism of XPF in treating CHD 
      with depression. Finally, in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-and 
      isoproterenol (ISO)-induced rat model, TUNEL was used to detect the apoptosis 
      index of the myocardium and hippocampus, ELISA and western blot were used to 
      detect the predicted hub targets, namely AngII, 5-HT, cAMP, PKA, CREB, BDNF, 
      Bcl-2, Bax, Cyt-c, and caspase-3. Results: We identified 51 compounds in rat 
      serum after oral administration of XPF, which mainly included phenolic acids, 
      saponins, and flavonoids. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that XPF may 
      regulate targets, such as ACE2, HTR1A, HTR2A, AKT1, PKIA, CREB1, BDNF, BCL2, BAX, 
      CASP3, cAMP signaling pathway, and cell apoptosis process in the treatment of CHD 
      with depression. ELISA analysis showed that XPF decreased Ang-II content in the 
      circulation and central nervous system, inhibited 5-HT levels in peripheral 
      circulation, and increased 5-HT content in the central nervous system and cAMP 
      content in the myocardia and hippocampus. Meanwhile, western blot analysis 
      indicated that XPF could upregulate the expression levels of PKA, CREB, and BDNF 
      both in the myocardia and hippocampus. TUNEL staining indicated that the 
      apoptosis index of myocardial and hippocampal cells increased in CUMS-and 
      ISO-induced CHD in rats under depression, and XPF could increase the expression 
      of Bcl-2, inhibit the expression of Bax, Cyt-c, and caspase-3, and rectify the 
      injury of the hippocampus and myocardium, which exerted antidepressant and 
      antimyocardial ischemia effects. Conclusion: Our study proposed an integrated 
      strategy, combining serum pharmacochemistry and network pharmacology to 
      investigate the mechanisms of XPF in treating CHD with depression. The mechanism 
      of XPF in treating CHD with depression may be related to the activation of the 
      cAMP signaling pathway and the inhibition of the apoptosis.

TI  - Perturbations in Gut Microbiota Composition in Psychiatric Disorders: A Review 
      and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1343-1354
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.2573 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Evidence of gut microbiota perturbations has accumulated for multiple 
      psychiatric disorders, with microbiota signatures proposed as potential 
      biomarkers. However, no attempts have been made to evaluate the specificity of 
      these across the range of psychiatric conditions. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an 
      umbrella and updated meta-analysis of gut microbiota alterations in general adult 
      psychiatric populations and perform a within- and between-diagnostic comparison. 
      DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched up to 
      February 2, 2021, for systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and original evidence. 
      STUDY SELECTION: A total of 59 case-control studies evaluating diversity or 
      abundance of gut microbes in adult populations with major depressive disorder, 
      bipolar disorder, psychosis and schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, 
      obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Between-group comparisons of relative abundance of gut microbes and 
      beta diversity indices were extracted and summarized qualitatively. 
      Random-effects meta-analyses on standardized mean difference (SMD) were performed 
      for alpha diversity indices. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alpha and beta diversity 
      and relative abundance of gut microbes. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies provided 
      data and were included in alpha diversity meta-analyses (n = 1519 patients, 
      n = 1429 control participants). Significant decrease in microbial richness in 
      patients compared with control participants were found (observed species 
      SMD = -0.26; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.06; Chao1 SMD = -0.5; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.21); 
      however, this was consistently decreased only in bipolar disorder when individual 
      diagnoses were examined. There was a small decrease in phylogenetic diversity 
      (SMD = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.001) and no significant differences in Shannon 
      and Simpson indices. Differences in beta diversity were consistently observed 
      only for major depressive disorder and psychosis and schizophrenia. Regarding 
      relative abundance, little evidence of disorder specificity was found. Instead, a 
      transdiagnostic pattern of microbiota signatures was found. Depleted levels of 
      Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus and enriched levels of Eggerthella were 
      consistently shared between major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, 
      psychosis and schizophrenia, and anxiety, suggesting these disorders are 
      characterized by a reduction of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria, 
      while pro-inflammatory genera are enriched. The confounding associations of 
      region and medication were also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This 
      systematic review and meta-analysis found that gut microbiota perturbations were 
      associated with a transdiagnostic pattern with a depletion of certain 
      anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria and an enrichment of 
      pro-inflammatory bacteria in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, 
      schizophrenia, and anxiety.

TI  - GAME (Goals - Activity - Motor Enrichment): protocol of a single blind randomised 
      controlled trial of motor training, parent education and environmental enrichment 
      for infants at high risk of cerebral palsy.
PG  - 203

LID - 203
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability of childhood 
      and early detection is possible using evidence based assessments. Systematic 
      reviews indicate early intervention trials rarely demonstrate efficacy for 
      improving motor outcomes but environmental enrichment interventions appear 
      promising. This study is built on a previous pilot study and has been designed to 
      assess the effectiveness of a goal - oriented motor training and enrichment 
      intervention programme, "GAME", on the motor outcomes of infants at very high 
      risk of cerebral palsy (CP) compared with standard community based care. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: A two group, single blind randomised controlled trial (n = 30) 
      will be conducted. Eligible infants are those diagnosed with CP or designated "at 
      high risk of CP" on the basis of the General Movements Assessment and/or abnormal 
      neuroimaging. A physiotherapist and occupational therapist will deliver 
      home-based GAME intervention at least fortnightly until the infant's first 
      birthday. The intervention aims to optimize motor function and engage parents in 
      developmental activities aimed at enriching the home learning environment. 
      Primary endpoint measures will be taken 16 weeks after intervention commences 
      with the secondary endpoint at 12 months and 24 months corrected age. The primary 
      outcome measure will be the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale second edition. 
      Secondary outcomes measures include the Gross Motor Function Measure, Bayley 
      Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Affordances in the Home Environment for 
      Motor Development - Infant Scale, and the Canadian Occupational Performance 
      Measure. Parent well-being will be monitored using the Depression Anxiety and 
      Stress Scale. DISCUSSION: This paper presents the background, design and 
      intervention protocol of a randomised trial of a goal driven, motor learning 
      approach with customised environmental interventions and parental education for 
      young infants at high risk of cerebral palsy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is 
      registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial register: 
      ACTRN12611000572965.

TI  - Exploring the mechanisms of action of Cordyceps sinensis for the treatment of 
      depression using network pharmacology and molecular docking.
PG  - 282
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-762 [doi]
LID - 282
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is the most common type of psychological disorder, with 
      continuous, prolonged, and persistent bad moods as the main clinical feature. 
      Cordyceps sinensis is a complex consisting of the ascospores and bodies of insect 
      larvae from the Hepialidae family that have been parasitized by Cordyceps 
      sinensis militaris. Previous studies have reported that this herb has 
      antidepressant activity. The present study used network pharmacology and 
      molecular docking techniques to investigate the potential antidepressant 
      mechanisms of Cordyceps sinensis. METHODS: The active ingredients of Cordyceps 
      sinensis were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems 
      Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and the potential targets 
      were predicted using the PharmMapper platform. The GeneCards database was then 
      used to obtain sub-targets for depression. Common targets were screened and 
      enrichment analyses were performed using the Metascape platform. Finally, the 
      relationship between the active ingredients and the core targets were verified by 
      molecular docking. RESULTS: Through network pharmacological analysis, 7 active 
      ingredients in Cordyceps sinensis and 41 common targets of drugs and diseases 
      were identified. The active ingredients of Cordyceps sinensis may exert 
      antidepressant effects by acting on important targets such as catalase (CAT), 
      CREB binding protein (CREBBP), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and E1A binding 
      protein P300 (EP300), and by modulating the signaling pathways in which these 
      targets are involved. Subsequently, the core targets were docked to the active 
      ingredients and good binding was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The active ingredients of 
      Cordyceps sinensis may exert antidepressant effects by regulating the CREB 
      binding protein and anti-oxidative stress effects. The foxo signaling pathway 
      (hsa04068), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway (hsa04066), and 
      Huntington's disease (hsa05016) may be involved in the underlying mechanisms of 
      Cordyceps sinensis. The joint application of network pharmacology and molecular 
      docking provides a new approach to study the mechanisms of action of traditional 
      Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis may play an important role in the future 
      treatment of patients with depression.

TI  - Early life factors of schizotypal personality disorder in adolescents: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 1092-1112
LID - 10.1111/jpm.12733 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: The complexity and high prevalence of schizotypal 
      personality disorders (SPD) pose serious challenges for mental health practice in 
      its management, and also bring severe consequences for the patients. The 
      identification of the specific early life factors (ELFs) that confer risk to SPD 
      has become a major focus of clinical research on schizophrenia-spectrum disorders 
      which aligns well with the mental health nursing's responsibility in health 
      promotion, prevention and treatment. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: 
      Adolescents may experience certain ELFs, which contribute to the occurrence of 
      SPD, but no systematic review has been conducted to identify ELF among them. And 
      nursing literature addressing modifiable ELF is very limited. Two clusters of ELF 
      and SPD in adolescents were identified: prenatal and early postnatal factors; 
      childhood trauma and parental factors. The findings also show that more research 
      is needed to determine the specificity and cumulative effects of ELF on the 
      development of SPD by using rigorous and comprehensive measurements and a 
      longitudinal design. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Mental health 
      nurses, especially nurses in the primary care, should be aware of potentially 
      modifiable ELFs and incorporate more comprehensive and valid instrument for 
      assessing cumulative ELF and SPD. These findings may serve to inform possible 
      future interventions for SPD, such as parent education and support to mitigate 
      these risk factors. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Schizotypal personality disorder 
      (SPD) affects 4% of the general population in the United States. The 
      identification of early life factors (ELFs) that confer risk to SPD in 
      adolescents (ages 10-24 years old) has become a major focus of clinical research 
      on schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. AIM: This systematic review aims to 
      determine what ELFs contribute to the onset of SPD in the adolescent population. 
      METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, Psychiatry online, Scopus, Web 
      of Science, EMBASE and CINAHL databases was conducted using relevant keywords. 
      Data were extracted using a standardized form following PRISMA guidelines. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met the criteria for inclusion. ELFs in the 
      development of SPD were grouped into two important clusters: (a) prenatal and 
      early postnatal factors; (b) childhood trauma and parental factors. CONCLUSION: 
      Mental health nurses, especially nurses in primary care, should be aware of 
      potentially modifiable ELF. Longitudinal research is needed to determine the 
      causative roles of these ELF play in the occurrence of SPD by using rigorous 
      measurements. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings call for awareness of the 
      modifiable ELF for SPD and also inform possible future interventions to reduce 
      these risks, such as parent-training or environmental enrichment programmes.

TI  - The meaning of the symbolic function in psychoanalytic psychotherapy: clinical 
      theory and psychotherapeutic applications.
PG  - 325-38
AB  - This study presents the clinical theory and psychotherapeutic applications of 
      symbolic function in psychoanalytic psychotherapy. The three modes of symbolic 
      function (indexical, iconic and conventional symbolic) form the representations 
      of the self and the object and further the unconscious fantasy, which includes 
      the affective bond between these representations. During his/her development the 
      child absorbs from the mother a new ego capacity (by means of identification), 
      which I call the reflective-integration capacity. Then, the ego of the child has 
      two crucial functions: the fantasy world adopted through the symbolic function 
      and the reflective-integrative capacity. In psychoanalytic psychotherapy our aim 
      is to study the fantasy world of the patient by means of the 
      reflective-integrative capacity, or if this capacity is missing or weak, to 
      promote its development. During psychoanalytic psychotherapy a shared area of 
      reflection-integration is formed, in which the healing changes occur. These 
      healing changes include mainly the formation, consolidation and enrichment of the 
      symbolic function of the patient. The consolidation of symbolic function and the 
      capacity to move within the different modes of symbolic function occur in the 
      area of psychology in which there are incapabilities and/or conflicts (e.g. 
      separation anxiety) in the patient. Clinical case material is presented to 
      illustrate these phenomena.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains 
      difficult, and one of the key challenges in diagnosing MDD is the lack of 
      reliable diagnostic biomarkers. The objective of this study was to explore gene 
      networks and identify potential biomarkers for MDD. METHODS: In the present 
      study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the mRNA expression profiles 
      using blood samples of four patients with MDD and four controls by RNA 
      sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened, and functional 
      and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, 
      Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. All DEGs were inputted to the STRING 
      database to build a PPI network, and the top 10 hub genes were screened using the 
      cytoHubba plugin of the Cytoscape software. The relative expression of 10 key 
      genes was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (qRT-PCR) of blood samples from 50 MDD patients and 50 controls. Plasma levels of 
      SQSTM1 and TNFα were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in blood 
      samples of 44 MDD patients and 44 controls. A sucrose preference test was used to 
      evaluate depression-like behavior in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) 
      model rats. Immunofluorescence assay and western blotting were performed to study 
      the expression of proteins in the brain samples of CUMS model rats. RESULTS: We 
      identified 247 DEGs that were closely associated with MDD. Gene ontology analyses 
      suggested that the DEGs were mainly enriched in negative regulation of 
      transcription by RNA polymerase II promoter, cytoplasm, and protein binding. 
      Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that 
      the DEGs were significantly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. Ten hub genes 
      were screened through the PPI network, and qRT-PCR assay revealed that one and 
      six genes were downregulated and upregulated, respectively; however, SMARCA2, 
      PPP3CB, and RAB5C were not detected. Pathway enrichment analysis for the 10 genes 
      showed that the mTOR signaling pathway was also enriched. A strong positive 
      correlation was observed between SQSTM1 and TNFα protein levels in patients with 
      MDD. LC3 II and SQSTM1 protein levels were increased in the CUMS rat model; 
      however, p-mTOR protein levels were decreased. The sucrose preference values 
      decreased in the CUMS rat model. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 247 DEGs and 
      constructed an MDD-specific network; thereafter, 10 hub genes were selected for 
      further analysis. Our results provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of 
      MDD. Moreover, SQSTM1, which is related to autophagy and inflammatory reactions, 
      may play a key role in MDD. SQSTM1 may be used as a promising therapeutic target 
      in MDD; additionally, more molecular mechanisms have been suggested that should 
      be focused on in future in vivo and in vitro studies.

AB  - Similar environmental risk factors have been implicated in different 
      neuropsychiatric disorders (including major psychiatric and neurodegenerative 
      diseases), indicating the existence of common epigenetic mechanisms underlying 
      the pathogenesis shared by different illnesses. To investigate such commonality, 
      we applied an unsupervised computational approach identifying several consensus 
      co-expression and co-methylation signatures from a data cohort of postmortem 
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples from individuals with six different 
      neuropsychiatric disorders-schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, 
      alcoholism, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's-as well as healthy controls. Among our 
      results, we identified a pair of strongly interrelated co-expression and 
      co-methylation (E-M) signatures showing consistent and significant disease 
      association in multiple types of disorders. This E-M signature was enriched for 
      interneuron markers, and we further demonstrated that it is unlikely for this 
      enrichment to be due to varying subpopulation abundance of normal interneurons 
      across samples. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis revealed 
      overrepresentation of stress-related biological processes in this E-M signature. 
      Our integrative analysis of expression and methylation profiles, therefore, 
      suggests a stress-related epigenetic mechanism in the brain, which could be 
      associated with the pathogenesis of multiple neuropsychiatric diseases.

TI  - Epigenetic regulation of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.
PG  - 122-34
LID - 10.1038/hdy.2010.27 [doi]
AB  - The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is an exception to a 
      'neurogenesis-unfriendly' environment of the adult brain. New functional neurons 
      generated in this region contribute to learning and mood regulation, and thus 
      represent a unique form of neural plasticity. The rate of hippocampal 
      neurogenesis significantly changes on physiological or pathological influences, 
      such as physical activity, environmental enrichment, stress, and aging. We 
      suggest that epigenetic mechanisms could be sensors of environmental changes and 
      fine modulators of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we examine the role of 
      DNA methylation and methylation of core histones mediated by the Polycomb and 
      Trithorax complexes in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. Given the recent 
      surprising discovery of dynamic and reversible DNA methylation in the 
      hippocampus, we speculate regarding its regulation and its role in adult 
      neurogenesis.

TI  - Integrated Network Pharmacology and GC-MS-Based Metabolomics to Investigate the 
      Effect of Xiang-Su Volatile Oil Against Menopausal Depression.

LID - 765638
AB  - Menopausal depression perplexes a great number of women in later life. 
      Xiangfu-Zisu (Xiang-Su), a traditional Chinese herbal pair composed of rhizomes 
      of Cyperus rotundus L. (Xiangfu) and leaves of Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt. 
      (Zisu), is frequently reported with antidepressant-like effects. The volatile oil 
      from Xiangfu and Zisu has shown good antidepressant action, but its mechanism is 
      still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacological mechanism of 
      Xiang-Su (XS) volatile oil against menopausal depression through gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based network pharmacology and 
      metabolomics. First, ADME screening was performed on actual detected components 
      of XS volatile oil to obtain active constituents, and then duplicates of active 
      constituent-related targets and menopausal depression-related targets were 
      collected. These duplicates were considered as targets for XS volatile oil 
      against menopausal depression, followed by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. It 
      showed that a total of 64 compounds were identified in XS volatile oil, and 38 
      active compounds were screened out. 42 overlapping genes between 144 
      compound-related genes and 780 menopausal depression-related genes were obtained. 
      Results showed that targets of SLC6A4 and SLC6A3, regulation of serotonergic and 
      dopaminergic synapses, were involved in the antidepressant mechanism of XS 
      volatile oil. Next, antidepressant-like effect of XS volatile oil was validated 
      in menopausal rats by ovariectomy (OVX) combined with chronic unpredictable mild 
      stress (CUMS). Behavioral tests, biochemical analysis, and GC-MS-based 
      non-targeted plasma metabolomics were employed to validate the antidepressant 
      effect of XS volatile oil. Experimental evidence demonstrated that XS volatile 
      oil reversed behavioral parameters in the sucrose preference test (SPT), 
      open-field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), and serum estradiol levels in OVX 
      rats. Furthermore, results of metabolomics indicated that XS volatile oil mainly 
      acts on regulating metabolic pathways of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan 
      biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism, which were 
      corresponding with the above-predicted results. These data suggest that network 
      pharmacology combined with metabolomics provides deep insight into the 
      antidepressant effect of XS volatile oil, which includes regulating key targets 
      like SLC6A4 and SLC6A3, and pathways of serotonergic and dopaminergic synapses.

TI  - Proteomics Study Reveals the Anti-Depressive Mechanisms and the Compatibility 
      Advantage of Chaihu-Shugan-San in a Rat Model of Chronic Unpredictable Mild 
      Stress.
PG  - 791097

LID - 791097
AB  - Background: Chaihu-Shugan-San is a classical prescription to treat depression. 
      According to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principle, the 2 decomposed 
      recipes in Chaihu-Shugan-San exert synergistic effects, including Shu Gan 
      (stagnated Gan-Qi dispersion) and Rou Gan (Gan nourishment to alleviate pain). 
      However, the specific mechanism of Chaihu-Shugan-San on depression and its 
      compatibility rule remain to be explored. Objective: We aimed to explore the 
      anti-depression mechanisms and analyze the advantage of TCM compatibility of 
      Chaihu-Shugan-San. Methods: The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat 
      model was established. Antidepressant effects were evaluated by sucrose 
      preference test (SPT), and forced swimming test (FST). Tandem Mass Tag 
      (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics of the hippocampus was used to obtain 
      differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Bioinformatics analysis including Gene 
      Ontology (GO), pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
      was utilized to study the DEPs connections. At last, the achieved key targets 
      were verified by western blotting. Results: Chaihu-Shugan-San increased weight 
      gain and food intake, as well as exhibited better therapeutic effects including 
      enhanced sucrose preference and extended immobility time when compared with its 
      decomposed recipes. Proteomics showed Chaihu-Shugan-San, Shu Gan, and Rou Gan 
      regulated 110, 12, and 407 DEPs, respectively. Compared with Shu Gan or Rou Gan 
      alone, the expression of 22 proteins was additionally changed by 
      Chaihu-Shugan-San treatment, whereas the expression of 323 proteins whose 
      expression was changed by Shu Gan or Rou Gan alone were not changed by 
      Chaihu-Shugan-San treatment. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that 
      Chaihu-Shugan-San affected neurotransmitter's release and transmission cycle 
      (e.g., γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine, 
      dopamine, and acetylcholine). GABA release pathway is also targeted by the 22 
      DEPs. Unexpectedly, only 2 pathways were enriched by the 323 DEPs: Metabolism and 
      Cellular responses to external stimuli. Lastly, the expression of Gad2, Vamp2, 
      and Pde2a was verified by western blotting. Conclusions: Chaihu-Shugan-San treats 
      depression via multiple targets and pathways, which may include regulations of 
      110 DEPs and some neurotransmitter's transmission cycle. Compared with Shu Gan 
      and Rou Gan, the 22 Chaihu-Shugan-San advanced proteins and the affected GABA 
      pathway may be the advantages of Chaihu-Shugan-San compatibility. This research 
      offers data and theory support for the clinical application of Chaihu-Shugan-San.

AB  - Aging is a natural process that is associated with cognitive decline as well as 
      functional and social impairments. One structure of particular interest when 
      considering aging and cognitive decline is the hippocampus, a brain region known 
      to play an important role in learning and memory consolidation as well as in 
      affective behaviours and mood regulation, and where both functional and 
      structural plasticity (e.g., neurogenesis) occur well into adulthood. 
      Neurobiological alterations seen in the aging hippocampus including increased 
      oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, altered intracellular signalling and gene 
      expression, as well as reduced neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, are thought 
      to be associated with age-related cognitive decline. Non-invasive strategies such 
      as caloric restriction, physical exercise, and environmental enrichment have been 
      shown to counteract many of the age-induced alterations in hippocampal 
      signalling, structure, and function. Thus, such approaches may have therapeutic 
      value in counteracting the deleterious effects of aging and protecting the brain 
      against age-associated neurodegenerative processes.

TI  - Waking the sleeping dragon: gene expression profiling reveals adaptive strategies 
      of the hibernating reptile Pogona vitticeps.
PG  - 460
LID - 10.1186/s12864-019-5750-x [doi]
LID - 460
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hibernation is a physiological state exploited by many animals 
      exposed to prolonged adverse environmental conditions associated with winter. 
      Large changes in metabolism and cellular function occur, with many stress 
      response pathways modulated to tolerate physiological challenges that might 
      otherwise be lethal. Many studies have sought to elucidate the molecular 
      mechanisms of mammalian hibernation, but detailed analyses are lacking in 
      reptiles. Here we examine gene expression in the Australian central bearded 
      dragon (Pogona vitticeps) using mRNA-seq and label-free quantitative mass 
      spectrometry in matched brain, heart and skeletal muscle samples from animals at 
      late hibernation, 2 days post-arousal and 2 months post-arousal. RESULTS: We 
      identified differentially expressed genes in all tissues between hibernation and 
      post-arousal time points; with 4264 differentially expressed genes in brain, 5340 
      differentially expressed genes in heart, and 5587 differentially expressed genes 
      in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we identified 2482 differentially expressed 
      genes across all tissues. Proteomic analysis identified 743 proteins (58 
      differentially expressed) in brain, 535 (57 differentially expressed) in heart, 
      and 337 (36 differentially expressed) in skeletal muscle. Tissue-specific 
      analyses revealed enrichment of protective mechanisms in all tissues, including 
      neuroprotective pathways in brain, cardiac hypertrophic processes in heart, and 
      atrophy protective pathways in skeletal muscle. In all tissues stress response 
      pathways were induced during hibernation, as well as evidence for gene expression 
      regulation at transcription, translation and post-translation. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results reveal critical stress response pathways and protective mechanisms that 
      allow for maintenance of both tissue-specific function, and survival during 
      hibernation in the central bearded dragon. Furthermore, we provide evidence for 
      multiple levels of gene expression regulation during hibernation, particularly 
      enrichment of miRNA-mediated translational repression machinery; a process that 
      would allow for rapid and energy efficient reactivation of translation from 
      mature mRNA molecules at arousal. This study is the first molecular investigation 
      of its kind in a hibernating reptile, and identifies strategies not yet observed 
      in other hibernators to cope stress associated with this remarkable state of 
      metabolic depression.

TI  - Identification of Novel, Replicable Genetic Risk Loci for Suicidal Thoughts and 
      Behaviors Among US Military Veterans.
PG  - 135-145
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.3896 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Suicide is a leading cause of death; however, the molecular genetic 
      basis of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (SITB) remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To 
      identify novel, replicable genomic risk loci for SITB. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This genome-wide association study included 633 778 US military 
      veterans with and without SITB, as identified through electronic health records. 
      GWAS was performed separately by ancestry, controlling for sex, age, and genetic 
      substructure. Cross-ancestry risk loci were identified through meta-analysis. 
      Study enrollment began in 2011 and is ongoing. Data were analyzed from November 
      2021 to August 2022. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: SITB. RESULTS: A total of 633 778 
      US military veterans were included in the analysis (57 152 [9%] female; 121 118 
      [19.1%] African ancestry, 8285 [1.3%] Asian ancestry, 452 767 [71.4%] European 
      ancestry, and 51 608 [8.1%] Hispanic ancestry), including 121 211 individuals 
      with SITB (19.1%). Meta-analysis identified more than 200 GWS (P < 5 × 10-8) 
      cross-ancestry risk single-nucleotide variants for SITB concentrated in 7 regions 
      on chromosomes 2, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18. Top single-nucleotide variants were 
      largely intronic in nature; 5 were independently replicated in ISGC, including 
      rs6557168 in ESR1, rs12808482 in DRD2, rs77641763 in EXD3, rs10671545 in DCC, and 
      rs36006172 in TRAF3. Associations for FBXL19 and AC018880.2 were not replicated. 
      Gene-based analyses implicated 24 additional GWS cross-ancestry risk genes, 
      including FURIN, TSNARE1, and the NCAM1-TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 gene cluster. 
      Cross-ancestry enrichment analyses revealed significant enrichment for expression 
      in brain and pituitary tissue, synapse and ubiquitination processes, amphetamine 
      addiction, parathyroid hormone synthesis, axon guidance, and dopaminergic 
      pathways. Seven other unique European ancestry-specific GWS loci were identified, 
      2 of which (POM121L2 and METTL15/LINC02758) were replicated. Two additional GWS 
      ancestry-specific loci were identified within the African ancestry (PET112/GATB) 
      and Hispanic ancestry (intergenic locus on chromosome 4) subsets, both of which 
      were replicated. No GWS loci were identified within the Asian ancestry subset; 
      however, significant enrichment was observed for axon guidance, cyclic adenosine 
      monophosphate signaling, focal adhesion, glutamatergic synapse, and oxytocin 
      signaling pathways across all ancestries. Within the European ancestry subset, 
      genetic correlations (r > 0.75) were observed between the SITB phenotype and a 
      suicide attempt-only phenotype, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. 
      Additionally, polygenic risk score analyses revealed that the Million Veteran 
      Program polygenic risk score had nominally significant main effects in 2 
      independent samples of veterans of European and African ancestry. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: The findings of this analysis may advance understanding of the 
      molecular genetic basis of SITB and provide evidence for ESR1, DRD2, TRAF3, and 
      DCC as cross-ancestry candidate risk genes. More work is needed to replicate 
      these findings and to determine if and how these genes might impact clinical 
      care.

AB  - Psychoactive drugs that increase alertness, attention and concentration and 
      energy, while also elevating mood, heart rate and blood pressure are referred to 
      as stimulants. Despite some overlapping similarities, stimulants cannot be easily 
      categorized by their chemical structure, mechanism of action, receptor binding 
      profile, effects on monoamine uptake, behavioral pharmacology (e.g., effects on 
      locomotion, temperature, and blood pressure), therapeutic indication or efficacy. 
      Because of their abuse liability, a pre-market assessment of abuse potential is 
      required for drugs that show stimulant properties; this review article focuses on 
      the clinical aspects of this evaluation. This includes clinical trial adverse 
      events, evidence of diversion or tampering, overdoses and the results of a human 
      abuse potential study. While there are different types of human experimental 
      studies that can be employed to evaluate stimulant abuse potential (e.g., drug 
      discrimination, self-administration), only the human abuse potential study and 
      clinical trial adverse event data are required for drug approval. The principal 
      advances that have improved human abuse potential studies include using study 
      enrichment strategies (pharmacologic qualification), larger sample sizes, better 
      selection of endpoints and measurement strategies and more carefully considered 
      interpretation of data. Because of the methodological advances, comparisons of 
      newer studies with historical data is problematic and may contribute to a biased 
      regulatory framework for the evaluation of newer stimulant-like drugs, such as A2 
      antagonists. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'CNS Stimulants'.

TI  - Genome-wide methylation study on depression: differential methylation and 
      variable methylation in monozygotic twins.
PG  - e557
LID - 10.1038/tp.2015.49 [doi]
AB  - Depressive disorders have been shown to be highly influenced by environmental 
      pathogenic factors, some of which are believed to exert stress on human brain 
      functioning via epigenetic modifications. Previous genome-wide methylomic studies 
      on depression have suggested that, along with differential DNA methylation, 
      affected co-twins of monozygotic (MZ) pairs have increased DNA methylation 
      variability, probably in line with theories of epigenetic stochasticity. 
      Nevertheless, the potential biological roots of this variability remain largely 
      unexplored. The current study aimed to evaluate whether DNA methylation 
      differences within MZ twin pairs were related to differences in their 
      psychopathological status. Data from the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 
      Beadchip was used to evaluate peripheral blood DNA methylation of 34 twins (17 MZ 
      pairs). Two analytical strategies were used to identify (a) differentially 
      methylated probes (DMPs) and (b) variably methylated probes (VMPs). Most DMPs 
      were located in genes previously related to neuropsychiatric phenotypes. 
      Remarkably, one of these DMPs (cg01122889) was located in the WDR26 gene, the DNA 
      sequence of which has been implicated in major depressive disorder from 
      genome-wide association studies. Expression of WDR26 has also been proposed as a 
      biomarker of depression in human blood. Complementarily, VMPs were located in 
      genes such as CACNA1C, IGF2 and the p38 MAP kinase MAPK11, showing enrichment for 
      biological processes such as glucocorticoid signaling. These results expand on 
      previous research to indicate that both differential methylation and differential 
      variability have a role in the etiology and clinical manifestation of depression, 
      and provide clues on specific genomic loci of potential interest in the 
      epigenetics of depression.

TI  - Relationship between Urinary Metabolomic Profiles and Depressive Episode in 
      Antarctica.

AB  - Antarctic expeditions have a high risk of participant depression owing to long 
      stays and isolated environments. By quantifying the stress state and changes in 
      biomolecules over time before the onset of depressive symptoms, predictive 
      markers of depression can be explored. Here, we evaluated the psychological 
      changes in 30 participants in the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition using 
      the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Urinary samples were collected every 
      three months for a year, and comprehensive urinary metabolomic profiles were 
      quantified using liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Five 
      participants showed major depressive episodes (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) at 12 months. The 
      urinary metabolites between these participants and the 25 unaffected participants 
      were compared at individual metabolite and pathway levels. The individual 
      comparisons showed the most significant differences at 12 months in 14 
      metabolites, including ornithine and beta-alanine. Data from shorter stays showed 
      less significant differences. In contrast, pathway and enrichment analyses showed 
      the most significant difference at three months and a less significant difference 
      at longer stays. These time transitions of urinary metabolites could help in the 
      development of urinary biomarkers to detect subjects with depressive episodes at 
      an early stage.

AB  - To evaluate changes in DNA methylation profiles in patients with fibromyalgia 
      (FM) compared to matched healthy controls (HCs). All individuals underwent full 
      clinical and neurophysiological assessment by cortical excitability (CE) 
      parameters measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation. DNA from the peripheral 
      blood of patients with FM (n = 24) and HC (n = 24) were assessed using the 
      Illumina-HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. We identified 1610 differentially 
      methylated positions (DMPs) in patients with FM displaying a nonrandom 
      distribution in regions of the genome. Sixty-nine percent of DMP in FM were 
      hypomethylated compared to HC. Differentially methylated positions were enriched 
      in 5 genomic regions (1p34; 6p21; 10q26; 17q25; 19q13). The functional 
      characterization of 960 genes related to DMPs revealed an enrichment for MAPK 
      signaling pathway (n = 18 genes), regulation of actin cytoskeleton (n = 15 
      genes), and focal adhesion (n = 13 genes). A gene-gene interaction network 
      enrichment analysis revealed the participation of DNA repair pathways, 
      mitochondria-related processes, and synaptic signaling. Even though DNA was 
      extracted from peripheral blood, this set of genes was enriched for disorders 
      such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, bulimia, hyperphagia, and obesity. 
      Remarkably, the hierarchical clusterization based on the methylation levels of 
      the 1610 DMPs showed an association with neurophysiological measurements of CE in 
      FM and HC. Fibromyalgia has a hypomethylation DNA pattern, which is enriched in 
      genes implicated in stress response and DNA repair/free radical clearance. These 
      changes occurred parallel to changes in CE parameters. New epigenetic insights 
      into the pathophysiology of FM may provide the basis for the development of 
      biomarkers of this disorder.

TI  - Identification of Key Modules and Genes Associated with Major Depressive Disorder 
      in Adolescents.
LID - 10.3390/genes13030464 [doi]
LID - 464
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. 
      Adolescence is a crucial period for the occurrence and development of depression. 
      There are essential distinctions between adolescent and adult depression 
      patients, and the etiology of depressive disorder is unclear. The interactions of 
      multiple genes in a co-expression network are likely to be involved in the 
      physiopathology of MDD. In the present study, RNA-Seq data of mRNA were acquired 
      from the peripheral blood of MDD in adolescents and healthy control (HC) 
      subjects. Co-expression modules were constructed via weighted gene co-expression 
      network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate the relationships between the underlying 
      modules and MDD in adolescents. In the combined MDD and HC groups, the dynamic 
      tree cutting method was utilized to assign genes to modules through hierarchical 
      clustering. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis was conducted on those 
      co-expression genes from interested modules. The results showed that eight 
      modules were constructed by WGCNA. The blue module was significantly associated 
      with MDD after multiple comparison adjustment. Several Gene Ontology (GO) terms 
      and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways associated with 
      stress and inflammation were identified in this module, including histone 
      methylation, apoptosis, NF-kappa β signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. 
      Five genes related to inflammation, immunity, and the nervous system were 
      identified as hub genes: CNTNAP3, IL1RAP, MEGF9, UBE2W, and UBE2D1. All of these 
      findings supported that MDD was associated with stress, inflammation, and immune 
      responses, helping us to obtain a better understanding of the internal molecular 
      mechanism and to explore biomarkers for the diagnosis or treatment of depression 
      in adolescents.

AB  - Earthworms have a central role in ministering the terrestrial ecosystems and are 
      proving to have an important role in modulating the effects climate change has on 
      soil. Aestivation is a form of dormancy employed by the organisms living in 
      deserts and arid environments, when confronted with prolonged periods of drought. 
      Understanding global metabolic adjustments required for withstanding the harsh 
      conditions of the ever more severe Iberian drought, we performed a global 
      transcriptomic exploration of the endogeic earthworm Carpetania matritensis 
      during aestivation. There were a total of 6352 differentially expressed 
      transcripts in the aestivating group, with 65% being downregulated. Based on GO 
      and KEGG enrichment analyses, downregulated genes seem to be indicative of an 
      overall metabolic depression during aestivation. Indeed we noted a reduction of 
      protein turnover and macromolecule metabolism coupled with suppression of genes 
      involved in digestion. Upregulated genes, namely antioxidant genes and DNA repair 
      genes showed clear signs of abiotic stress caused by ROS generation. Abiotic 
      stress led to transcriptomic changes of genes involved in immune response, mostly 
      affecting the NF-kb signaling pathway as well as changes in apoptotic genes 
      indicating the necessity of investigating these processes in a tissue specific 
      manner. Lastly we uncovered a possible mechanism for water retention by 
      nitrogenous waste accumulation. This study provides the first ever transcriptomic 
      investigation done on aestivating earthworms and as such serves as a general 
      framework for investigation on other earthworm species and other soil 
      invertebrates, which is becoming increasingly important with the current scenario 
      of climate change.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs, i.e., abuse, neglect, household dysfunction) 
      represent a potential risk factor for a wide range of long-lasting diseases and 
      shorter life expectancy. We recently described a 1-week residential group 
      program, based on mindfulness training, artistic expression and EMDR group 
      therapy, that significantly reduced PTSD-related symptoms and increased 
      attention/awareness-related outcomes in adolescent girls with multiple ACEs in a 
      randomized controlled study. Since epigenetic mechanisms (i.e., DNA methylation) 
      have been associated with the long-lasting effects of ACEs, the present report 
      extends these prior findings by exploring genome-wide DNA methylation changes 
      following the program. Saliva samples from all participants (n = 44) were 
      collected and genomic DNA was extracted prior (T1) and following (T2) the 
      intervention. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the MethylationEPIC 
      beadchip array (Illumina) revealed 49 differentially methylated loci (DML; p 
      value < 0.001; methylation change > 10%) that were annotated to genes with roles 
      in biological processes linked to early childhood adversity (i.e., neural, 
      immune, and endocrine pathways, cancer and cardiovascular disease). DNA sequences 
      flanking these DML showed significant enrichment of transcription factor binding 
      sites involved in inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and brain 
      development. Methylation changes in SIRT5 and TRAPPC2L genes showed associations 
      with changes in trauma-related psychological measures. Results presented here 
      suggest that this multimodal group program for adolescents with multiple

AB  - As a model for vertebrate long-term survival in oxygen-restricted environments, 
      the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) can adapt at the 
      biochemical level to survive in oxygen-free (anoxic) cold water (<10°C). This 
      impressive ability is enabled through a coordinated suppression of 
      energy-expensive, non-essential, cell processes. This study explored the 
      anoxia-responsive expression of several microRNA species (miR-1a, -133, -17, 
      -107, -148a, -21, -103, -210, -20a, -365 and -29b) in adult turtles exposed to 5h 
      and 20h anoxia (at 5±1°C). Furthermore, since microRNA target binding is 
      regularly defined only by microRNA-mRNA interactions at 37°C, the possibility of 
      unique low temperature-selective microRNA targeting interactions with mRNA was 
      explored in this ectotherm. Approximately twice as many microRNA-mRNA 
      interactions were predicted at 5°C versus 37°C with particular enrichment of mRNA 
      targets involved in biological processes known to be part of the stress response. 
      Hence, the results suggest that the influence of temperature should be considered 
      for the prediction of microRNA targets (and their follow-up) in poikilothermic 
      animals and that interacting effects of low body temperature and anoxia on 
      microRNA expression could potentially be important to achieve the profound 
      metabolic rate depression that characterizes turtle hibernation underwater during 
      the winter.

AB  - Tinnitus, a phantom perception of sound in the absence of any external sound 
      source, is a prevalent health condition often accompanied by psychiatric 
      comorbidities. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) highlighted a 
      polygenic nature of tinnitus susceptibility. A shared genetic component between 
      tinnitus and psychiatric conditions remains elusive. Here we present a GWAS using 
      the UK Biobank to investigate the genetic processes linked to tinnitus and 
      tinnitus-related distress, followed by gene-set enrichment analyses. The UK 
      Biobank sample comprised 132,438 individuals with tinnitus and genotype data. 
      Among the study sample, 38,525 individuals reported tinnitus, and 26,889 
      participants mentioned they experienced tinnitus-related distress in daily 
      living. The genome-wide association analyses were conducted on tinnitus and 
      tinnitus-related distress. We conducted enrichment analyses using FUMA to further 
      understand the genetic processes linked to tinnitus and tinnitus-related 
      distress. A genome-wide significant locus (lead SNP: rs71595470) for tinnitus was 
      obtained in the vicinity of GPM6A. Nineteen independent loci reached suggestive 
      association with tinnitus. Fifteen independent loci reached suggestive 
      association with tinnitus-related distress. The enrichment analysis revealed a 
      shared genetic component between tinnitus and psychiatric traits, such as bipolar 
      disorder, feeling worried, cognitive ability, fast beta electroencephalogram, and 
      sensation seeking. Metabolic, cardiovascular, hematological, and pharmacological 
      gene sets revealed a significant association with tinnitus. Anxiety and 
      stress-related gene sets revealed a significant association with tinnitus-related 
      distress. The GWAS signals for tinnitus were enriched in the hippocampus and 
      cortex, and for tinnitus-related distress were enriched in the brain and spinal 
      cord. This study provides novel insights into genetic processes associated with 
      tinnitus and tinnitus-related distress and demonstrates a shared genetic 
      component underlying tinnitus and psychiatric conditions. Further collaborative 
      attempts are necessary to identify genetic components underlying the phenotypic 
      heterogeneity in tinnitus and provide biological insight into the etiology.

TI  - [Mother-child treatments within the scope of public community psychiatric care. 
      Clinical treatment concept and experiences over 5 years].
PG  - 123-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Described are mother-child treatments performed within the framework 
      of regional maximum care at general psychiatric units not having such a 
      treatments focus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The new clinical concept with its social 
      and psychodynamic aspects is described. It provides realistic perspectives for 
      all involved. Last but not least it puts the child in a position as a helpful 
      companion for the mother. Over a space of 5 years, 20 mother-child treatments 
      were performed at four different wards. 12 mothers suffered from schizophrenia 
      (F20), 7 had depressive complaints (F32, F43), and one patient had a borderline 
      personality disorder (F60). Treatments lasted an average of 10 weeks, all mothers 
      retained their children. 16 patients were sent home; 2 were referred to a 
      mother-child facility; 1 patient was placed in a half-way home and another in a 
      house for women, in both cases with offspring. CONCLUSION: Mother-child treatment 
      under specific spatial conditions is not only possible, but is an enrichment for 
      all at general psychiatric units attending heterogeneous patients. The main 
      requirement is a certain level of treatment care, such as an established primary 
      care track, a clinic team that is flexible and open to novel approaches and, as a 
      result, willing to accept a certain level of stress as normal.

TI  - Integration of Non-Targeted Metabolomics and Targeted Quantitative Analysis to 
      Elucidate the Synergistic Antidepressant Effect of Bupleurum Chinense DC-Paeonia 
      Lactiflora Pall Herb Pair by Regulating Purine Metabolism.
PG  - 900459

LID - 900459
AB  - Bupleurum chinense DC (Chaihu)-Paeonia lactiflora Pall (Baishao) is among the 
      most accepted herb pairs in many classic antidepressant prescriptions. Our 
      previous study has shown that the Chaihu-Baishao herb pair (CBHP) had a better 
      antidepressant effect than Chaihu or Baishao. Nevertheless, the synergistic 
      antidepressant mechanism of this herb pair was not clearly understood. This study 
      aimed to investigate the compatibility mechanism of Chaihu and Baishao for 
      treating depression through a strategy of non-targeted metabolomics combined with 
      targeted quantitative analysis and molecular biology techniques. First, the 
      compatibility effects of CBHP were assessed by the chronic unpredictable mild 
      stress (CUMS) rat model. Next, cortex metabolomics based on 
      ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole orbitrap 
      mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap/MS) was used to discover the metabolic pathway 
      that was synergistically regulated by CBHP. Based on the results of metabolomics 
      analysis, metabolites were quantitatively validated by UPLC-MS/MS combined with 
      the MRM mode in the crucial metabolic pathway. In addition, the signaling pathway 
      associated with this metabolic pathway was detected by molecular biology 
      techniques to further identify the biological meaning of the crucial metabolite 
      on the synergistic antidepressant effect of CBHP. The antidepressant effect of 
      CBHP was significantly better than that of Chaihu or Baishao single administrated 
      in the behavioral test. According to cortex metabolomics, a total of 21 
      differential metabolites were screened out, and purine metabolism was selected as 
      the crucial metabolic pathway by the enrichment analysis of differential 
      metabolites. Subsequently, purine metabolism was confirmed as disorder in the 
      CUMS group by targeted quantitative analysis, CBHP regulated more purine 
      metabolites (six) than individual administration (two and two). The results 
      showed that purine metabolism was modulated by CBHP through synergistically 
      decreasing xanthine levels and inhibiting the conversion of xanthine 
      dehydrogenase (XDH) to xanthine oxidase (XOD). Finally, the synergistic 
      regulation effect of CBHP on xanthine synthesis was found to be related to 
      inhibition of malondialdehyde (MDA) production, Nod-like receptor protein 3 
      (NLRP3) inflammasome expression, and interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF)-α secretion. The present study demonstrated that the 
      regulation of purine metabolism, the suppression of oxidative stress, and 
      inflammatory responses in the cortex were involved in the synergistic 
      antidepressant effect of CBHP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: (203)Pb (t(1/2) = 51.9 h, 279 keV (81 %)) is a diagnostic SPECT 
      imaging radionuclide ideally suited for theranostic applications in combination 
      with (212)Pb for targeted alpha particle therapy. Our objectives were to develop 
      a high-yield solid target (203)Pb cyclotron production route using isotopically 
      enriched (205)Tl target material and the (205)Tl(p,3n)(203)Pb reaction as an 
      alternative to lower energy production via the (203)Tl(p,n)(203)Pb reaction. 
      METHODS: 250 mg (205)Tl metal (99.9 % isotopic enrichment) was pressed using a 
      hardened stainless steel die. Aluminum target discs were machined with a central 
      depression and annulus groove. The flattened (205)Tl pellet was placed into the 
      central depression of the Al disc and a circle of indium wire was laid in the 
      machined annulus surrounding the pellet. An aluminum foil cover was then pressed 
      onto the target disc to create an airtight bond. Targets were irradiated at 
      23.3 MeV for up to 516 min on a TR-24 cyclotron at currents up to 60 μA to 
      produce (203)Pb via the (205)Tl(p,3n)(203)Pb nuclear reaction. Following a 
      cool-down period of >12 h, the target was removed and (205)Tl dissolved in 4 M 
      HNO(3). A NEPTIS Mosaic-LC synthesis unit performed automated separation using 
      Eichrom Pb resin, and (203)Pb was eluted using 8 M HCl or 1 M NH(4)OAc. (205)Tl 
      was diverted to a vial for recovery in an electrolytic cell. (203)Pb product 
      radionuclidic purity was assessed by HPGe gamma spectroscopy, while elemental 
      purity was assessed by ICP-OES. Radiolabeling and stability studies were 
      performed with PSC, TCMC, and DOTA chelators, and (203)Pb incorporation was 
      verified by radio-TLC analysis. RESULTS: Cyclotron irradiations performed at 
      60 μA proton beam current and 23.3 MeV ((205)Tl incident energy) had a (203)Pb 
      saturated yield of 4658 ± 62 MBq/μA (n = 3). Automated NEPTIS separation took 
      <4 h from the start of target dissolution to product elution, yielding >85 % 
      decay-corrected [(203)Pb]PbCl(2) with a radionuclidic purity of >99.9 %. Purified 
      [(203)Pb]PbCl(2) yields of up to 12 GBq (203)Pb were attained (15.8 GBq at EOB). 
      The [(203)Pb]PbCl(2) and [(203)Pb]Pb(OAc)(2) products contained no detectable 
      radionuclidic impurities besides (201)Pb (<0.1 %), and <0.4 ppm stable Pb. 
      (205)Tl metal was recovered with a 92 % batch yield. Aliquots of 100 μL 
      [(203)Pb]Pb(OAc)(2) were used for radiolabeling PSC-Bn-NCS, TCMC-NCS, and 
      DOTA-NCS chelators at pH 4.5 and 22 °C for 30 min, with maximum respective molar 
      activities of 461 ± 30 GBq/μmol, 195 ± 37 GBq/μmol, and 83 ± 12 GBq/μmol. PSC, 
      TCMC, and DOTA chelators exhibited >99.9 % incorporation after a 120-hour 
      incubation in human serum at 37 °C. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear medicine centers with 
      access to higher energy cyclotrons can produce large (203)Pb activities 
      sufficient for clinical applications, with a convenient separation technique 
      producing highly pure [(203)Pb]PbCl(2) or [(203)Pb]Pb(OAc)(2) for direct 
      radiolabeling. This represents an attractive route to produce (203)Pb for 
      diagnostic SPECT imaging alongside (212)Pb targeted alpha particle therapy. 
      ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: Our high-yield (203)Pb 
      production technique significantly enhances (203)Pb production capabilities to 
      meet the growing preclinical and clinical demand for (203)Pb radiopharmaceuticals 
      alongside (212)Pb target alpha particle therapy.

AB  - The etiology of major depression (MDD), a common and complex disorder, remains 
      obscure. Gene expression profiling was conducted on post-mortem brain tissue 
      samples from Brodmann Area 10 (BA10) in the prefrontal cortex from psychotropic 
      drug-free persons with a history of MDD and age, gender, and post-mortem 
      interval-matched normal controls (n=14 pairs of subjects). Microarray analysis 
      was conducted using the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST arrays. A set of differential 
      expression changes was determined by dual-fold change-probability criteria 
      (∣average log ratios∣>0.585 [equivalent to a 1.5-fold difference in either 
      direction], P<0.01), whereas molecular pathways of interest were evaluated using 
      Gene Set Enrichment Analysis software. The results strongly implicate increased 
      apoptotic stress in the samples from the MDD group. Three anti-apoptotic factors, 
      Y-box-binding protein 1, caspase-1 dominant-negative inhibitor pseudo-ICE, and 
      the putative apoptosis inhibitor FKGS2, were over-expressed. Gene set analysis 
      suggested up-regulation of a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, 
      including interleukin 1α (IL-1α), IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12A, 
      IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, interferon gamma (IFNγ), and lymphotoxin α (TNF superfamily 
      member 1). The genes showing reduced expression included metallothionein 1M 
      (MT1M), a zinc-binding protein with a significant function in the modulation of 
      oxidative stress. The results of this study indicate that post-mortem brain 
      tissue samples from BA10, a region that is involved in reward-related behavior, 
      show evidence of local inflammatory, apoptotic, and oxidative stress in MDD.

AB  - Stress-induced disturbances of brain homeostasis and neuroinflammation have been 
      implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. In major depressive disorder 
      (MDD), elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines can be found 
      in peripheral blood, but very little is known about the changes that occur 
      directly in the brain. Microglia are the primary immune effector cells of the 
      central nervous system and exquisitely sensitive to changes in the brain 
      microenvironment. Here, we performed the first single-cell analysis of microglia 
      from four different post-mortem brain regions (frontal lobe, temporal lobe, 
      thalamus, and subventricular zone) of medicated individuals with MDD compared to 
      controls. We found no evidence for the induction of inflammation-associated 
      molecules, such as CD11b, CD45, CCL2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, MIP-1β (CCL4), IL-10, and 
      even decreased expression of HLA-DR and CD68 in microglia from MDD cases. In 
      contrast, we detected increased levels of the homeostatic proteins P2Y(12) 
      receptor, TMEM119 and CCR5 (CD195) in microglia from all brain regions of 
      individuals with MDD. We also identified enrichment of non-inflammatory CD206(hi) 
      macrophages in the brains of MDD cases. In sum, our results suggest enhanced 
      homeostatic functions of microglia in MDD.

PG  - 1093-118
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2014.928693 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The genetic background of antidepressant response represents a 
      unique opportunity to identify biological markers of treatment outcome. 
      Encouraging results alternating with inconsistent findings made antidepressant 
      pharmacogenetics a stimulating but often discouraging field that requires careful 
      discussion about cumulative evidence and methodological issues. AREAS COVERED: 
      The present review discusses both known and less replicated genes that have been 
      implicated in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) efficacy and side 
      effects. Candidate genes studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were 
      collected through MEDLINE database search (articles published till January 2014). 
      Further, GWAS signals localized in promising genetic regions according to 
      candidate gene studies are reported in order to assess the general comparability 
      of results obtained through these two types of pharmacogenetic studies. Finally, 
      a pathway enrichment approach is applied to the top genes (those harboring SNPs 
      with p < 0.0001) outlined by previous GWAS in order to identify possible 
      molecular mechanisms involved in SSRI effect. EXPERT OPINION: In order to improve 
      the understanding of SSRI pharmacogenetics, the present review discusses the 
      proposal of moving from the analysis of individual polymorphisms to genes and 
      molecular pathways, and from the separation across different methodological 
      approaches to their combination. Efforts in this direction are justified by the 
      recent evidence of a favorable cost-utility of gene-guided antidepressant 
      treatment.

LID - 10.1021/acs.est.5b05107 [doi]
AB  - Interactive effects of ocean acidification and ocean warming on marine calcifiers 
      vary among species, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. The 
      present study investigated the combined effects of seawater acidification and 
      elevated temperature (ambient condition: pH 8.1 × 23 °C, stress conditions: pH 
      7.8 × 23 °C, pH 8.1 × 28 °C, and pH 7.8 × 28 °C, exposure time: two months) on 
      the transcriptome and biomineralization of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, 
      which is an important marine calcifier. Transcriptome analyses indicated that P. 
      fucata implemented a compensatory acid-base mechanism, metabolic depression and 
      positive physiological responses to mitigate the effects of seawater 
      acidification alone. These responses were energy-expensive processes, leading to 
      decreases in the net calcification rate, shell surface calcium and carbon 
      content, and changes in the shell ultrastructure. Elevated temperature (28 °C) 
      within the thermal window of P. fucata did not induce significant enrichment of 
      the sequenced genes and conversely facilitated calcification, which was detected 
      to alleviate the negative effects of seawater acidification on biomineralization 
      and the shell ultrastructure. Overall, this study will help elucidate the 
      mechanisms by which pearl oysters respond to changing seawater conditions and 
      predict the effects of global climate change on pearl aquaculture.

AB  - Suicide is one of the leading causes of death globally for all ages, and as such 
      presents a very serious problem for clinicians worldwide. However, the underlying 
      neurobiological pathology remains to a large extent unknown. In order to address 
      this gap, we have carried out a genome-wide investigation of the gene expression 
      in the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and thalamus in post-mortem brain 
      samples obtained from 20 suicide completers and 7 control subjects. By 
      KEGG enrichment analysis indicated we identified novel clusters of downregulated 
      pathways involved in antigen neutralization and autoimmune thyroid disease 
      (amygdala, thalamus), decreased axonal plasticity in the hippocampus. Two 
      upregulated pathways were involved in neuronal death in the hippocampus and 
      olfactory transduction in the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex. Autoimmune 
      thyroid disease pathway was downregulated only in females. Metabolic pathways 
      involved in Notch signaling amino acid metabolism and unsaturated lipid synthesis 
      were thalamus-specific. Suicide-associated changes in the expression of several 
      genes and pseudogenes that point to various functional mechanisms possibly 
      implicated in the pathology of suicide. Two genes (SNORA13 and RNU4-2) involved 
      in RNA processing were common to all brain regions analyzed. Most of the 
      identified gene expression changes were related to region-specific dysregulated 
      manifestation of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental 
      disorders (SNORD114-10, SUSd1), motivation, addiction and motor disorders 
      (CHRNA6), long-term depression (RAB3B), stress response, major depression and 
      schizophrenia (GFAP), signal transduction at the neurovascular unit (NEXN) and 
      inhibitory neurotransmission in spatial learning, neural plasticity (CALB2; 
      CLIC6, ENPP1). Some of the differentially expressed genes were brain specific 
      non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of translation (SNORA13). One, (PARM1) 
      is a potential oncogene and prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer with no 
      known function in the brain. Disturbed gene expression involved in antigen 
      neutralization, autoimmunity, neural plasticity, stress response, signal 
      transduction at the neurovascular unit, dysregulated nuclear RNA processing and 
      translation and epigenetic imprinting signatures is associated with suicide and 
      point to regulatory non-coding RNAs as potential targets of new drugs 
      development.

AB  - Older adults living in the community or long-term residence such as a nursing 
      home are at increased risk for malnutrition due to factors such as depression and 
      isolation. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify the best available 
      research that evaluates the validity and reliability of nutrition assessment 
      tools, and the effectiveness of nutrition interventions to prevent or treat 
      malnutrition among older adults. A literature search was conducted in Medline, 
      Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central databases to identify clinical trials, 
      published in the English language, evaluating assessment and intervention methods 
      aimed to treat or prevent malnutrition among older adults living in the community 
      or their long-term residence such as nursing homes. Articles were screened by 2 
      reviewers, then data were extracted and narratively synthesized. The literature 
      search retrieved 20,937 articles and 197 articles were included in narrative 
      synthesis. A total of 73 assessment articles were identified, 36 of which were 
      validity and reliability trials. A total of 122 intervention articles were 
      identified, the majority of which were randomized controlled trials. A few of the 
      most commonly evaluated interventions were oral nutrition supplements, medical 
      nutrition therapy, fortification and enrichment, and nutrition education. Several 
      systematic reviews were identified, however, that did not meet the criteria of 
      this review. There is a need to conduct systematic reviews for nutrition 
      assessment and intervention trials to guide development of evidence-based 
      nutrition practice recommendations for older adults living in the community or 
      their long-term residence.

TI  - Comparative iTRAQ-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Pelteobagrus vachelli 
      Liver under Acute Hypoxia: Implications in Metabolic Responses.
LID - 10.1002/pmic.201700140 [doi]
AB  - More and more frequently these days, aquatic ecosystems are being stressed by 
      nutrient enrichment, pollutants, and global warming, leading to a serious 
      depletion in oxygen concentrations. Although a sudden, significant lack of oxygen 
      will result in mortality, fishes can have an acute behavior (e.g., an increase in 
      breathing rate, reduction in swimming frequency) and physiology responses (e.g., 
      increase in oxygen delivery, and reduction in oxygen consumption) to hypoxia, 
      which allows them to maintain normal physical activity. Therefore, in order to 
      shed further light on the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation in fishes, 
      the authors conduct comparative quantitative proteomics on Pelteobagrus vachelli 
      livers using iTRAQ. The research identifies 511 acute hypoxia-responsive proteins 
      in P. vachelli. Furthermore, comparison of several of the diverse key pathways 
      studied (e.g., peroxisome pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, lipid metabolism, 
      glycolysis/gluco-neogenesis, and amino acid metabolism) help to articulate the 
      different mechanisms involved in the hypoxia response of P. vachelli. Data from 
      proteome analysis shows that P. vachelli can have an acute reaction to hypoxia, 
      including detoxification of metabolic by-products and oxidative stress in light 
      of continued metabolic activity (e.g., peroxisomes), an activation in the 
      capacity of catabolism to get more energy (e.g., lipolysis and amino acid 
      catabolism), a depression in the capacity of biosynthesis to reduce energy 
      consumption (e.g., biosynthesis of amino acids and lipids), and a shift in the 
      aerobic and anaerobic contributions to total metabolism. The observed 
      hypoxia-related changes in the liver proteome of the fish can help to understand 
      or can be related to the hypoxia-related response that takes place in similar 
      conditions in the liver or other proteomes of mammals.

TI  - Global mental health experiences of single mothers: A mixed methods research 
      synthesis.
PG  - 68-82
LID - 10.1111/jan.15461 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this research is to synthesize findings from primary studies 
      (quantitative and qualitative) that investigated the global mental health 
      experiences of single mothers to provide a deeper understanding to better care 
      and respond to the support needs of single mothers. DESIGN: Hayvaert et al.'s 
      mixed methods research synthesis approach. DATA SOURCES: The search process in 
      the following databases, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus resulted in eight 
      high-quality studies (5 qualitative and 3 quantitative) published between June 
      2016 and July 2021. REVIEW METHODS: Descriptive statistics and instrument scores 
      were provided in summary form. Themes were analysed using Krippendorff's content 
      analysis. A joint display was provided to reveal a complementary relationship 
      between two different data sets. RESULTS: A total of 348 single mothers 
      participated. Amongst the pooled sample, women identified as: Japanese (n = 174), 
      Israeli (n = 147), Black African (n = 18), African American (n = 9), Native 
      American (n = 5), Burundian-Australian (n = 8), UK British (n = 12), Asian 
      (n = 3), South Korean (n = 7), Indian (n = 2), Malaysian (n = 44), 
      Hispanic/Latina (n = 1) and Eastern European (n = 3). Four themes were 
      identified: (1) Learning to let go of the past, (2) It takes a whole village: 
      Importance of social support, (3) Seeking a self-reliant life: Challenges with 
      balancing career & childcare and (4) Finding strength within: Personal growth. 
      Only one intervention utilizing creative group counselling was found to 
      significantly decrease depression (p = .008), anxiety (p = .005), and stress 
      (p = .012) whilst increasing self-compassion (p = .013). CONCLUSION: It is 
      important for clinicians who care for single mothers, particularly if they 
      recently immigrated, are multiparous, and an ethnic minority to encourage 
      engagement in peer-initiated counselling and obtain mental health care as 
      necessary. IMPACT: This study identified and addressed the mental health issues 
      that single mothers face worldwide. This is also the first mixed methods research 
      synthesis to report single mothers' ethnicity in nursing and midwifery 
      literature. Thus, findings from this mixed methods research synthesis can help 
      nurses worldwide build culturally-concordant programs in their respective 
      community organizations and partners (e.g. community health centres, mother-child 
      enrichment clubs), inform health policies, and promote safer spaces for many 
      single mothers, particularly for those who will immigrate to the Global North 
      (i.e. UK, US, Canada) and become an ethnic minority.

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of brain-gut interaction 
      characterised by abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits. In the diarrhoea 
      subtype (IBS-D), altered epithelial barrier and mucosal immune activation are 
      associated with clinical manifestations. We aimed to further evaluate plasma 
      cells and epithelial integrity to gain understanding of IBS-D pathophysiology. 
      One mucosal jejunal biopsy and one stool sample were obtained from healthy 
      controls and IBS-D patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms, stress, and depression 
      scores were recorded. In the jejunal mucosa, RNAseq and gene set enrichment 
      analyses were performed. A morphometric analysis by electron microscopy 
      quantified plasma cell activation and proximity to enteric nerves and glycocalyx 
      thickness. Immunoglobulins concentration was assessed in the stool. IBS-D 
      patients showed differential expression of humoral pathways compared to controls. 
      Activation and proximity of plasma cells to nerves and IgG concentration were 
      also higher in IBS-D. Glycocalyx thickness was lower in IBS-D compared to 
      controls, and this reduction correlated with plasma cell activation, proximity to 
      nerves, and clinical symptoms. These results support humoral activity and loss of 
      epithelial integrity as important contributors to gut dysfunction and clinical 
      manifestations in IBS-D. Additional studies are needed to identify the triggers 
      of these alterations to better define IBS-D pathophysiology.

AB  - The wood frog survives frigid North American winters by retreating into a state 
      of suspended animation characterized by the freezing of up to 65% of total body 
      water as extracellular ice and displaying no heartbeat, breathing, brain 
      activity, or movement. Physiological and biochemical adaptations are in place to 
      facilitate global metabolic depression and protect against the consequences of 
      whole body freezing. This study examined the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) 
      transcription factor family, proteins responsible for coordinating selective gene 
      expression of a myriad of cellular functions from muscle development and 
      remodelling to various stress responses. Immunoblotting, subcellular 
      localization, and RT-PCR were used to analyze the regulation of MEF2A and MEF2C 
      transcription factors and selected downstream targets under their control at 
      transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels in skeletal and 
      cardiac muscles from control, frozen and thawed frogs. Both MEF2A/C proteins were 
      freeze-responsive in skeletal muscle, displaying increases of 1.7-2 fold for 
      phosphorylated MEF2A(Thr312) and MEF2C(Thr300) during freezing with an enrichment 
      of nuclear phosphorylated MEF2 proteins (by 1.7-2.1 fold) observed as early as 4h 
      post-freezing. Despite the reduced response of total and phosphorylated MEF2A/C 
      protein levels observed in cardiac muscle, the MEF2 downstream gene targets 
      (glucose transporter-4, calreticulin, and creatine kinase brain and muscle 
      isozymes) displayed similar increases in transcript levels (1.7-4.8 fold) after 
      24h freezing in both muscle types. This study describes a novel freeze-responsive 
      function for MEF2 transcription factors and further elaborates our understanding 
      of the molecular mechanisms underlying natural freeze tolerance. This novel 
      freeze-responsive regulation suggests a role for MEF2s and downstream genes in 
      cryoprotectant glucose distribution, calcium homeostasis, and maintenance of 
      energy reserves vital for successful freeze tolerance.

      and pathways between interactions with nature and socioemotional development in 
      children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing research indicates that spending time in nature is 
      associated with diverse aspects of children's health and wellbeing. Although 
      fundamental to later life chances and health, no systematic reviews, to our 
      knowledge, have focused specifically on the effects of interaction with nature on 
      socioemotional functioning in childhood. OBJECTIVES: Amongst children, what is 
      the consistency of associations between the availability of or spending time in 
      nature on socioemotional function and development? Furthermore, which child 
      behaviours and states independently associate with socioemotional function and 
      availability of or spending time in nature, and what is the consistency of 
      associations between these behaviours and states and contact with nature? DATA 
      SOURCES: Embase, Environment Complete, MEDLINE, and APA PsycINFO. Eligible 
      studies were backward and forward snowball-searched. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: 
      Studies investigating effects of, or associations between, availability of or 
      interaction with nature on socioemotional or proximal outcomes in children under 
      the age of 12 years were included in this review. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS 
      METHODS: The internal validity of studies investigating socioemotional outcomes 
      were based on assessments of elements of study design, conduct, and reporting to 
      identify potential issues related to confounding or other biases. The number of 
      analyses indicating positive, negative, and non-significant associations between 
      availability or interaction with green space and the outcomes were summed. 
      RESULTS: A total of 223 eligible full-texts, of which 43 pertained to 
      socioemotional outcomes and 180 to proximal outcomes, met eligibility criteria. 
      Positive associations between availability of and spending time in green space 
      were found with children's intra- and interpersonal socioemotional function and 
      development. Proportions of positive findings ranged from 13.9% to 55% across 
      experimental and observational research, exposures, populations, and contexts. 
      Modifying and mediating factors were identified. We found consistent evidence for 
      improved aspects of cognition and, for children over six years, reduced risk of 
      obesity and overweight in association with green space; consistent links between 
      movement behaviours in the experimental, but not observational research; 
      tentative trends suggesting associations with play, motor skills, language, 
      screen time, and communication skills; little evidence for positive associations 
      between green space and mood, physical wellbeing, and stress; some evidence for 
      associations with healthy birth outcomes, and little evidence for direct 
      associations between availability of green space and asthma and allergy 
      prevalence, however, mediation via, for example, air pollution was likely. 
      LIMITATIONS: We identified few studies without either probable or severe risk of 
      bias in at least one item. Improved study quality may therefore result in 
      different results. Restricting analyses to include only studies considered at low 
      risk of bias indicated similar or slightly lower proportions of positive 
      findings. Risk of bias in proximal outcomes was not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      empirical evidence for benefits of availability of and interaction green space 
      for child socioemotional function and development must currently be considered 
      limited. A number of proximal indicators were identified. Systematic review 
      registration number. PROSPERO ID: CRD42019135016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a multifactorial disease contributing to mortality 
      and neurological dysfunction. Isoliquiritin (ISL) has been reported to possess a 
      series of pharmacological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
      antifungal, anti-depression, anti-neurotoxicity and pro-angiogenesis activities 
      but whether it can be used for ischemic stroke treatment remains unknown. 
      PURPOSE: The goal of this study is to explore its therapeutic effect on ischemic 
      stroke and demonstrated the potential mechanism of ISL in zebrafish model. 
      METHODS: Using the photothrombotic-induced adult zebrafish model of ischemic 
      stroke, we visualized the telencephalon (Tel) and optic tectum (OT) infarction 
      injury at 24 h post-light exposure for 30 min by TTC and H&E staining. The effect 
      of ISL on neurological deficits was analyzed during open tank swimming by video 
      tracking. The antioxidant activity against ischemia injury was quantified by SOD, 
      GSH-Px and MDA assay. Transcriptome analysis of zebrafish Tel revealed how ISL 
      regulating gene expression to exert protective effect, which were also been 
      validated by real-time quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: We found for the first 
      time that the Tel tissue was the first damaged site of the whole brain and it 
      showed more sensitivity to the brain ischemic damage compared to the OT. ISL 
      reduced the rate of Tel injury, ameliorated neurological deficits as well as 
      counteracted oxidative damages by increasing SOD, GSH-Px and decreasing MDA 
      activity. GO enrichment demonstrated that ISL protected membrane and membrane 
      function as well as initiate immune regulation in the stress response after 
      ischemia. KEGG pathway analysis pointed out that immune-related pathways, 
      apoptosis as well as necroptosis pathways were more involved in the protective 
      mechanism of ISL. Furthermore, the log2 fold change in expression pattern of 25 
      genes detected by qRT-PCR was consistent with that by RNA-seq. CONCLUSIONS: Tel 
      was highly sensitive to the brain ischemia injury in zebrafish model of ischemic 
      stroke. ISL significantly exerted protective effect on Tel injury, neurological 
      deficits and oxidative damages. ISL could regulate a variety of genes related to 
      immune, apoptosis and necrosis pathways against complex cascade reaction after 
      ischemia. These findings enriched the study of ISL, making it a novel 
      multi-target agent for ischemic stroke treatment.

TI  - Enrichment Effects on Adult Cognitive Development: Can the Functional Capacity of 
      Older Adults Be Preserved and Enhanced?
PG  - 1-65
LID - 10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01034.x [doi]
AB  - In this monograph, we ask whether various kinds of intellectual, physical, and 
      social activities produce cognitive enrichment effects-that is, whether they 
      improve cognitive performance at different points of the adult life span, with a 
      particular emphasis on old age. We begin with a theoretical framework that 
      emphasizes the potential of behavior to influence levels of cognitive 
      functioning. According to this framework, the undeniable presence of age-related 
      decline in cognition does not invalidate the view that behavior can enhance 
      cognitive functioning. Instead, the course of normal aging shapes a zone of 
      possible functioning, which reflects person-specific endowments and age-related 
      constraints. Individuals influence whether they function in the higher or lower 
      ranges of this zone by engaging in or refraining from beneficial intellectual, 
      physical, and social activities. From this point of view, the potential for 
      positive change, or plasticity, is maintained in adult cognition. It is an 
      argument that is supported by newer research in neuroscience showing neural 
      plasticity in various aspects of central nervous system functioning, 
      neurochemistry, and architecture. This view of human potential contrasts with 
      static conceptions of cognition in old age, according to which decline in 
      abilities is fixed and individuals cannot slow its course. Furthermore, any 
      understanding of cognition as it occurs in everyday life must make a distinction 
      between basic cognitive mechanisms and skills (such as working-memory capacity) 
      and the functional use of cognition to achieve goals in specific situations. In 
      practice, knowledge and expertise are critical for effective functioning, and the 
      available evidence suggests that older adults effectively employ specific 
      knowledge and expertise and can gain new knowledge when it is required. We 
      conclude that, on balance, the available evidence favors the hypothesis that 
      maintaining an intellectually engaged and physically active lifestyle promotes 
      successful cognitive aging. First, cognitive-training studies have demonstrated 
      that older adults can improve cognitive functioning when provided with intensive 
      training in strategies that promote thinking and remembering. The early training 
      literature suggested little transfer of function from specifically trained skills 
      to new cognitive tasks; learning was highly specific to the cognitive processes 
      targeted by training. Recently, however, a new generation of studies suggests 
      that providing structured experience in situations demanding executive 
      coordination of skills-such as complex video games, task-switching paradigms, and 
      divided attention tasks-train strategic control over cognition that does show 
      transfer to different task environments. These studies suggest that there is 
      considerable reserve potential in older adults' cognition that can be enhanced 
      through training. Second, a considerable number of studies indicate that 
      maintaining a lifestyle that is intellectually stimulating predicts better 
      maintenance of cognitive skills and is associated with a reduced risk of 
      developing Alzheimer's disease in late life. Our review focuses on longitudinal 
      evidence of a connection between an active lifestyle and enhanced cognition, 
      because such evidence admits fewer rival explanations of observed effects (or 
      lack of effects) than does cross-sectional evidence. The longitudinal evidence 
      consistently shows that engaging in intellectually stimulating activities is 
      associated with better cognitive functioning at later points in time. Other 
      studies show that meaningful social engagement is also predictive of better 
      maintenance of cognitive functioning in old age. These longitudinal findings are 
      also open to important rival explanations, but overall, the available evidence 
      suggests that activities can postpone decline, attenuate decline, or provide 
      prosthetic benefit in the face of normative cognitive decline, while at the same 
      time indicating that late-life cognitive changes can result in curtailment of 
      activities. Given the complexity of the dynamic reciprocal relationships between 
      stimulating activities and cognitive function in old age, additional research 
      will be needed to address the extent to which observed effects validate a causal 
      influence of an intellectually engaged lifestyle on cognition. Nevertheless, the 
      hypothesis that an active lifestyle that requires cognitive effort has long-term 
      benefits for older adults' cognition is at least consistent with the available 
      data. Furthermore, new intervention research that involves multimodal 
      interventions focusing on goal-directed action requiring cognition (such as 
      reading to children) and social interaction will help to address whether an 
      active lifestyle enhances cognitive function. Third, there is a parallel 
      literature suggesting that physical activity, and aerobic exercise in particular, 
      enhances older adults' cognitive function. Unlike the literature on an active 
      lifestyle, there is already an impressive array of work with humans and animal 
      populations showing that exercise interventions have substantial benefits for 
      cognitive function, particularly for aspects of fluid intelligence and executive 
      function. Recent neuroscience research on this topic indicates that exercise has 
      substantial effects on brain morphology and function, representing a plausible 
      brain substrate for the observed effects of aerobic exercise and other activities 
      on cognition. Our review identifies a number of areas where additional research 
      is needed to address critical questions. For example, there is considerable 
      epidemiological evidence that stress and chronic psychological distress are 
      negatively associated with changes in cognition. In contrast, less is known about 
      how positive attributes, such as self-efficacy, a sense of control, and a sense 
      of meaning in life, might contribute to preservation of cognitive function in old 
      age. It is well known that certain personality characteristics such as 
      conscientiousness predict adherence to an exercise regimen, but we do not know 
      whether these attributes are also relevant to predicting maintenance of cognitive 
      function or effective compensation for cognitive decline when it occurs. 
      Likewise, more information is needed on the factors that encourage maintenance of 
      an active lifestyle in old age in the face of elevated risk for physiological 
      decline, mechanical wear and tear on the body, and incidence of diseases with 
      disabling consequences, and whether efforts to maintain an active lifestyle are 
      associated with successful aging, both in terms of cognitive function and 
      psychological and emotional well-being. We also discuss briefly some interesting 
      issues for society and public policy regarding cognitive-enrichment effects. For 
      example, should efforts to enhance cognitive function be included as part of a 
      general prevention model for enhancing health and vitality in old age? We also 
      comment on the recent trend of business marketing interventions claimed to build 
      brain power and prevent age-related cognitive decline, and the desirability of 
      direct research evidence to back claims of effectiveness for specific products.
